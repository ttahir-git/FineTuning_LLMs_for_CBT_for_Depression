They incorporate Naomi's suggestions and address her concerns.  However, the collaboration could be strengthened by offering Naomi more choices and actively involving her in decision-making.  For example, instead of directly suggesting progressive muscle relaxation, the therapist could have presented several relaxation options and allowed Naomi to choose the one that resonated most with her.  This would foster a stronger sense of ownership and empower Naomi to take a more active role in her therapy."", ""Pacing and Efficient Use of Time"": ""The session covers several important topics, including progress review, addressing a new challenge, introducing a new relaxation technique, and developing an action plan.  The therapist generally maintains a good flow and transitions smoothly between topics.  However, the extensive time spent on explaining and practicing progressive muscle relaxation might have taken away from exploring the underlying cognitive factors contributing to Naomi's anxiety.  A more time-efficient approach could have involved providing a handout or online resources for PMR and focusing more on cognitive restructuring during the session itself."", ""Guided Discovery"": ""While the therapist asks Naomi to identify negative thoughts, there's limited use of Socratic questioning to guide her towards deeper self-discovery.  The therapist tends to offer solutions and suggestions rather than facilitating Naomi's own exploration of her thoughts and beliefs.  For example, instead of directly suggesting alternative outcomes, the therapist could have asked questions like, \\"", ""Focusing on Key Cognitions or Behaviors"": ""The therapist identifies the key behavior of procrastinating the meeting and the associated negative thoughts.  However, the focus remains primarily on managing the anxiety symptoms rather than deeply exploring the core beliefs driving these thoughts.  A more focused approach would involve identifying and challenging the underlying assumptions about the advisor's potential reaction and Naomi's self-worth as a student.  This would address the root of the problem rather than just the surface-level symptoms."", ""Strategy for Change"": ""The therapist employs a combination of cognitive and behavioral techniques, including identifying negative thoughts, developing an action plan, and practicing relaxation.  However, the overall strategy lacks a clearly defined, overarching framework.  It appears more as a collection of techniques rather than a cohesive, integrated approach.  A more robust strategy would involve explicitly linking the techniques to the identified problem and outlining a clear path towards achieving Naomi's goals.  This would provide a stronger sense of direction and purpose for the therapy."", ""Application of Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques"": ""The therapist demonstrates basic competency in applying techniques like identifying negative thoughts and developing an action plan.  However, the application of cognitive techniques could be significantly improved.

The therapist dictated the topics, primarily focusing on review and follow-up from the previous session.  CTRS criteria for an 'Outstanding' agenda involve mutual agreement and prioritization.  This session missed the opportunity to explore Naomi's immediate concerns and prioritize accordingly.  For example, Naomi expresses nervousness about the meeting itself, indicating a potential shift in priority.  A more collaborative approach would have explored this anxiety further and potentially adjusted the session focus.  This deficiency could lead to the patient feeling unheard and less invested in the therapy process."", ""Feedback"": ""The therapist solicited initial feedback on the previous session summary, which is positive. However, throughout the session, feedback was limited to responses to direct questions.  The therapist didn't actively check for understanding or emotional responses to interventions.  For instance, after suggesting practicing PMR before the meeting, the therapist should have checked Naomi's reaction to this suggestion rather than moving on.  This lack of consistent feedback gathering prevents the therapist from tailoring the session to Naomi's real-time needs and understanding, potentially hindering the development of a strong therapeutic alliance and impacting treatment outcomes."", ""Understanding"": ""The therapist demonstrated basic understanding of Naomi's explicit statements.  However, there's a lack of exploration of underlying emotions and cognitions.  Naomi mentions nervousness about the meeting, but the therapist's response focuses on practical solutions (notes, outline) rather than exploring the root of this anxiety.  A deeper understanding of Naomi's internal reality, including her specific worries and thought processes, is crucial for effective CBT.  This missed opportunity could prevent addressing core beliefs and developing more targeted interventions."", ""Interpersonal Effectiveness"": ""The therapist maintained a polite and professional demeanor.  The language used was supportive and encouraging.  However, the interaction lacked a degree of warmth and genuine connection.  While not overtly negative, the therapist's responses felt somewhat formulaic and lacked personalized empathy.  Improving interpersonal effectiveness could involve incorporating more empathetic statements that validate Naomi's feelings and experiences, fostering a stronger therapeutic bond."", ""Collaboration"": ""The session lacked true collaboration.  The therapist directed the conversation and offered solutions, while Naomi primarily responded to questions.  CTRS emphasizes patient involvement in problem definition and solution finding.  This session missed opportunities to empower Naomi in the process.

There were limited attempts to help Naomi explore her own thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions.  For example, instead of suggesting practicing PMR before the meeting, the therapist could have guided Naomi to consider different coping strategies and evaluate their potential effectiveness.  This lack of guided discovery hinders Naomi's ability to develop self-awareness and independent problem-solving skills, crucial for long-term success in CBT."", ""Focusing on Key Cognitions or Behaviors"": ""While the therapist touched upon relevant behaviors (PMR, journaling), there was insufficient focus on underlying cognitions driving Naomi's anxiety.

Identifying and challenging these cognitions is essential for effective CBT.  Failure to address these core beliefs could limit the impact of behavioral interventions."", ""Strategy for Change"": ""The therapist employed some CBT techniques (PMR, journaling), but the overall strategy for change lacked clarity and depth.  The connection between these techniques and Naomi's specific anxieties and challenges wasn't explicitly articulated.  A more robust strategy would involve collaboratively developing a personalized plan that targets specific cognitive and behavioral patterns, outlining clear goals and steps for achieving lasting change."", ""Application of Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques"": ""The therapist utilized basic CBT techniques like PMR and journaling. However, the application lacked depth and sophistication.  For example, while PMR was practiced, there was no discussion of how to adapt it to specific anxiety-provoking situations.
