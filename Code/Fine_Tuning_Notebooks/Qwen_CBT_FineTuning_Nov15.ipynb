Here is the summary you provided me at the end of our last session:\\n\\n- Main topics discussed: Challenging perfectionistic thoughts, addressing guilt around self-care, and improving sleep quality.\\n- Techniques or exercises used: Thought records, CBT triangle, downward arrow technique, identifying intermediate and core beliefs, cognitive restructuring, and sleep hygiene strategies. In future sessions, we will continue practicing these techniques and introduce new ones as needed, such as cognitive and behavioral experiments, reframing core beliefs, and addressing specific depressive symptoms like rumination and social withdrawal.\\n- Homework assigned: Continue working on thought records, focusing on challenging perfectionistic thoughts and guilt around self-care; implement sleep hygiene strategies, including establishing a consistent sleep routine, engaging in relaxing activities before bed, and creating a comfortable sleep environment; gather evidence against the core belief that taking time for oneself means being a failure or unworthy of love and respect.\\n- Patient\\'s progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details: Amira demonstrated progress in identifying and challenging perfectionistic thoughts and is open to practicing self-compassion and sleep hygiene techniques. She continues to struggle with low energy, motivation, and self-critical thoughts but is committed to engaging in the therapeutic process and making meaningful changes.\\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs: Reviewed Amira\\'s core belief about being a failure and unworthy of love and respect if she takes time for herself, and explored its connection to intermediate beliefs about always needing to be productive and viewing self-care as selfish or indulgent. Introduced techniques for challenging these beliefs and developing more balanced and self-compassionate perspectives.\\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions: Amira\\'s tendency to be self-critical and hold herself to unrealistic standards; her commitment to practicing self-compassion, sleep hygiene, and engaging in enjoyable activities; the specific, measurable goals identified for therapy; the progress made in challenging negative beliefs and developing more balanced perspectives.\\n- Plan for the next session: Review Amira\\'s progress with homework assignments, particularly the thought records, sleep hygiene, and gathering evidence against her core belief; continue practicing cognitive restructuring, mindfulness, and reframing core beliefs; explore any challenges or insights that came up during the week; introduce new techniques as needed to address specific depressive symptoms and expand on cognitive and behavioral experiments.\\nTherapist: Hello Amira, it\\'s great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don\\'t have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there\\'s a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I\\'m unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I\\'m committed to working with you to the best of my abilities. How are you feeling today?\\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your commitment to helping me. I\\'ve been feeling a bit better since our last session, but I\\'m still struggling with low energy and motivation. I\\'ve been trying to implement the sleep hygiene strategies we discussed, and I think they\\'re starting to help a little.\\nTherapist: I\\'m glad to hear that you\\'ve noticed some improvement with your sleep, even if it\\'s just a little. Small changes can make a big difference over time. Let\\'s start by exploring your mood and experiences since our last session. Can you tell me more about how your energy and motivation have been affected?\\nPatient: Well, I\\'ve been trying to push myself to do more, but I still feel exhausted most of the time. Even small tasks seem to drain me, and I find myself putting things off because I don\\'t have the energy. It\\'s frustrating because I know there are things I want to do, but I just can\\'t seem to get started.\\nTherapist: It sounds like you\\'re experiencing a lot of frustration and exhaustion. That can be a challenging cycle to break. Have you noticed any patterns or specific situations that seem to trigger these feelings?\\nPatient: I think it\\'s worst in the mornings, especially on weekdays when I know I have to go to work. The thought of facing the day just feels overwhelming. I\\'ve also noticed that I tend to feel more drained after social interactions, even if they\\'re positive.\\nTherapist: That\\'s a great observation about the patterns you\\'ve noticed. Recognizing those triggers is an important step in finding ways to manage them. Let\\'s keep that in mind as we plan our agenda for today\\'s session. What would you like to prioritize?\\nPatient: I\\'d like to focus on finding ways to improve my energy and motivation. I think if I could make some progress there, it would help with a lot of the other challenges I\\'m facing.\\nTherapist: Absolutely, that\\'s a great goal. We can definitely explore some strategies for improving energy and motivation. I\\'d also like to check in on your progress with the thought records and challenging perfectionistic thoughts. And if we have time, we could discuss some cognitive and behavioral experiments to help gather evidence against your core belief about self-care. How does that sound?\\nPatient: That sounds good. I\\'ve been working on the thought records, but I\\'m still finding it challenging to reframe my thoughts in the moment. I think some more practice with that would be helpful.\\nTherapist: Great, we can definitely review your thought records and practice reframing together. Before we dive into that, let\\'s set some specific goals for our session today. What would you like to achieve by the end of our time together?\\nPatient: By the end of the session, I\\'d like to have a better understanding of how my thoughts are impacting my energy and motivation, and some concrete strategies I can use to start making changes in those areas. I\\'d also like to feel more confident in my ability to challenge my perfectionistic thoughts and beliefs about self-care.\\nPatient: I\\'ve been trying to work on the thought records, but I\\'m still finding it hard to reframe my thoughts in the moment. I think I could use some more practice with that.\\nTherapist: I\\'m glad you brought that up. Reframing thoughts can be challenging, especially when we\\'re dealing with deeply ingrained patterns of thinking. Let\\'s take a look at one of your thought records from the past week. Can you share an example of a situation where you struggled to reframe your thoughts?\\nPatient: Sure. Last Wednesday, I was running late for a meeting at work, and I couldn\\'t find the report I needed. I started thinking, \"I\\'m such a failure. I can\\'t even keep track of my own work. Everyone\\'s going to think I\\'m incompetent.\"', 'output': \"That's a great example. Let's break this down using the thought record. First, can you identify the emotions you were feeling in that moment and rate their intensity on a scale of 0-100?\"}\n"
