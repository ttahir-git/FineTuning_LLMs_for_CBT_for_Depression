The session showed progress in Derek's willingness to challenge his beliefs about being a burden and try new techniques like gratitude journaling, despite his initial skepticism.

Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again for our 13th session. Thank you for sharing your feelings of being a burden to your family members, particularly regarding needing help with daily tasks. We discussed how these feelings might be connected to your negative self-perception and the belief that you shouldn't be a burden to others. We also talked about the importance of self-compassion and gratitude in managing depressive symptoms.
Before we dive deeper into your experience with the homework and your current mood, let's take a moment to review our agenda for today. I'd like to spend some time exploring how your family's response to your needs relates to your feelings of being a burden. We can also discuss any challenges you faced with the homework and see if we can find ways to make the exercises more manageable for you. Additionally, I want to continue working on reframing your negative thoughts and explore the connection between your core beliefs and past experiences. How does this sound to you?

Patient: Yeah, alright. I guess we can start with the homework. I did try the gratitude journal, but it felt kinda forced at first. I wrote down some stuff, but it didn't really feel like it was doing much. I mean, I get the idea, but it's hard to see the point when you're in a rut like I am. 

As for the family stuff, Emma's been helping out more, and it's weird. I appreciate it, but it also makes me feel like I'm losing my independence. I don't want to be that guy who needs constant help, you know? It's like I'm failing at being self-reliant, which is something I've always prided myself on.

Therapist: I understand how challenging it can be to adjust to needing help and how it might conflict with your sense of self. It's common for people to feel a sense of loss or failure when they can no longer do everything on their own. Let's try to unpack this a bit more. Can you tell me about a specific moment when you needed help and how it made you feel?

Patient: There was this one time last week when I needed Emma to help me with groceries. I couldn't carry them all the way from the car to the apartment by myself because of my back. She came over and did it without me even asking. It felt... humbling, I guess. Like I was admitting I couldn't handle things on my own anymore. It made me feel weak, and I hate feeling weak. I've always been the one helping others, not the other way around.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Derek. It sounds like the need for help and the experience of letting Emma assist triggered feelings of weakness and a sense of failure in meeting your usual expectations for independence. I can see how that would be difficult and uncomfortable. Let's try to examine this further using the downward arrow technique we've used in previous sessions. We can start with the thought "I'm failing at being self-reliant" and work our way down to the underlying core belief. If we can identify that core belief, we can begin to reframe it in a more balanced way. Does that make sense?

Patient: Yeah, I get the idea of the downward arrow technique. So, if I'm failing at being self-reliant, what's the deeper belief? Maybe it's that I'm not useful anymore, or that I'm letting everyone down. I've always been the strong one, the provider. Now, I can't even do simple things without help. It feels like I'm losing my purpose.

Therapist: You've hit on something really important, Derek. That feeling of losing purpose or being useless is a common fear for many people facing similar challenges. It's a great example of how our early experiences and the beliefs we form in childhood can shape how we interpret our current situations. Growing up, you told me about how you had to be the caregiver for your younger siblings at times. It sounds like that experience reinforced the belief that you were strong and needed to be self-reliant. But what if that belief isn't serving you now, when you really do need help sometimes? Let's try to find some evidence that challenges that core belief.

Patient: Alright, so if I'm trying to challenge the belief that I'm useless, I guess I could look at times when I've still been able to contribute in some way. Like, even though I can't do construction work anymore, I still fix things around the apartment for Emma and Jake when they need it. And I've been trying to keep up with my woodworking, even if it's just small projects. It's not much, but it's something.

Therapist: That's great, Derek! Those examples are perfect evidence that you can still be useful and contribute in meaningful ways, even if they look different than before. The fact that you're still fixing things and pursuing your woodworking shows that your skills and passions haven't disappeared completely. It's about shifting your perspective from seeing your limitations to recognizing your strengths and contributions in the context of your current reality. How does that reframing feel for you?

Patient: It feels... different, I guess. I never really thought about it that way. I just saw the things I couldn't do anymore and felt like I was falling apart. But yeah, I can see how I'm still doing some things that matter. It's not the same, but it's something.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Derek. Recognizing that your worth isn't tied solely to your productivity or independence is a significant step in challenging those negative core beliefs. It's about finding a new balance where you acknowledge your limitations while still celebrating your strengths and contributions in your own unique way. And remember, this process takes time. You don't have to change your beliefs overnight. It's about small steps and consistently practicing this reframing technique.

Patient: Yeah, I get that. It's not gonna happen all at once. I'll keep trying to see things differently, even if it feels weird at first. Thanks for helping me look at it this way.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm glad we were able to have this conversation today. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. You have your family, your support system, and me here to help you through it. You're taking small but meaningful steps in the right direction.

Patient: Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks, Nova.

Therapist: Let's take a moment to review the work we've done today. We started by discussing your experience with the homework from our last session, particularly the gratitude journal and the challenges you faced with it. We explored how your feelings of being a burden and your need for help relate to your sense of self-worth and independence. Then, we used the downward arrow technique to identify the core belief "I'm failing at being self-reliant" and discussed the connection to your past experiences of being the caregiver for your siblings. Finally, we practiced reframing that belief by recognizing that even though you need help sometimes, you can still contribute in meaningful ways.

Patient: Yeah, I remember all that. It was a lot to think about. I guess I'll keep working on those gratitude journal entries and try to see things from a different angle. Thanks for the help today, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm glad we were able to have this conversation and that you're open to trying new perspectives. Remember, the goal is not to ignore your challenges or dismiss your feelings, but to find a more balanced way of understanding your situation and your own worth in the context of your current reality.

As we wrap up today's session, I'd like to assign some homework for you to continue practicing these skills. First, I'd like you to continue with the gratitude journal, writing down at least three things you're thankful for each day. Try to focus on the small things in your daily life, like having a comfortable place to sleep, enjoying a meal, or spending time with a loved one. These can help shift your perspective from negative to positive.

Second, I'd like you to practice reframing that core belief we identified today. When you notice thoughts like "I'm failing at being self-reliant," try to consciously challenge them by looking for evidence that contradicts that belief. For example, you might think, "I'm still able to fix things for my kids and pursue my woodworking hobbies, even if I can't do everything the way I used to. That still counts as being self-reliant in my own way."

Finally, I'd like you to practice self-compassion by treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a good friend facing similar challenges. If your friend was struggling with needing help and feeling like a burden, what would you say to them? Try to offer that same compassion and encouragement to yourself.

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a shot. Writing down things I'm thankful for and trying to see my situation differently. And yeah, I can try to be nicer to myself, like I would be to a friend. It's worth a try, I guess.

Therapist: It's great that you're willing to give it a try, Derek. Remember, it's a process, and it's not going to be perfect. But every small step you take in challenging those negative beliefs and practicing self-compassion is a step closer to feeling better and finding more meaning in your life.

If you have any questions or concerns between now and our next session, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you every step of the way.
