Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Yeah, I've been alright, I guess. Still dealing with the same old stuff—pain, money problems, trying to keep in touch with my kids. It's a grind, you know? But I've been writing down my thoughts before talking to them, like you suggested. It helps a little, but it's still tough.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear you've been trying to apply what we've discussed, even if it's challenging. It takes a lot of effort to keep pushing through the tough times. I want to help you find ways to cope that work for you. Can you tell me a bit more about your situation right now? I want to understand how your pain, finances, and relationship with your kids are impacting you.

Patient: Well, the pain's always there, like a constant nag. It's hard to do anything without it flaring up. Finances are a mess—disability checks don't cover much, and I'm behind on bills. As for my kids, I feel like I'm losing them. They don't understand why I can't be the dad I used to be. It's like I'm failing them, and that hurts more than anything.

Therapist: That sounds like a really tough situation, Derek. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. The pain and financial stress are making everything harder, and the loss of your kids' understanding is a deep wound. I want to help you process these feelings and find some ways to cope. But first, I think it's important to address something you mentioned in your last session. You said you've been considering reaching out to a trusted friend for support. How has that been going?

Patient: I haven't reached out to anyone yet. It's hard to swallow my pride and ask for help. I keep thinking I should be able to handle this on my own, like I always have. But maybe that's part of the problem, right?

Therapist: Absolutely, Derek. Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness; it's a sign of strength. It takes courage to reach out when you're struggling. I'm glad you've recognized that you might be holding yourself back by trying to do everything alone. Let's explore this further. What thoughts come up when you think about reaching out to a trusted friend or loved one?

Patient: I guess I worry they'll think I'm a burden. Like, they've got their own lives and problems. Why should they have to deal with mine too? And then there's the fear that they won't understand or won't want to help. It's easier to just keep it all inside.

Therapist: That fear of being a burden is a common one, but it's not an accurate reflection of how most people feel when someone they care about is struggling. It's possible that your trusted friends want to help but don't know how. Reaching out could be the first step in opening up new lines of communication and support. What do you think about trying that? We can break it down into smaller steps if it feels overwhelming.

As we move forward in today's session, I think it would be helpful to set some specific goals. You mentioned wanting to cope better with pain and stress, reconnect with your kids, and find support outside of therapy. Those are big picture goals, but let's break them down into smaller, more manageable steps. What do you think about focusing on one or two of those areas today?

Patient: I think focusing on reconnecting with my kids sounds like a good place to start. It's been weighing on me, and I know I need to do something about it. Maybe we can figure out a way to make that easier or less stressful.

Therapist: I think that's a great idea, Derek. Reconnecting with your kids is important, and it's something we can work on together. But before we dive into that, I want to acknowledge some of the progress you've made since we started therapy. You mentioned that you've been writing down your thoughts before talking to your kids. That's a big step, and it shows that you're working hard to communicate more effectively. We've also been discussing the importance of reaching out for support from trusted friends or loved ones. Have you noticed any changes in your relationships or stress levels since we've started working on these issues?

Patient: Well, I haven't reached out to anyone yet, but I've been thinking about it more. And writing down my thoughts before talking to my kids has helped a bit. It's still tough, but it's something. I guess I'm just trying to take it one step at a time.

Therapist: That's really great to hear, Derek. You're making progress, even if it feels slow sometimes. It's important to recognize that progress isn't always linear, and every step counts. You're doing the best you can in a really challenging situation, and that's something to be proud of. As we move forward in therapy, we'll continue to work on building your skills and finding ways to cope with the pain, stress, and loss you've been experiencing. But I also want to help you find support outside of therapy, because it's important not to carry everything on your own.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate that. It's just hard to see the progress sometimes, you know? But I'll keep at it. And yeah, finding support outside of therapy is something I need to work on too. It's not easy, but I'll try.

Therapist: You're right, it's not easy at all. But you're not alone in this. I'm here to support you, and there are other people who care about you too. We'll work on identifying those people and figuring out how to reach out to them in a way that feels safe and manageable for you. For now, let's focus on reconnecting with your kids. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going through your mind when you think about that?

Patient: Well, I guess I'm worried that they'll see me as a failure. I always wanted to be the strong, dependable dad, and now I feel like I've let them down. Plus, I know I've missed out on a lot of their lives because of my own issues. It's hard to know where to start.

Therapist: I can understand why that would be scary, Derek. It's a really big change to go from being the provider and authority figure to having to rebuild those relationships as a disabled father. I want to help you find ways to reconnect with your kids that feel safe and manageable, but first, I think it would be helpful to unpack some of those fears a bit more. What do you think it means if your kids see you as a failure? How does that play out in your head?

Patient: If they see me as a failure, I think it means they'll be disappointed in me. They might think I'm weak or that I gave up. And that just makes me feel even worse about myself. I don't want them to think that I'm not the same person they knew before.

Therapist: I can see why that would be tough, Derek. It sounds like there's a lot of fear and shame wrapped up in the idea of your kids seeing you differently than you were before your injury. But I want to challenge that a bit. What does it mean to be weak or to give up? Is it possible that your kids might understand, or even admire, your courage in the face of these challenges?

Patient: I guess it's possible, but it's hard to see it that way. I've always been the one to fix things, to be strong. Now, I can't even do that. It feels like I'm letting them down, no matter how you look at it.

Therapist: That's a really important insight, Derek. You're recognizing that the roles you played before have shifted, and it feels like it's on you to fix that. But the fact is, you're dealing with a real injury, and it's not something you can fix in the same way you used to. But it's also not something you can take responsibility for. That's on everyone else, not you.

Patient: Yeah, I get that, but it's still hard to let go of that feeling. I guess I just need to give it time and keep trying to reach out. It's not going to be easy, but I'll keep working on it.

Therapist: You're right, Derek. It's not going to be easy, and it's okay to need time. Let's break it down a bit. What do you think would be the first step in reaching out to your kids?

Patient: I think maybe just sending a text or giving them a call. Nothing too heavy, just checking in and seeing how they're doing. Maybe ask if they want to catch up over coffee or something.

Therapist: That sounds like a great first step, Derek. It's a low-pressure way to open the lines of communication and show that you're thinking about them. And you're right, it doesn't have to be anything heavy right away. It's about building back that connection slowly and steadily.

Patient: Yeah, I think that's the best way to go about it. I'll give it a try and see how it goes. Thanks for the support, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm here to support you, and I think this is a great plan. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. But every step counts, and you're doing the best you can in a really tough situation. I'm proud of you for keeping at it, even when it's hard.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate that. It means a lot to hear that someone believes in me, even when I don't always believe in myself.

Therapist: You're doing great, Derek. I want to encourage you to keep reaching out to your kids, and we'll continue to work on building your support system outside of therapy. You're making important progress, and it's something to be proud of.

As we wrap up today's session, I want to give you a homework assignment to help you continue to practice these skills. I'd like you to try to reach out to one of your kids this week, either through a text or a call. If it feels appropriate, you can ask if they'd be willing to meet up for coffee or another activity. The goal is to start building those connections back, one step at a time.

In addition, I want you to continue writing down your thoughts before talking to your kids. This can help you stay grounded and communicate more effectively.

How do you feel about that homework assignment?

Patient: I think it's a good idea. I'll give it a shot and see how it goes. Writing down my thoughts might help me stay focused and not get too worked up. Thanks for the suggestion, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. Remember, it's okay if it's not perfect the first time. The important thing is that you're making an effort to connect with your kids. I have faith in you.

Before we end, I want to do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now, after our session today?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful, to be honest. It's been tough, but knowing I'm not alone in this helps. Thanks for listening, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling a bit more hopeful. That's a really important thing. And remember, you're not alone. I'm here to support you, and I believe in you.

Let's plan to meet again next week, at our usual time. In the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
