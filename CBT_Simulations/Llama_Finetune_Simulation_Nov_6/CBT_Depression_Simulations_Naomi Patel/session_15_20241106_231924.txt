Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again for our 15th CBT session. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. It's always helpful to start by reviewing what we discussed last time. From your summary, it seems like we focused on addressing the guilt you experience around taking breaks. We explored some strategies to challenge those guilty thoughts and create coping mechanisms to help you prioritize self-care. Before we dive into today's session, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate might be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I can't observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm committed to doing my best to support you in your journey towards better mental health. How are you feeling today, and what's been on your mind since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. It's good to be aware of those. I appreciate your transparency.

I'm feeling a bit better today, actually. I've been trying to stick to the break schedule we talked about, and it's been helping. I still have moments of guilt, but using the coping card has made it easier to challenge those thoughts. 

One thing that's been on my mind is how to balance my academic responsibilities with self-care. I have a big research paper due soon, and I'm worried that taking breaks will make me fall behind. I know we've talked about breaks being beneficial, but the pressure to perform is really high right now.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you've been implementing the break schedule and using the coping card. It's a positive sign that you're making progress in managing your guilt around self-care. I understand your concerns about balancing your academic responsibilities and taking breaks. It's a common challenge, especially when you feel there's a lot riding on a particular project or assignment. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and feelings that come up when you think about taking breaks during your research paper work?

Patient: Sure, when I think about taking breaks while working on my research paper, I feel a mix of anxiety and guilt. I worry that if I take a break, I won't be able to get back into the flow of work, and that it will take longer to finish the paper. I also feel guilty because I'm already behind on some other assignments, and I feel like I should be working non-stop to catch up. It's like there's this voice in my head telling me that breaks are a luxury I can't afford right now.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It's a great example of how our thoughts and feelings can interact to create a sense of urgency and fear around self-care. Let's take a closer look at these thoughts using the CBT model. The thought "If I take a break, I won't be able to get back into the flow of work" contains a cognitive distortion called "fortune-telling," where you're predicting a negative outcome without evidence. The thought "I should be working non-stop to catch up" has a distortion called "should statements," which often lead to feelings of guilt and inadequacy. 

Given the pressure you're experiencing, it might be helpful to focus on your emotional state during this session. We can explore ways to manage your anxiety and guilt, and discuss strategies for communicating your needs to your professors if you're concerned about deadlines. What do you think about setting an agenda focused on emotional management and communicating needs?

Patient: That makes sense. I can see how those thoughts are distorted now. I think focusing on emotional management and communicating my needs is a good idea. I do feel overwhelmed by the pressure, and I think figuring out how to talk to my professors about my situation could really help. I'm just not sure how to approach them without feeling like I'm making excuses.

Therapist: It's understandable to feel unsure about communicating your needs, but it's a skill that can be developed. Let's start by exploring some strategies for managing your anxiety and guilt, and then we can discuss how to frame your conversations with your professors in a clear and assertive way. 

For anxiety management, I'd like to introduce a technique called "progressive muscle relaxation." This involves systematically tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body, which can help reduce overall tension and promote relaxation. We can also review some of the relaxation techniques we've discussed before, like deep breathing and grounding exercises. 

For guilt management, we can continue using the thought record technique to examine evidence for and against guilty thoughts, and practice reframing those thoughts in a more balanced way. It might also be helpful to explore your inner dialogue around breaks, and practice responding to those thoughts with self-compassion and realistic expectations.

How do you feel about incorporating these strategies into your homework for this week?

Patient: I think incorporating those strategies sounds really helpful. Progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing exercises could be great for managing my anxiety. And continuing with the thought record technique for guilt management makes sense too. I'll definitely try to practice those this week. 

As for talking to my professors, I think I need some guidance on how to frame my situation without sounding like I'm making excuses. Any tips on how to approach that conversation?

Therapist: It's great that you're open to trying these strategies and want to work on communicating your needs. Framing your situation in a clear and assertive way is an important skill that can help you advocate for yourself effectively. One helpful way to approach the conversation is to be prepared with specific, concrete information about what you need and when you need it.

For example, you could say something like: "I wanted to let you know that I've been dealing with some family issues lately, which have made it difficult for me to dedicate as much time to my research as I'd like. I'm committed to completing the research paper on schedule, but I'm going to need a few extra days to manage my workload and ensure that I can do the project justice. Here is a revised schedule that outlines when I can submit my draft and when the final copy is due."

By being specific and direct, you show your professor that you take your responsibilities seriously and are taking active steps to address your situation. This can help prevent them from seeing it as an excuse, but rather as a request for support and understanding.

Another important aspect is to practice self-compassion and empathy during the conversation. Remind yourself that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Try to approach the conversation with a growth mindset, recognizing that this experience can help you become more resilient and effective in the future.

What do you think about this approach?

Patient: That approach sounds really practical and clear. I think it will help me feel more confident when talking to my professors. I like the idea of being specific about what I need and providing a revised schedule. It shows that I'm taking responsibility and not just making excuses.

I'll definitely practice this approach and try to be more assertive in my conversations. It's a skill I want to develop, and this seems like a good way to start. Thanks for the guidance, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi. I'm glad this approach resonates with you. Remember, practicing assertiveness is a process, and it's okay if it feels challenging at first. You're developing a new skill, and that takes time and practice.

As we discussed earlier, we'll also continue to work on managing anxiety and guilt using the progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing exercises, and thought record technique. These skills can help you feel more grounded and self-compassionate as you navigate your academic responsibilities and personal challenges.

For homework, I'd like you to practice the progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing exercises daily, especially when you feel stressed or overwhelmed. Try to set aside time each day to complete a thought record, focusing on any anxious or guilty thoughts that come up, and practice reframing them in a more balanced way.

Finally, I encourage you to have at least one conversation with a professor about your academic needs. Use the assertive approach we discussed earlier, and remember that it's okay to ask for support and accommodation when you're dealing with personal challenges.

In our next session, we can review your experiences with the homework and discuss any insights or challenges that came up. We can also explore how these skills can support you in managing your stress and anxiety as you navigate your academic responsibilities and personal growth.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'll definitely work on those exercises and try to have a conversation with one of my professors. I'm feeling a bit more confident about it now.

I'm looking forward to our next session and discussing how it goes. I think these skills will really help me manage my stress better.

Therapist: As we wrap up our session today, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in managing your guilt around breaks and practicing self-care. It's been great to see you implementing the strategies we've discussed and using your coping cards and thought records. 

I also want to encourage you to continue working on communicating your needs assertively with your professors. It's a skill that takes practice, but it can help you navigate your academic responsibilities and personal challenges with more confidence.

For homework, I'd like you to:
1. Practice the progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing exercises daily, especially when you feel stressed or overwhelmed.
2. Complete a thought record each day, focusing on any anxious or guilty thoughts that come up, and practice reframing them in a more balanced way.
3. Have at least one conversation with a professor about your academic needs, using the assertive approach we discussed earlier.

In our next session, we can review your experiences with the homework and discuss any insights or challenges that came up. We can also explore how these skills can support you in managing your stress and anxiety as you navigate your academic responsibilities and personal growth.

Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks along the way. What matters most is that you keep practicing and learning from your experiences.

Thank you for your hard work and openness in today's session, Naomi. I look forward to continuing our work together.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your encouragement and support. I'll make sure to do the homework and practice those skills. I'm looking forward to our next session and discussing how it goes.

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi. I'm here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns between now and our next session, don't hesitate to reach out.

Take care, and I'll see you soon.
