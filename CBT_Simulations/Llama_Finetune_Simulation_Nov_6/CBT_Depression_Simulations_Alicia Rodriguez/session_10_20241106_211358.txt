Therapist: Welcome back, Alicia. It's great to see you again for our 10th session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, as an AI, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and feelings openly.

Patient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I appreciate the transparency. So, how should we start today? I've been trying to stick to the homework, but it's been tough.

Therapist: That's understandable, Alicia. We can review your progress with the homework and discuss any challenges you faced. Perhaps we can also explore how your thoughts and feelings have been impacting your work and personal life since our last session. What do you think would be most helpful to focus on today?

Patient: I think reviewing the homework would be a good start. I did try to leave the office by 7 PM, but there were a few days where I ended up staying later. I also managed to go salsa dancing once, which felt good, but I haven't been able to read much. The work pressure has been intense, and I find myself doubting my abilities again.

Therapist: It's great that you were able to leave the office at a reasonable time and make time for a hobby. I'm sorry to hear that you've been struggling with reading and that work pressure has been challenging. We can definitely explore how your thoughts and feelings have been impacted by these experiences.
Before we dive deeper, let's set an agenda for today's session. We can start with a check-in on your progress with the homework and then move on to discussing the challenges you've faced at work and in your personal life. We can also review the techniques we've introduced so far and see if any adjustments need to be made. What are your thoughts on this plan?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I'm ready to dive in whenever you are.

Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your homework from our last session. You mentioned that you were able to leave the office by 7 PM on some days and even went salsa dancing. That's great! I'm curious to know how you felt after engaging in these activities and if they had any impact on your overall well-being.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. Leaving the office by 7 PM felt good, but I also felt guilty for not staying longer. Salsa dancing was a nice break, and it helped me relax a bit. It was the first time I'd done something purely for fun in a while. I did notice that I felt less stressed afterward, but the feeling didn't last long.

Therapist: It's common to feel a mix of emotions when making changes like this. I'm glad you noticed that salsa dancing helped you relax and felt less stressed temporarily. This is a good indication that engaging in enjoyable activities can have a positive impact on your well-being. It's also important to recognize and accept the feelings of guilt, and we can work on addressing that in our sessions.

Patient: Yeah, the guilt is something I need to work on. It's like I'm programmed to feel like I'm not doing enough, even when I am. I guess that's part of the perfectionism you mentioned before. How do we tackle that?

Therapist: You're right, perfectionism plays a significant role in the guilt you're experiencing. One way we can address it is by challenging those perfectionistic thoughts and beliefs using the evidence-based thinking technique we've discussed. For example, you could examine the evidence that leaving the office at 7 PM or taking time for salsa dancing is actually detrimental to your work performance.

Patient: I see what you mean. I guess I can look at the days I left early and see if there was any negative impact on my work. But what if I find that there was no negative impact? How do I convince myself that it's okay to leave early?

Therapist: That's an excellent question, Alicia. We can use the evidence-based thinking technique to gather evidence that supports the idea that it's okay to leave at a reasonable time and take care of yourself. When we have enough evidence to support a new, more balanced thought, it becomes easier to believe and accept it.
