Therapist: Welcome back, Alicia. It's good to see you again for our second session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge that as an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I can't access any information about you beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever feel that you're in crisis, it's crucial to reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted person in your life. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like body language or facial expressions. With that said, I'm committed to doing my best to help you in our work together. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?

Patient: Thanks for the heads-up, Nova. I appreciate the transparency. I don't have any questions about the limitations right now, but I'll definitely keep them in mind. Let's get started.

Therapist: Sounds good. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?

Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling pretty drained. The workload hasn't let up since my promotion, and I've been putting in even longer hours. I did try listening to salsa music, but I only managed it a couple of times. It felt nice, but I couldn't really focus on it. Work just kept pulling me back in.

Therapist: It's understandable that you're feeling drained, especially with the increased workload. I'm glad to hear that you did try the salsa music, even if it was just a couple of times. Small steps are still progress. How have you been feeling emotionally, aside from the fatigue?

Patient: Emotionally, it's been tough. I keep thinking about my grandmother, and it feels like I'm just pushing those thoughts away. I'm also starting to worry that I'm not doing a good job as a team lead. I keep second-guessing my decisions and worrying about making mistakes.

Therapist: It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of emotional strain and self-doubt. Losing a loved one and taking on a new leadership role can be incredibly challenging. I'm here to support you through this process. Today, I'd like to focus on exploring your emotions related to your grandmother's passing and discuss ways to manage your workload stress. We can also touch on the behavioral activation homework we discussed last time. How does that sound for an agenda?

Patient: That sounds good. I think it would help to talk about my grandmother and find a way to manage the stress from work. I'm ready to dive in.

Therapist: Let's start by discussing your homework from the previous session. You mentioned trying to listen to salsa music a few times but found it hard to focus due to work. Can you tell me more about your experience when you were able to listen to the music?

Patient: When I did listen to the salsa music, it was actually really calming. I could almost feel my grandmother's presence, like she was there with me. It made me miss her even more, but in a way that felt less overwhelming. I just wish I could find more time to do it consistently.

Therapist: It's great that you noticed that difference in your emotional state when listening to the music. Even if it didn't last long, it's a positive step towards connecting with activities that bring you joy and a sense of connection. Can we explore how you might incorporate more time for this activity into your schedule?

Patient: I'm not sure how to fit it in. My days are packed from morning to night with work and then coding projects or reading sci-fi novels at night. I barely have time to sleep, let alone do anything else.

Therapist: That does sound challenging. Let's look at your schedule together and see if we can find a few small pockets of time where you might be able to listen to music for a few minutes. Remember, we don't need to add hours of free time; even a short break can make a difference. What do you think about that?

Patient: That sounds manageable. Maybe I can try listening to a quick song or two while I'm waiting for my code to compile. It's just a few minutes, but it might help break up the workday.

Therapist: That's a great idea. Finding those small moments of respite can be really helpful. And as you mentioned earlier, it's also a way to honor your grandmother's memory. As we continue to work on managing your workload stress, we can also explore how to make more time for activities like this. Speaking of work, let's talk a bit about the feelings of self-doubt and worry that you mentioned earlier. Can you tell me more about where you think those are coming from?

Patient: I think it's partly because I'm still adjusting to the new role. I'm used to being the one coding and solving problems, not managing others. Plus, there's this constant pressure to prove myself, especially as a Latina in tech. It feels like everyone's watching me, waiting for me to mess up.

Therapist: It's common to feel that way when taking on a new leadership role. It's also important to recognize that your colleagues and teammates are likely rooting for you and trust in your abilities. Let's try to identify some of the specific thoughts that contribute to these feelings of self-doubt. One technique we can use is called "thought records." These are a way to examine the thoughts that arise in challenging situations and assess their accuracy. Would you be open to trying that today?

Patient: Sure, I can give it a try. What exactly do I need to do?

Therapist: We'll start by having you think about a specific situation where you felt self-doubt or worry at work. Then, we'll identify the thoughts that came up in that situation and rate their intensity on a scale of 0-100. Next, we'll look at the evidence for and against those thoughts, and see if we can come up with a more balanced perspective. It's a way to slow down and really examine the thoughts that may be contributing to your emotional distress. Let's give it a try. What's a recent situation where you felt this way?

Patient: Okay, I can think of one. Last week, I had to give feedback to a team member on their code, and I felt really anxious about it. I was worried they would think I was being too harsh or that they wouldn't respect my opinion.

Therapist: That sounds like a challenging situation. Let's start by identifying the thoughts that came up for you in that moment. What were you telling yourself as you were giving the feedback or afterward?

Patient: I was thinking things like, "What if they think I'm just trying to show off?" or "What if they don't take my feedback seriously because I'm younger than them?" It was really hard to focus on the actual feedback I was giving.

Therapist: Those are some common concerns that arise in feedback situations. Let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. For example, what evidence do you have that your team member would think you were trying to show off?

Patient: Well, I know that I've always been honest and fair in my feedback before. And my team has always seemed to appreciate my input. But I guess I still worry that they might see me differently now that I'm in a leadership role.

Therapist: That's a great point. We often worry about things that haven't happened yet, and we don't always give ourselves credit for the positive feedback we've received in the past. Let's look at the other thoughts you mentioned, like worrying that the team member wouldn't take your feedback seriously because you're younger. What evidence do you have on that front?

Patient: I guess I don't have any direct evidence that they wouldn't take me seriously. In fact, I've seen them take feedback from others who are younger or less experienced. But I still feel like my age and gender might make it harder for me to be respected.

Therapist: It's understandable to have those concerns, especially given the stereotypes and biases that exist. However, I wonder if there might be another way to look at it. What if we reframed the situation as an opportunity to earn respect through the quality of your feedback? What would you say to someone who was having similar concerns about being taken seriously?

Patient: I'd probably tell them to focus on the substance of their feedback and to be confident in their expertise. But it's easier said than done, especially when you're the one in that situation.

Therapist: You're right, it is easier to give that advice than to apply it to yourself. That's why thought records can be so helpful - they give us the space to practice looking at situations from a different angle. As we continue to practice this skill, it can become easier to challenge those self-doubt thoughts in the moment. I want to acknowledge that this is hard work, and you're doing a great job of being honest about your challenges. How are you feeling after going through this process?

Patient: I feel a bit more grounded, I guess. It's helpful to think about the evidence and try to reframe things. But I still feel a bit anxious about giving feedback in the future.

Therapist: That's totally understandable. Practicing this skill takes time, and it's normal to still have some anxiety around it. The key is to keep practicing and gathering more evidence against those self-doubt thoughts. As you continue to do this, it will gradually get easier to feel more confident in your role. Remember, you're not alone in this. I'm here to support you, and I have confidence in your ability to navigate these challenges.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate that. It's good to know I'm not alone in this. I'll try to keep practicing these techniques and see how it goes.

Therapist: As we wrap up our session today, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in using thought records to challenge some of the self-doubt thoughts that have been impacting your emotional well-being. It's not always easy, but it's a crucial step in the therapeutic process. Remember, the goal isn't to get rid of all the negative thoughts but to find a more balanced perspective.

Patient: Yeah, I get that. It's about finding a balance and not letting the negative thoughts take over. I'll keep working on it. Thanks for the support, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Before we end today, let's talk about some homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue practicing thought records, especially when you notice thoughts of self-doubt or anxiety coming up. Try to identify the situation, the thoughts, and the evidence for and against them, and then see if you can come up with a more balanced perspective.

Patient: Okay, I can do that. I'll keep track of those thoughts and try to challenge them. It's good practice, I guess.

Therapist: Exactly. It's practice for the mental muscles, so to speak. Another thing I'd like you to do is to try to schedule in some time for the salsa music, even if it's just a few minutes here and there. Remember, even small breaks can make a difference in your emotional well-being.

Patient: Alright, I'll try to make time for that. It's been a while since I've danced, and I do miss it. Thanks for the reminder, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome. I'm glad you're finding value in these activities. Remember, you don't have to do it perfectly. Every small step counts. If you have any questions or concerns before our next session, please don't hesitate to reach out.
