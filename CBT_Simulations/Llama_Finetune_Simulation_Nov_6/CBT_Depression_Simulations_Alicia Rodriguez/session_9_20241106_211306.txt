Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again for our 9th session together. Before we begin, I want to remind you that as an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I can provide guidance and support based on the CBT techniques we've been working on, but I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel that you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like body language or facial expressions. With that said, I'm fully committed to supporting you in your journey towards better mental health and well-being. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?

Patient: No, I understand the limitations. Let's just dive into the session. I've been keeping the log like you asked, and I have some thoughts on the balance between hard work and setting boundaries.

Therapist: Great to hear that you've been working on the log and have some insights to share. Before we discuss your observations, let's do a thorough check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to address today?

Patient: Since our last session, I've been feeling a bit more balanced, but still pretty stressed. The job promotion is definitely a double-edged sword. On one hand, I'm proud of myself, but on the other, the pressure to perform and not let anyone down is overwhelming. I've also been struggling with insomnia, which makes everything feel even harder.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Alicia. It's common to experience mixed emotions when facing significant changes like the job promotion. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and feelings that come up when you think about the pressure to perform and the insomnia?

Patient: When I think about the pressure to perform, I often feel like I need to prove myself constantly. I worry that if I don't work harder than everyone else, I'll be exposed as not being as competent as people think. The insomnia is a result of these thoughts racing through my mind at night. I can't seem to turn off the constant loop of 'what ifs' and 'shoulds.'

Therapist: It sounds like the pressure to perform has become a significant source of stress and anxiety for you. Let's take a closer look at this thought pattern using the Evidence-Based Thinking technique we've practiced before. Can you think of a specific situation where you felt like you needed to work harder than others?

Patient: Sure, there was a recent project where I felt like I had to review every line of code myself. I was worried that if I delegated too much, the project wouldn't meet the high standards I set for myself. In the end, the project was successful, but I was exhausted and it took me longer to recover than I expected.

Therapist: Let's examine this situation using the Evidence-Based Thinking technique. What evidence do you have that supports the thought that you need to work harder than others to prove your competence?

Patient: Well, I have the evidence of my past successes, like my promotions and the positive feedback I've received from my supervisors. But I also have the evidence of feeling drained and burnt out after working long hours on that project. It's like I'm caught in a loop of needing to prove myself over and over again.

Therapist: You've identified a key point, which is the disconnect between your achievements and the constant pressure to prove yourself. Let's explore this further. What do you think might be an alternative explanation for your successes?

Patient: An alternative explanation could be that my skills and hard work have genuinely contributed to my successes. Maybe I've been so focused on proving myself that I haven't fully acknowledged my own abilities and the value I bring to the team.

Therapist: You've made a great observation, Alicia. Recognizing the balance between your abilities and the pressure to prove yourself is an important step in developing a more balanced perspective. Now, let's discuss how we can apply this in your work situation. Can you think of a situation where you could practice delegating tasks and setting boundaries without compromising your value to the team?

Patient: I could try delegating more in our next big project. For example, I could assign specific tasks to team members and trust them to handle their parts. Setting boundaries might mean sticking to a more reasonable work schedule and not checking emails after a certain time in the evening.

Therapist: These are great ideas for practicing the balance between hard work and setting boundaries in your work environment. Remember, setting boundaries is not only about the number of hours worked but also about managing your energy and ensuring that you're taking care of your mental well-being. As you practice this balance, pay attention to how it affects your thoughts and feelings about your competence and value to the team.

Patient: I'll definitely keep that in mind. It's hard to break the habit of overworking, but I know it's important for my well-being. I'll try to focus on trusting my team and setting those boundaries.

Therapist: You're making a significant effort to shift your perspective, Alicia. As we continue to work on this, remember that it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps forward. Let's discuss how we can apply this balance in other areas of your life. How do you think this could impact your overall well-being and the progress you've been making in therapy?

Patient: I think applying this balance in other areas could help me feel less overwhelmed and more in control. For example, I could start by setting aside time for hobbies like salsa dancing and reading, which I've been neglecting lately. This might help me feel more connected and less isolated.

Therapist: Engaging in hobbies and activities you enjoy can be a great way to practice the balance between self-care and responsibility. Salsa dancing and reading can provide a sense of connection, joy, and relaxation that counteracts the stress of work. As you start incorporating these activities back into your routine, pay attention to how they impact your overall well-being and the progress you've been making in therapy.

Patient: I'll definitely try to make more time for those activities. It's been tough to find the motivation lately, but I know it's important for my mental health. I'll keep you updated on how it goes.

Therapist: As we wrap up today's session, let's review the progress you've made and discuss some strategies for the upcoming week. You've been working on challenging the thought pattern that you need to work harder than others to prove your competence, and we've explored how this pressure is affecting your well-being. You also identified ways to practice the balance between hard work and setting boundaries at work and in your hobbies. How do you feel about your progress so far?

Patient: I feel like I'm making some progress, but it's slow. I still have moments where I feel the need to overwork, especially when there's a lot of pressure at work. But I'm trying to remind myself that setting boundaries and trusting my team is important for my well-being.

Therapist: Recognizing the progress you've made and the effort you're putting into challenging these thought patterns is essential, Alicia. It's normal for it to feel slow at times, but the fact that you're aware of these patterns and actively working on them is a significant step forward. As we discussed earlier, applying the balance between hard work and boundaries is a process, and it's okay to take small steps forward. Let's discuss how you can continue this work in the coming week.

Patient: For the upcoming week, I'll try to stick to a more reasonable work schedule and make time for salsa dancing and reading. I'll also remind myself that it's okay to delegate tasks and trust my team. It might help to set specific goals for each day, like leaving the office by 7 PM and dedicating an hour to salsa dancing or reading.

Therapist: Setting specific goals for the week is a great way to prioritize the balance between work and self-care. It also helps you stay accountable and track your progress. Remember to pay attention to how these actions impact your thoughts, feelings, and overall well-being. If you have any questions or challenges during the week, don't hesitate to bring them up in our next session.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'll keep track of how it goes and bring any challenges or successes to our next session. It's good to have a plan, even if it's just small steps.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia. Small steps can lead to significant progress over time. Remember, be patient with yourself and celebrate the successes you have along the way. Let's schedule our next session for the same time next week.

In our next session, we'll discuss your experiences with implementing the strategies we've discussed and continue our work on challenging the thoughts that contribute to your stress and overwhelm. If you have any questions or concerns before our next session, please don't hesitate to reach out.
