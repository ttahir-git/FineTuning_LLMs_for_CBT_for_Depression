Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for our 9th session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't observe or interpret non-verbal cues. However, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for checking in. I've been okay, I guess. Still juggling a lot, but I've been trying to stick to that schedule we talked about. It's helping a bit, but I still find myself getting overwhelmed, especially with my mom's condition. It's tough seeing her like this. How about you? Any new insights or exercises you want to dive into today?

Therapist: I appreciate you sharing, Marcus. It's great to hear that the schedule has been helping, even if it's not completely solving the challenges. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed with the caregiving responsibilities. Let's make sure to discuss that further today. For our agenda, I'd like to review your homework and progress with reframing "should" statements, discuss the caregiving stress and explore how we can apply CBT techniques to manage it, and also touch on your relationship with your family and how that's been going. How does that sound to you?

Patient: That sounds good, Nova. I've been working on those "should" statements, and it's been interesting. I've started to notice how often I tell myself I "should" be doing more, especially with my mom and my kids. It's been a bit of a mind shift to think about what I "want" to do instead. As for my family, it's been a mixed bag. Jamal and Aisha are doing okay, but I feel like I'm not spending enough quality time with them. And with my mom, it's just... emotionally draining. I'm trying to be there for her, but it's hard to see her slipping away. Let's dive into those topics, and maybe we can find some ways to make things a bit easier.

Therapist: You've been doing some great work, Marcus, recognizing those "should" statements and trying to shift your perspective. It's a powerful insight, and it takes practice to keep up with it. I'm glad to hear that the homework has been fruitful for you. Regarding your family, it's understandable to feel pulled in different directions. Balancing caregiving, work, and personal life can be challenging, especially with the emotional toll of seeing your mom's condition. Let's start by exploring how you've been feeling with this new burden. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing emotionally?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's been tough, honestly. I feel a lot of guilt, like I'm not doing enough for my mom. I know I can't be there 24/7, but it feels like I'm failing her. And then there's the worry about my kids. I want to be there for them, but I'm often so exhausted from everything else that I end up snapping at them or not being as present as I want to be. It's like I'm constantly juggling, and something always ends up falling. I guess I'm just feeling a lot of stress and frustration, and it's hard to see a way out.

Therapist: It's completely understandable to feel that way, Marcus. Being a caregiver is a difficult role, and it's common to experience a range of emotions, including guilt, frustration, and stress. It's important to remember that you're doing the best you can, even if it doesn't always feel like it. Let's break down what's been happening and see if we can find some ways to manage these feelings. When you're with your mom or kids, what thoughts run through your mind? What triggers that frustration and stress?

Patient: When I'm with my mom, I often think about how much she's changed and how helpless I feel. I keep thinking, "I should be doing more," or "I should have noticed this sooner." With my kids, it's usually when they need something and I'm already stretched thin. I start thinking, "I should be able to handle this," or "I should be more patient." It's like I'm constantly battling these "should" statements in my head, and it just builds up until I snap. I know it's not fair to them, but I can't seem to stop it.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Marcus. It's clear that these thoughts are causing a lot of distress for you. I want to help you challenge these "should" statements, as they seem to be playing a big role in your emotional state. Remember how we've been working on reframing them into "want" statements? For example, instead of saying "I should be doing more for my mom," you could say, "I want to do my best for my mom, even if it's not everything." How does that sound to you?

Patient: That makes sense, Nova. It's a different way of looking at things. Instead of feeling like I'm failing, it's more about doing what I can and accepting that it's enough. I guess it's about giving myself a break, right? But it's hard to switch gears like that. How do I start making that change?

Therapist: Exactly, Marcus. It's about giving yourself some grace and recognizing that what you're doing is already enough, even if it feels small sometimes. Challenging these long-standing thought patterns takes practice, and it's not always easy. One way to start is by noticing when these "should" statements come up, taking a deep breath, and then asking yourself, "Is this thought helpful?" or "What would a friend say in this situation?" Another strategy is to create a list of things you can do for your mom and kids, even if they're small things. This can help you feel more in control and less overwhelmed. We can work on this together, and I'll help you come up with some specific examples. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I think breaking it down into smaller steps and having a list of things I can do will help. It's easy to get lost in the big picture and feel like I'm not doing enough. But if I focus on what I can manage, it might make things a bit more manageable. Let's work on that list and see how it goes.

Therapist: Great idea, Marcus. Let's start with your mom. What are some small things you can do for her, even if it's not all the care you'd like to provide?

Patient: For my mom, I can make sure she has her favorite meals, like her sweet potato pie. I can also set up a routine for her medications and make sure she has someone to check in on her during the day. It's not everything, but it's something.

Therapist: That's a great start, Marcus. You're recognizing that every effort counts, even if it seems small. It's about showing care in simple ways, and being consistent. What about your kids? How can you make time for them?

Patient: With my kids, I can set aside specific times just for them, like a Saturday morning breakfast or an evening walk. I can also make sure to listen to them when they talk, even if it's just for a few minutes before I get back to work. It's about being present, even if it's not for long periods.

Therapist: Those are wonderful ideas, Marcus. Showing your kids that you care, even in small doses, can go a long way in maintaining that connection. It's also about making the most of the time you do have with them, and being fully present when you're with them. As we continue to work on challenging those "should" statements, remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time. Progress isn't always linear, but every small effort counts.

As we wrap up today's session, let's revisit the homework. I'd like you to continue practicing reframing those "should" statements into "want" statements, and also create a list of ways you can support your mom and kids, even if they're small things. We'll review your list together in our next session and see how we can build on it. Do you have any questions or concerns before we end today?

Patient: No questions right now, Nova. I'll work on that list and try to focus on what I can do, not what I think I should be doing. Thanks for the help today. I'll see you next time.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. I'm glad we were able to work through this together today. Remember, challenging these thought patterns takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Let's review your homework from today's session. Were you able to create a list of ways you can support your mom and kids, even if they're small things?

Patient: Yes, I started the list. For my mom, I wrote down things like making her favorite meals, setting up her medication routine, and arranging for someone to check in on her during the day. For my kids, I listed specific times for them, like Saturday morning breakfast and evening walks, and making sure to listen to them when they talk. It's a good start, but I'm sure I can add more as I think of them.

Therapist: That's a great start, Marcus. You've identified specific ways to show your mom and kids that you care, even if it's in small doses. Remember, it's not about doing everything perfectly, but rather about making consistent efforts to be there for them. How did you find the process of creating this list? Did it bring up any challenges or insights?

Patient: The process was helpful, but it also made me realize how much I need to balance. I feel like I'm juggling a lot, and sometimes it's hard to see where I can fit in more without feeling overwhelmed. But seeing it written down makes it a bit clearer. I guess it's about prioritizing and making small, consistent efforts rather than trying to do everything at once.

Therapist: Exactly, Marcus. It's about finding that balance and being kind to yourself in the process. Remember, you can't do everything perfectly all the time, and that's okay. The fact that you're making an effort to be there for your mom and kids is already a great start. As we continue to work on challenging those "should" statements, I want you to remember that progress isn't always linear. There may be times when you feel like you're not doing enough, but that's normal. The key is to keep moving forward, one step at a time, and celebrate the small victories along the way.

Speaking of small victories, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in our sessions so far. You've been able to recognize and reframe those "should" statements, which is a big accomplishment. You've also been open to trying new strategies, like creating a schedule and setting boundaries. These steps may seem small, but they're actually significant changes that can lead to big improvements in your overall well-being.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's been a journey, but I'm starting to see that small steps can add up. I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll keep working on it and see you next time.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that, Marcus. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, progress isn't always easy, but it's always worth it. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you at our next session.
