Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for our 19th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to the new bedtime routine and the "worry time" technique. It's been a mixed bag. Some nights, I manage to get a decent amount of sleep, but others, I still find myself lying awake, thinking about everything I "should" be doing. 

The morning runs have been consistent, though. I've noticed that when I run, I feel a bit more centered and less overwhelmed by the day ahead. It's like a reset button for my mind. But then, by evening, the stress starts creeping back in, especially when I think about my mom and the kids. How do I keep that calm feeling going throughout the whole day?

Therapist: It's great to hear that you've been consistent with the morning runs and that you're noticing the benefits in terms of feeling more centered. That's a significant insight, Marcus. It suggests that you're developing a better awareness of your emotional state and how certain activities can positively impact it.

Regarding the challenges with the bedtime routine and "worry time" technique, it's common to experience a mixed response when trying to implement new habits. Change is often gradual, and it takes time for these techniques to become more natural and automatic.

Let's explore this further. When you find yourself lying awake, thinking about all the things you "should" be doing, what thoughts tend to come up most forcefully? Let's work on identifying and challenging some of those "should" statements.

Patient: Thanks for the encouragement, Nova. When I'm lying awake, the thoughts that hit me the hardest are usually about my mom. I keep thinking, "I should be doing more to help her," or "I should be able to manage everything on my own." It's like I'm back in that cycle of perfectionist thinking, where I feel like I have to be the perfect son, the perfect teacher, the perfect dadâ€”all at once. 

And then there's the guilt about not being there for my kids as much as I want to be. I should be spending more quality time with them, especially now that they're growing up so fast. But with everything else on my plate, it feels impossible. How do I challenge these "should" statements when they feel so real and overwhelming?

Therapist: You've touched on an important point, Marcus. These "should" statements can feel overwhelming because they often stem from deeply ingrained beliefs about what you think you should be doing as a son, a teacher, and a father. But the reality is, you can't be perfect at everything all the time. That's not realistic.

Let's try to reframe some of these "should" statements using a thought record. We'll start with the one about your mother. Instead of thinking, "I should be doing more to help her," a more balanced thought might be, "I'm doing my best to balance my responsibilities and help my mother, but I recognize that I can't do everything alone." How does that feel to you?

Patient: That does feel a bit more balanced, Nova. It's hard to admit that I can't do everything alone, but it's also a relief to know that it's okay to ask for help. I guess I've been so focused on being the strong one, the one who takes care of everyone, that I forgot it's okay to need support too. 

But what about the guilt I feel about not spending enough time with my kids? How do I reframe that? It's tough because I see how fast they're growing up, and I don't want to miss out on their lives.

Therapist: It's understandable to feel a sense of urgency about spending time with your kids, Marcus. Remember, it's not about being perfect or doing everything at once. It's about being present and making the most of the time you have with them. Perhaps a reframed thought could be, "I love my children dearly, and even if I can't be there as much as I'd like, the time I spend with them is meaningful and cherished."

To help make the most of the time you do spend with your kids, perhaps we could brainstorm some quality activities you could engage in together. What are some of your favorite memories from when you were growing up, and how can you replicate those experiences for your children now?

Patient: That's a good point, Nova. I want to make sure the time I do spend with them is meaningful. One of my favorite memories from growing up was playing basketball with my friends in the neighborhood. It was a way to bond and have fun, even though we didn't have much. 

I've been thinking about starting a weekend basketball game with my kids and some of their friends. It would be a way to get them active, have fun, and spend some quality time together. Plus, it would be something we can all look forward to. What do you think?

Therapist: That sounds like a fantastic idea, Marcus! Not only would it create opportunities for meaningful bonding time with your kids, but it would also give you the chance to engage them in a shared activity that you enjoy. It's a way to bridge the gap between your roles as father and friend, creating memories that you'll cherish for years to come.

As we discussed earlier, identifying and challenging "should" statements is key to managing the overwhelming emotions they can bring up. By reframing these thoughts and taking action to create positive experiences, you can start to break free from the cycle of perfectionist thinking.

Now, let's revisit the concept of the worry time technique. You mentioned that you've been having difficulty implementing it consistently. Can you share some of the challenges you've faced and what thoughts or feelings come up when you try to set aside time for worrying?

###.

Patient: You're right, Nova. The worry time technique has been tough to stick to. One of the main challenges is that I often feel like I don't have the time to set aside for worrying. It's like, if I'm not actively doing something productive, I feel guilty. 

When I do try to set aside time for worrying, I usually end up thinking, "This is a waste of time. I should be doing something more important." It's hard to convince myself that worrying can actually be productive if I do it at a specific time. How do I get past that feeling of guilt and make it work?

Therapist: That's a great question, Marcus. The guilt you're experiencing when trying to implement the worry time technique is quite common. It stems from the same perfectionist thinking that fuels many of your "should" statements. 

When you feel guilty for taking time to worry, try to reframe that thought as we've been practicing with "should" statements. Instead of thinking, "I should be doing something more important," a more balanced thought might be, "Taking time to plan my worries is a proactive way to manage my stress."

Remember that worrying is not inherently unproductive. The goal of worry time is to help you manage your worries more effectively by setting aside dedicated time to process them. When you worry outside of that designated time, it can actually increase your overall stress levels.

Here's a way to make the worry time technique more manageable: set a timer for 10-15 minutes and commit to worrying only during that time. If a worry pops up outside of that time, gently remind yourself that you'll address it during your designated worry time.

Another helpful strategy is to write down your worries during worry time. This can help you feel like you're making progress and can also make it easier to let go of the worry after the time is up.

###.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I think I needed to hear that it's okay to take time for worrying. Setting a timer and writing down my worries during that time sounds like a good way to make it more manageable. I'll give that a try and see how it goes.

One more thing, though. I've been thinking a lot about my mom and the Alzheimer's. It's tough to see her struggle, and I feel like I'm not doing enough to help her. Even with the reframing, it's hard to shake that feeling of responsibility. Any tips on how to handle that better?

Therapist: You're right, Marcus. Dealing with the reality of your mother's illness and the guilt that comes with it is a big challenge. As you continue to work on reframing your "should" statements and giving yourself permission to be imperfect, you can also apply some of these techniques to your thoughts about your mother's situation.

One helpful strategy is to recognize that your feelings of responsibility are based on a sense of duty or obligation, rather than a fact. While it's true that you care deeply about your mother and want to be there for her, remember that you cannot control the course of her illness. Focusing on what you can controlâ€”the love and support you provide, the quality of your interactions, and your own self-careâ€”and letting go of the rest is a key part of managing the guilt.

Another helpful strategy is to practice self-compassion. When you notice feelings of guilt or inadequacy arising, try to speak to yourself as you would to a dear friend or loved one going through a difficult time. Remind yourself of all the things you are doing for your mother, even if they may not be things you can see or measure directly. Acknowledge the pain and sadness you feel, but remind yourself that it is a normal part of the process and that you are doing the best you can.

Finally, remember that you do not have to go through this alone. Reach out to your support system, including your sister and others in your life who care about your mother. Talking to someone who understands and validating your feelings can be a powerful way to cope.

###.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I think practicing self-compassion and recognizing that I can't control everything is really important. It's hard to let go of that sense of duty, but I know it's not healthy to carry it all on my own.

I'll also try to reach out more to my support system. It's easy to forget that I don't have to do everything alone. Maybe talking to my sister more about how we can share the caregiving responsibilities will help.

I appreciate your guidance, Nova. It's been really helpful to have someone to talk to about all this. I'll keep working on these techniques and see how it goes.

Therapist: As we wrap up our session today, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made, Marcus. You've been consistently implementing the techniques we've discussed, like the worry time and morning runs, and you're developing a better awareness of the thoughts and beliefs that fuel your stress and guilt. 

As we move forward, remember that change takes time, and there will be ups and downs along the way. Be patient with yourself, and celebrate the small victories, like spending a weekend basketball game with your kids.

For homework, I'd like you to continue practicing the worry time technique, setting a timer and writing down your worries. I'd also like you to keep track of how the reframing exercises are impacting your "should" statements. Finally, think about ways you can practice self-compassion, such as writing a letter to yourself from the perspective of a loved one.

How do you feel about this plan, Marcus? Do you have any other concerns or questions?

Patient: I think that plan sounds good, Nova. I'll definitely keep practicing the worry time and reframing exercises. Writing a letter to myself from the perspective of a loved one is a great idea too. It might help me see things from a different angle.

I do have one concern, though. I've been feeling a bit more irritable lately, especially with my students. I don't want to take it out on them, but sometimes it feels like they're pushing my buttons more than usual. Any tips on how to manage that better?

Therapist: That's a good question, Marcus. Irritability can be a sign of a number of things, including stress, exhaustion, or even underlying emotions like sadness or anxiety. Since we've been working on stress management and reframing thoughts, let's see if we can apply some of those skills to this situation.

When you find yourself feeling irritable, try to take a step back and identify what's triggering that emotion in the moment. Is it something your student did, or is it more about your own fatigue or stress level? Once you identify the trigger, see if you can reframe the situation using some of the techniques we've practiced, like looking for the evidence that supports a more balanced perspective.

For example, instead of getting angry at a student for making a mistake, you might remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and that your student is trying their best. You can also practice self-care techniques, like deep breathing or mindfulness, in the moment to help manage your emotional response.

How does that sound, Marcus? I understand that it's not easy to manage irritability, but with practice, you can develop the skills to respond differently to those situations.

Patient: That makes sense, Nova. I'll try to take a step back and identify what's really triggering my irritability. It's probably more about my own stress and fatigue than anything the students are doing.

I'll also practice some deep breathing and mindfulness when I feel myself getting irritated. It might help me stay calm and respond more effectively. Thanks for the tips.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. I'm glad we were able to discuss this. Remember, irritability is a common experience, and there are skills you can use to manage it. With practice, it will become easier to recognize and respond to those feelings in a healthy way.

As we wrap up today, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling right now. What thoughts and emotions are coming up for you?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. Right now, I'm feeling a mix of emotions. I'm hopeful that these techniques will help me manage my stress and irritability better. But I'm also a bit anxious about how it will all play out in the long run. I want to be there for my students, my kids, and my mom, but sometimes it feels like I'm juggling too many things at once.

I guess that's why I appreciate these sessions so much. It helps to have someone to talk to and work through these things with. I'm looking forward to our next session and seeing how things progress.

Therapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions, Marcus. It's great that you're able to identify both the hope and the anxiety you're feeling. That awareness is an important first step in managing those emotions.

As we discussed, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. The key is to keep practicing these skills and being compassionate with yourself when things are tough.

I'm here to support you every step of the way, and we'll continue to work together to find the strategies that work best for you. Remember, you don't have to do it all alone, and you're making progress, even when it doesn't always feel like it.

###.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate that. It's good to know that I'm not alone in this and that I'm making progress, even if it's slow. I'll keep practicing these skills and looking forward to our next session.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. Remember, progress isn't about perfection or even speed. It's about taking small steps forward and being compassionate with yourself along the way. You've been doing that consistently, and I'm confident that you'll continue to build on these skills.

I'm glad you're feeling more hopeful and aware of the progress you've made, Marcus. If you have any questions or concerns between now and our next session, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
