Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for our 12th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, as an AI, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever feel that you're in crisis or need immediate assistance, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and emotions openly.

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for the reminder. I appreciate the transparency. Let's dive in. I've been trying to practice self-compassion and use the coping card during my weekends with my mom. It's been a mixed bag. Some moments are better than others, but I'm definitely noticing a difference in how I handle things.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing self-compassion and using the coping card. It's great that you're noticing a difference, even if it's not consistent. Change takes time, and it's normal to have ups and downs. Can you share an example of a moment when you successfully used self-compassion or the coping card?

Patient: Sure, last weekend, I was helping my mom with her medication routine. She was getting frustrated because she couldn't remember the order, and I started to feel overwhelmed and guilty for not being more patient. I remembered to use the coping card, which had a reminder to take deep breaths and remind myself that it's okay to feel this way. It helped me stay calm and not get too caught up in the moment.

Therapist: That's a great example, Marcus. Using the coping card when you were feeling overwhelmed by your mom's frustration is a significant step forward. It shows that you're able to catch yourself in those moments and turn to self-compassionate strategies. Remember, self-compassion is about treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer a good friend.

Patient: Yeah, it's definitely not easy, but I'm trying. I've also been keeping a thought record, like you suggested. It's helping me see patterns in my negative thoughts, especially around feeling guilty for not being able to do more. I'm realizing that a lot of my stress comes from these thoughts that I "should" be doing more.

Therapist: Reframing those "should" thoughts is a powerful step in managing your stress and emotions. It's great that you're recognizing these patterns in your thought record. I'd like to introduce another technique today that can help you further challenge those thoughts and find more balanced perspectives. Before we dive into that, let's take a moment to set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize today?

Patient: I think I'd like to focus on finding more balanced perspectives when it comes to my responsibilities. I often feel like I'm spread too thin, and it's hard to see a way out. If you have any techniques or exercises that could help with that, I'd love to hear them.

Therapist: Let's dive into that today, Marcus. The technique I'd like to introduce is called the "Continuum Technique." It's a way of finding balanced perspectives by examining the extremes of a situation. We'll start by identifying a stressor or responsibility that you're currently dealing with, and then we'll break it down into its opposite extremes. This will help us uncover the core beliefs underlying your thoughts and find a more balanced perspective. Does this sound like something you'd be interested in exploring?

Patient: That sounds interesting. I'm willing to give it a try. Let's start with my responsibilities at school. I often feel like I'm not doing enough for my students, especially with the systemic issues they face. I'll take it from there.

Therapist: Great, let's start by identifying the extremes of your responsibility towards your students and the challenges they face. What's the one extreme end of the spectrum?

Patient: At one extreme, I could feel like I'm completely failing my students. That I'm not doing enough to help them overcome the systemic issues they face, and that my efforts are just a drop in the ocean.

Therapist: And what's the opposite extreme?

Patient: The opposite extreme would be feeling completely detached from my students. Like, not caring at all about their struggles or their futures, just teaching the material and not putting in the extra effort to help them succeed outside the classroom. That's the complete opposite of how I feel now.

Therapist: Now, let's consider the core beliefs that might be underlying these extremes. What might you tell yourself if you were at that extreme of feeling like you're completely failing?

Patient: If I were at that extreme, I might tell myself that I'm not making a difference, that my work is pointless, and that I should just give up because it's too overwhelming.

Therapist: And what might you tell yourself if you were at the opposite extreme, feeling completely detached?

Patient: If I were completely detached, I might tell myself that it's not my problem, that I'm just here to teach the curriculum, and that I shouldn't get involved in their personal struggles.

Therapist: Let's look at the core beliefs you identified: "my work is pointless," "it's not my problem," and "I shouldn't get involved." Do any of these feel familiar or resonant with you?

Patient: Yeah, the "my work is pointless" belief definitely resonates with me. I often feel like no matter how hard I try, it's not enough to really change things for my students.

Therapist: That's a common feeling for teachers who are passionate about making a difference. Let's explore that belief a bit more. What would you say to a good friend who expressed a similar belief?

Patient: I'd tell them that their work is valuable, even if it feels like small steps. Every lesson, every conversation, every after-school program—it all adds up. They're planting seeds that might grow into something bigger later on.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Marcus. You're able to recognize the value in the small steps, and you're able to see a positive outcome, even if it's not immediate. That's the essence of finding a balanced perspective. Now, let's look at the belief "it's not my problem." What would you say to a student who expressed a similar belief?

Patient: I'd tell them that their voice matters, and that they have the power to make a difference, even if it feels small. It's about being part of the solution, not just standing by.

Therapist: Exactly. That's the essence of the Continuum Technique – finding a balanced perspective that takes into account both sides of the belief. It's not about being completely detached or completely overwhelmed, but about finding a place where you can take action and make a difference, even in small ways. How do you feel about applying this technique to other areas of your life, where you feel stretched thin?

Patient: I think it could help, especially with balancing my time between work, family, and caring for my mom. It might help me see that I don't have to do everything at once, but that every little bit I do counts.

Therapist: That's a great point, Marcus. Finding balance isn't about doing everything perfectly, but about acknowledging and appreciating the efforts you do make. As we wrap up our session today, I'd like to assign some homework that will help you practice finding balanced perspectives. First, I'd like you to continue using your coping card and practicing the "should" reframing technique we discussed last session. Second, I'd like you to create a list of your responsibilities and the small steps you can take to make progress in each area. Lastly, I'd like you to try the Continuum Technique whenever you notice yourself getting stuck in extreme thinking. Does this feel manageable for you?

Patient: Yeah, that sounds doable. I'll work on those tasks and see how it goes. Thanks, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. I'm proud of the progress you're making. Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. The important thing is to keep practicing and be kind to yourself along the way. We'll continue to explore these themes in our next session, and I'll check in with you about how it went at our next appointment.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the support. I'll see you next time.

Therapist: See you then, Marcus. Take care.
