Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for our 13th session. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hey, Nova. Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to keep up with the coping card and the "should" reframing technique. It's been a mixed bag, honestly. Some days are better than others. I managed to use the coping card during a tough moment with my mom, which helped a bit. But I still find myself getting overwhelmed, especially with the back-to-school rush at the school and the ongoing care for my mom. How about we dive into that a bit?

Therapist: That sounds like a good plan, Marcus. I'm glad to hear that you've been working on the techniques we discussed and that you had a moment of success with the coping card. It's also important to acknowledge the challenges you're facing, especially with the increased workload and caregiving responsibilities. Let's start by exploring how you've been feeling emotionally and physically. Can you tell me more about the overwhelming moments and how they impact you?

Patient: Sure. Emotionally, I've been feeling a lot of pressure and guilt. I keep thinking I should be doing more for my students, my kids, and my mom. Physically, I've been more tired than usual. My sleep has been off, and I've been stress eating more, especially late at night. It's like I'm juggling too many balls, and I'm afraid one of them is going to drop.

Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way, Marcus. The pressures you're facing are significant, and it's natural to have those "should" thoughts when you feel you're not meeting your own expectations. The exhaustion and changes in eating habits are also valid concerns. Let's break down your schedule and responsibilities to see if there are any areas where we can make adjustments or prioritize tasks. We can also explore how your thoughts might be contributing to the stress and find ways to reframe them. How does that sound for an agenda today?

Patient: That sounds good. I think breaking down my schedule and looking at how my thoughts contribute to the stress could really help. I've been trying to do too much, and it's overwhelming. Maybe if we can find a way to prioritize and simplify things, I can get some of that mental space back.

Therapist: Absolutely, Marcus. Prioritizing and simplifying can make a big difference. Let's start by looking at your list of responsibilities and the steps you've identified for each area. We can then explore your thought patterns and see if there are any "should" statements that might be adding to the stress. As we work through this, remember to be kind to yourself. You're doing the best you can with the resources you have. Let's begin with the list of responsibilities and take it from there.

Patient: Alright, here's a quick breakdown of my main responsibilities:

1. **Teaching and Student Support:**
   - Lesson planning and grading
   - After-school programs and workshops
   - Individual student mentoring

2. **Caregiving for Mom:**
   - Weekly visits and assistance
   - Managing her medication and appointments
   - Emotional support

3. **Co-parenting:**
   - Scheduling visits with the kids
   - Financial responsibilities (alimony, child support)
   - Ensuring their well-being and education

4. **Community Activism:**
   - Organizing community events and meetings
   - Leading youth mentorship programs
   - Advocacy work

5. **Personal Well-being:**
   - Exercise routine
   - Church involvement
   - Self-care (though I often neglect this)

I think the biggest stressors are the teaching and caregiving responsibilities. They both demand a lot of time and emotional energy, and I often feel like I'm not doing enough in either area.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Marcus. I can see how those responsibilities have been weighing on you. Let's start by looking at your teaching responsibilities. Last session, you mentioned the back-to-school rush and the ongoing care for your students. Can you tell me more about the specific challenges you're facing in that area?

Patient: Sure. The back-to-school rush has been intense. I've had to prepare a lot of new lesson plans, and I'm trying to balance that with the individual support some of my students need. Some of them are dealing with personal issues like family problems or gang involvement, and I feel like I should be doing more to help them. I'm also trying to organize after-school programs and workshops, but it's been hard to find the time. I keep thinking I should be able to do it all, but I'm spread too thin.

Therapist: Marcus, you're right to recognize that you're stretched thin. It's a common challenge for teachers who care deeply about their students. Let's break down your responsibilities here. When you think about lesson planning, grading, and individual student support, what are the most essential tasks? What are the non-essentials that might be draining your energy?

Patient: I think the most essential tasks are the lesson planning and the individual student support. Those are the core of my job. The non-essentials might be some of the after-school programs and workshops. I feel like they're important, but they're not as critical as the day-to-day teaching and student support. I've been trying to do too much, and it's taking a toll on me.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Marcus. Recognizing the difference between essential and non-essential tasks is an important step in prioritizing and simplifying your workload. Let's focus on the essentials: lesson planning and individual student support. How can we break these tasks down into smaller, manageable steps? Is there any assistance or delegation that could help lighten your load?

Patient: For lesson planning, I could break it down into smaller chunks, maybe planning a few lessons at a time instead of trying to do it all at once. For individual student support, I could set aside specific times during the day for that, so it doesn't bleed into everything else. As for assistance, I could ask some of the other teachers to help with the after-school programs. They've offered before, but I've been reluctant to take them up on it. Maybe it's time to let go of some of that control and trust them to help out.

Therapist: Those are great ideas, Marcus. Breaking tasks down into smaller steps and setting aside specific times for individual support can make your work feel more manageable. Asking for assistance from other teachers is a big step, but it's one that can help distribute the load and give you more time for self-care. Remember, trusting others and letting go of some control is a process, and it's okay to start small. Are there any specific ways you could ask for help this week, perhaps with the after-school programs or with some of the lesson planning?

Patient: I could start by asking one of the other history teachers to take over one of the after-school workshops this week. It's a smaller step, but it would give me some breathing room. For lesson planning, I could try to plan just two lessons at a time instead of the whole week's worth. It might feel strange at first, but I think it could help me stay focused and less overwhelmed.

Therapist: Those sound like great first steps, Marcus. Starting small and testing out new approaches can help you build momentum and confidence. Remember to communicate your needs and requests clearly with the other teachers. It's possible they'll be happy to help out and appreciate your trust in them. As you take these steps this week, pay attention to how they impact your energy levels and overall stress. We can continue to explore and refine this approach in our next session.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'll give it a try this week and see how it goes. I'll also keep an eye on how it affects my stress levels. I appreciate the support.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. I'm here to support you in whatever ways I can. As we continue to work together, we'll keep exploring how your thoughts, behaviors, and feelings are connected, and find ways to create meaningful change in your life. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories as you move forward.

Patient: I appreciate that, Nova. It's easy to get caught up in the big picture and forget to celebrate the small wins. I'll try to keep that in mind as I go through this week. Thanks for the reminder.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. Recognizing and celebrating the small wins is an important part of the process. It's easy to get lost in the details and forget how far you've come when things get tough. As you continue to prioritize your responsibilities and find ways to ask for support, remember that each small step brings you closer to your goals.

Let's shift gears a bit and explore how your thoughts might be contributing to the stress you're experiencing. We touched on the "should" statements earlier, but let's dive a bit deeper. Can you give me an example of a recent situation where you noticed yourself having a "should" thought?

Patient: Sure, there was a recent parent-teacher conference where I felt like I should have been able to connect better with a parent who was very upset about their child's progress. I kept thinking, "I should be able to handle this better," and it made me feel even more stressed and inadequate.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Marcus. "Should" statements can be quite powerful, and they often fuel feelings of inadequacy and stress. Let's explore this further using the Continuum Technique we discussed before. On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is the extreme of not being able to handle the situation at all and 100 is handling it perfectly, how would you rate your connection with that parent?

Patient: I'd probably rate it around 60. I did manage to listen to the parent's concerns and offer some suggestions for how we could work together to help their child, but I still felt like I could have done more.

Therapist: 60 is a decent rating, Marcus. It means you were able to engage with the parent and offer support, which is important. Now, let's consider the extreme end of 0. What do you think you could have done differently that you feel you "should" have done?

Patient: I guess I felt like I should have been able to immediately calm the parent down and provide a perfect solution. But in reality, that's not always possible, especially when emotions are running high.

Therapist: That's a good insight, Marcus. Recognizing that immediate perfection isn't always possible, especially in emotionally charged situations, can help you find a more balanced perspective. Now, let's consider an alternative point on the continuum. What would be a point between 60 and 0 where you feel you could have handled the situation better?

Patient: Maybe around 40. I could have taken a few more minutes to really understand the parent's concerns before jumping into solutions. I tend to get anxious and want to fix things quickly, but sometimes that can come off as dismissive.

Therapist: That's a great alternative point, Marcus. Taking a few extra minutes to understand the parent's perspective before proposing solutions could have helped the parent feel heard and understood. This is an example of finding a balanced viewpoint between the extremes of not handling the situation at all (0) and doing everything perfectly (100).

As we continue to practice the Continuum Technique, you'll likely find it easier to recognize and reframe "should" statements in the moment. Remember, the goal isn't to judge yourself harshly, but to find a more balanced and compassionate view of your experiences.

Speaking of compassion, how have you been doing with practicing self-compassion this week? Have you been able to use your coping card or practice any of the other techniques we've discussed?

Patient: I've been trying to use my coping card more often, especially when I start feeling overwhelmed. It's been helpful to remind myself to take a step back and breathe. I also went for a run along Lake Michigan yesterday, which always helps clear my head.

Therapist: Those sound like great self-compassion practices, Marcus. Using your coping card and engaging in activities like running can help you regulate your emotions and create space to find more balanced perspectives. Remember, self-compassion isn't about ignoring your challenges, but rather about treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would extend to a good friend.

As we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in finding small ways to prioritize your responsibilities, challenge "should" statements, and practice self-compassion. Remember, change takes time, and every step counts. Before we end, let's discuss your homework for the next week.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the encouragement. For homework, maybe I could focus on using the Continuum Technique in other areas where I tend to be hard on myself, like lesson planning or spending time with my kids. Any specific suggestions on how to do that?

Therapist: Absolutely, Marcus. I have a helpful exercise called "Self-Compassion Break" that you can use when you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or self-critical. Here's how it works:

1. When you notice yourself feeling stressed or beating yourself up, take a moment to breathe and place a hand on your heart.

2. Acknowledge the difficulty you're experiencing, whether it's a situation or an inner dialogue. Be specific, such as "I'm feeling overwhelmed with lesson planning" or "I keep telling myself that I should be a better parent."

3. Remind yourself that this is a common experience for many people, and that everyone struggles at times. Be kind to yourself, just as you would be to a friend, by saying something like "I know this is hard, but I'm doing the best I can" or "I'm human, and I'm allowed to make mistakes."

4. Offer yourself some words of comfort or encouragement, such as "You're doing a great job, Marcus" or "I appreciate your effort and dedication."

How does that sound for homework this week? I think practicing this exercise could help you find more balance and self-compassion in the face of your challenges.

Patient: That sounds really helpful, Nova. I think practicing the Self-Compassion Break will be a good way to keep me grounded and remind myself that I'm doing the best I can. I'll definitely give it a try this week.

Therapist: I'm glad you find it helpful, Marcus. Remember, practicing self-compassion takes time and intention. Be patient with yourself, and know that every small step counts. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or share today?

Patient: I think that's it for today. I'm feeling a bit more hopeful about managing everything, especially with these new techniques. Thanks for your support, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. I'm glad to hear you're feeling more hopeful. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. Be kind to yourself, and know that you're doing the best you can. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Let's plan to meet again next week to discuss how the homework went and continue our work together. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always available to help in whatever way I can.
