Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session (16). I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to the homework you gave me, but it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. I managed to schedule a yoga class for self-care, which felt good, but then I felt guilty afterward because I thought I should have been working on GreenThread instead. My sleep is still pretty erratic—I had a few nights where I managed to fall asleep earlier, but then I had a couple of really bad nights where I was up until 4 AM again. The anxiety about the business and my family's reactions is still there, but I'm trying to use the deep breathing exercises when I feel it creeping up.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been making an effort to incorporate self-care activities and use the deep breathing exercises. It's normal to experience some ups and downs in the process of managing anxiety and depression. I'm here to support you through these challenges. Regarding your sleep issues, let's explore that a bit more. What do you think contributes to those really bad nights where you can't seem to fall asleep?

Patient: I think a lot of it has to do with my mind racing with thoughts about the business and my family. I keep replaying conversations in my head, especially the ones with my parents where they express disappointment in my career change. I also worry about the financial stability of GreenThread—whether I'm making the right decisions, if I'll be able to pay back the loans, and if I'll ever be able to prove to my parents that this was the right choice. It's like I can't turn off my brain, and the more I try to force myself to sleep, the more awake I feel.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Samantha. Racing thoughts and worries can definitely interfere with falling asleep. Let's add sleep hygiene to our agenda for today, along with discussing your feelings of guilt around self-care and exploring ways to manage anxiety related to your business and family concerns. We can also review the homework you've completed so far. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds good, Nova. I'm open to discussing anything that can help me get a better handle on all of this. I've been trying to keep up with the homework, but I could definitely use some guidance on how to make it more effective.

Therapist: Absolutely, we can discuss ways to make the homework more impactful for you. Let's start by reviewing what you've done so far. Which of the homework assignments did you find most helpful, and which ones were more challenging?

Patient: The deep breathing exercises were actually pretty helpful. They helped me calm down when I felt really anxious. The continuum thinking technique was interesting, but I still struggle with feeling guilty about self-care. I haven't been able to stick to the sleep hygiene plan as much as I wanted to, and the boundary-setting with my family is still a work in progress. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around them.

Therapist: It's great that you've found the deep breathing exercises helpful. It's also normal to find some assignments more challenging than others. Let's focus on the areas where you've been struggling and see if we can problem-solve together. When it comes to the sleep hygiene plan, what specific challenges have you faced?

Patient: Well, I think part of the problem is that I'm so used to working late into the night that it's hard to break the habit. I also find it difficult to stop thinking about work and family issues, even when I try to wind down. I've been trying to follow the plan by avoiding screens before bed and doing some relaxation exercises, but it's not always enough to stop my mind from racing.

Therapist: That's a great observation, Samantha. Breaking old habits and shifting your mindset can be difficult. Let's explore some additional strategies for managing racing thoughts before bed. One technique that might be helpful is called "worry time." This involves setting aside a specific time during the day when you allow yourself to focus on worries and write them down. Then, when worries come up during the evening, you remind yourself that you'll deal with them during your scheduled worry time. What do you think about giving that a try?

Patient: That sounds interesting, Nova. I could definitely use a structured way to deal with my worries. How do I set up this "worry time"?

Therapist: Great question! Setting up a worry time can be really effective in managing racing thoughts. First, choose a specific time each day when you'll dedicate 15-20 minutes to write down and process your worries. It's best to pick a time when you know you can focus without interruptions, like after dinner or before bedtime. During this time, use a pen and notebook to write down each worry, along with a brief plan for how you'll address it. This process of getting it out of your head and onto paper can be really helpful. When worries come up at other times, remind yourself that you'll deal with them during your scheduled worry time. It might feel strange at first, but many people find that this technique helps reduce the power worries have over their thoughts. What do you think about giving this a try this week?

Patient: I think that could work for me. I'll try setting aside 15 minutes after dinner to write down my worries and see how it goes. I'll also keep working on the sleep hygiene plan and see if I can make some progress there.

Therapist: That's great, Samantha. Remember to be patient with yourself as you work on implementing these strategies. It's normal to experience some challenges along the way. I'm here to support you through the process. Before we move on to discussing your guilt around self-care and the pressure you're feeling related to your business, let's talk about how we can make the sleep hygiene plan more manageable for you. What specific aspects of the plan do you think would be most helpful to prioritize?

Patient: I think sticking to a consistent bedtime routine would be really helpful. I've been trying to do that, but it's hard when I'm so focused on work. Maybe if I set a specific time to stop working each night, it would be easier to wind down and get ready for bed.

Therapist: That's a great idea. Setting a specific time to stop working each night can help create a clear boundary between work time and relaxation time. This can also help with managing work-life balance. What do you think about trying to establish a consistent bedtime routine and a "no work after a certain time" rule this week?

Patient: I think that could help. I'll try setting a specific time to stop working, maybe 9 PM, and see if that helps me wind down and get ready for bed. I'll also keep using the worry time technique to manage my racing thoughts.

Therapist: Great, Samantha. I think setting those boundaries will be really helpful for managing your sleep and overall stress. Remember to be patient with yourself as you work on implementing these strategies. It's normal to experience some challenges along the way. I'm here to support you through the process. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about the guilt you've been feeling around self-care. Can you tell me more about that?

Patient: Sure, Nova. I feel guilty when I take time for myself, like when I do yoga or meditation. I feel like I should be working on my business instead. It's hard to justify taking time for self-care when there's so much to do and so much pressure to succeed.

Therapist: That's a common struggle for many people, Samantha. It's important to remember that taking time for self-care is essential for your overall well-being and can actually help you be more productive in the long run. The guilt you're feeling is a result of the beliefs you've internalized about self-care being selfish. These beliefs are likely distorted and not based on facts. To challenge these beliefs, I want you to think about the continuum of self-care and responsibility. Self-care is not an all-or-nothing proposition. It's not either/or - either you're being selfish or you're completely dedicated to others. It's a spectrum. Even the most dedicated workaholic takes breaks and eats meals, even if they don't consider those things "self-care." Can you think of any examples of how self-care could fit on this continuum?

Patient: I see what you mean, Nova. Maybe taking a short walk during the day could be considered self-care. It would give me a break from work and help clear my mind. I could also try to incorporate more mindful eating, like taking the time to enjoy my meals instead of just grabbing something quickly.

Therapist: Those are great examples, Samantha. Taking walks, practicing mindful eating, or engaging in hobbies can all be forms of self-care. The key is finding a balance that works for you. As we discussed earlier, working constantly isn't sustainable or productive. By incorporating small self-care practices into your daily routine, you can start to shift your mindset and recognize that taking care of yourself is not selfish—it's necessary. What do you think about trying to add one self-care activity to your daily routine this week?

Patient: I think that's a good idea. I'll try to take a short walk every day during lunch break. It's something I used to do before I started GreenThread, and I remember it helped me feel more focused and energized.

Therapist: That's great, Samantha. Taking a walk during lunch break is a simple way to incorporate self-care into your routine. It's also a great way to set boundaries with yourself and communicate your needs to others. When you take time for self-care, you're letting yourself know that you're important and worthy of care, just like you'd take care of others. As you continue to practice self-care, it's important to challenge the guilt that comes up and remind yourself of its benefits. I encourage you to keep a self-care journal where you write down the ways self-care helps you show up better for others and your business. This can be a powerful tool for reinforcing the benefits of self-care. What do you think about starting a self-care journal this week?
