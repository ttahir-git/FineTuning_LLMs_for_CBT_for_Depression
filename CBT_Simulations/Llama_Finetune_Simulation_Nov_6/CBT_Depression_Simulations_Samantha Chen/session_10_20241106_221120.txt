Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again for our 10th session together. I remember you shared that you found our previous session helpful, especially in managing your sleep issues through progressive muscle relaxation. We also focused on reducing stress related to perfectionism and work-related goals. Before we dive into today's agenda, I want to check in with you. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to be back. Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to the progressive muscle relaxation before bed, and it's been helping a bit with my sleep. I still have nights where my mind races, but it's not as bad as before. 

Work-wise, I've been struggling with setting those smaller, manageable goals. I keep overthinking every detail and end up redoing tasks multiple times. It's frustrating because I feel like I'm not making any real progress. 

Also, my relationship with my parents is still tense. They called last night, and we ended up arguing about my career choices again. It's exhausting.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Samantha. It's common to face challenges when trying to implement new stress-reducing techniques and goal-setting strategies. I'm glad to hear that progressive muscle relaxation has been helpful for your sleep, even if not consistently. 

Regarding work-related goals, perfectionism can be a significant obstacle. Remembering that "good enough" is the goal, not perfect, can help. Perhaps we can spend some time today exploring how to break down those tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.

I hear you about your relationship with your parents. Family dynamics and career choices can be a complex mix. Let's make sure to discuss this further today and explore how we can support you in navigating these challenges.

For today's agenda, what would you prioritize? We could review your progressive muscle relaxation practice, discuss work-related goal-setting, or explore your relationship with your parents. I'm also open to other topics you'd like to focus on.

Patient: I think I'd like to prioritize work-related goal-setting today. It's been a real struggle, and I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels. I need to figure out how to break tasks down better and stop obsessing over every little detail. 

Also, could we touch on my relationship with my parents? I know it's a big topic, but I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around them, and it's draining my energy.

Therapist: Absolutely, let's prioritize work-related goal-setting and relationship with your parents for today's agenda. It's great that you've identified these as your top priorities.

We'll start by discussing your experience with breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable steps and explore how perfectionism might be impacting your ability to set realistic goals. We'll also look at strategies to manage perfectionism and be kinder to yourself in the goal-setting process.

Regarding your relationship with your parents, we'll discuss your feelings and concerns and explore ways to communicate your needs and boundary set while maintaining your family relationships. 

Let's start with work-related goal-setting. Can you share an example of a task or project that you've been struggling to break down into smaller steps?

Patient: Sure, I've been working on a new collection for GreenThread. I have all these ideas in my head, but when I try to put them on paper, I get overwhelmed. I keep redoing the sketches and fabric choices because I'm never satisfied with the results. It's like I'm stuck in a loop, and I can't move forward.

Therapist: That's a great example to work with. It seems like perfectionism is really getting in the way of you completing this project. Let's break it down together to see if we can identify smaller, more manageable steps you could take.

Before we start, I want to check in with you. How are you feeling about this project right now, as we discuss it?

Patient: I feel overwhelmed just thinking about it. I keep imagining all the tiny details that could go wrong, and it paralyzes me. I'm worried that if I don't get it just right, it will all fall apart.

Therapist: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when you have high standards for your work. I want to help you find a balance between excellence and perfectionism. 

Let's start by identifying the specific parts of the project that are causing you the most stress. What are some of the key components of this new collection?

Patient: Okay, so the main components are the design sketches, fabric selection, and production planning. Each of these has multiple sub-tasks, like choosing color palettes, sourcing materials, and coordinating with manufacturers.

Therapist: That's a great analysis. Now, let's focus on one component at a time. For the design sketches, what would be a realistic goal for you to achieve this week?

Patient: I think a realistic goal would be to finalize the initial sketches for three outfits. I usually aim for five, but I know I need to start small and build up.

Therapist: That sounds like a good goal. Breaking it down to three outfits is more manageable than five. What would you do differently in approaching these sketches to ensure you're being realistic and not aiming for perfectionism?

Patient: I could set a time limit for each sketch and stick to it. Maybe 30 minutes per sketch, and then move on, even if I'm not completely satisfied. I also need to remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that I can always refine later.

Therapist: Those are great strategies. Setting a time limit can help you stay focused and avoid getting stuck in perfectionism. And reminding yourself that mistakes are part of the process will reduce your fear of them.

Now that you have a clear goal for the design sketches, what might be a smaller task you could complete within that 30-minute time limit?

Patient: Within that 30-minute time limit, I could start by sketching the basic outline of the outfit, focusing on the silhouette and key design elements. I usually get bogged down in details, so keeping it simple at first would help.

Therapist: That's a great idea. Starting with the basic outline keeps you focused and avoids getting overwhelmed by details. Remember, we're aiming for progress, not perfection.

Now that you have a clear goal and a first step, how confident are you in your ability to complete this task without getting stuck in perfectionism?

Patient: I'm feeling a bit more confident now. I know it's going to be hard to break the habit of perfectionism, but having a clear plan and time limit helps. I'll give it a try and see how it goes.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear you're feeling more confident. Remember, it's normal to have some challenges when changing long-standing habits. Be kind to yourself and celebrate each small accomplishment.

Now that we have a plan for the design sketches, let's assign a specific time to complete this task. What day and time do you think you'll have available in the next week?

Patient: I can set aside time on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, around 2 PM. Those are usually quieter times for me, and I can focus better without interruptions.

Therapist: Tuesday and Thursday afternoons at 2 PM sounds like a great plan. Knowing when and where you'll be doing the task can help you follow through and make it part of your routine.

As you work on your design sketches, remember to be mindful of any perfectionistic thoughts that arise. If you notice yourself getting stuck in those thoughts, take a moment to pause and challenge them. Ask yourself questions like: Is this really necessary? Is perfectionism getting in the way here? What would a friend or colleague say to this thought?

After you complete the sketches, take a moment to review them and practice self-compassion. Celebrate the progress you've made and acknowledge that you did the best you could with the time and energy you had available.

Patient: That's good advice. I'll try to be mindful of those perfectionistic thoughts and challenge them when they come up. And I'll definitely take a moment to celebrate my progress after completing the sketches. It's important to recognize that I'm making steps forward, even if they're small.

Therapist: Absolutely! Celebrating your progress, no matter how small, is key to building momentum and boosting your confidence. And remember, every time you challenge a perfectionistic thought, you're reinforcing a new, more adaptive way of thinking.

Now that we have a plan for the design sketches, let's discuss how to break down the other components of your project: fabric selection and production planning. We can use a similar approach, setting small, realistic goals and breaking them down into manageable tasks.

What thoughts come to mind when you think about the fabric selection process? What are some potential challenges or obstacles?

Patient: When I think about fabric selection, I worry about finding the perfect materials that are both sustainable and high-quality. I don't want to compromise on either aspect, which can make the process overwhelming. I also get anxious about making the wrong choice and wasting resources.

Therapist: It's understandable to have those concerns, especially when sustainability and quality are top priorities for your work. Let's break down the fabric selection process into smaller steps to make it more manageable.

One approach could be to start by creating a list of criteria for the fabrics you're looking for, such as fiber type, weight, drape, and durability. Then, research suppliers that specialize in those types of fabrics and review their available options. Next, narrow down your choices to a few top contenders and order small samples to evaluate in-person.

What do you think about this approach? Can you see how breaking it down into steps could help make the process feel more manageable?

Patient: That sounds like a good approach. Breaking it down into steps definitely makes it feel less overwhelming. I can start by creating a list of criteria and researching suppliers. Then, I can order samples and evaluate them without feeling like I have to make a final decision right away.

Therapist: I'm glad this approach resonates with you. Remember, the goal is to make the process more manageable, not perfect. Each step you take brings you closer to completing the fabric selection, and each sample evaluated is progress.

As you work through this process, pay attention to any perfectionistic thoughts that may arise, such as "I need to find the perfect fabric" or "If this fabric isn't perfect, the entire project will fail." When you notice these thoughts, pause and challenge them. Ask yourself, "What is the worst that could happen if I don't find the 'perfect' fabric?" Often, the reality is less catastrophic than our fears lead us to believe.

Another strategy is to practice self-compassion. Instead of beating yourself up for not finding the "perfect" fabric, treat yourself with kindness and understanding. Remember, perfectionism is a common but unhelpful tendency, and you're working hard to find a balance between your values and your goals.

Patient: I appreciate the reminder to practice self-compassion. It's easy to get caught up in those perfectionistic thoughts and feel like I'm failing if things aren't perfect. I'll try to be kinder to myself and remember that progress, even if it's not perfect, is still progress.

Therapist: Exactly! Practicing self-compassion is an essential skill in managing perfectionism. When you notice yourself being self-critical, take a moment to pause, acknowledge your efforts, and offer yourself some kind words. This can help you maintain perspective and keep moving forward.

Now that we've discussed breaking down the fabric selection process, let's shift our focus to production planning. What thoughts come to mind when you think about coordinating with manufacturers and setting timelines?

Patient: When I think about coordinating with manufacturers and setting timelines, I feel a mix of anxiety and excitement. On one hand, I'm eager to see my designs come to life, but on the other, I worry about potential delays or issues that could arise. I also feel pressure to get everything right the first time, which can be overwhelming.

Therapist: It's great that you're feeling both eager and anxious about this stage. That mix of emotions is quite normal when embarking on a new project with high stakes. Let's work on managing those concerns so that you can maintain momentum and stay grounded.

One strategy to address potential delays or issues is to develop a contingency plan. This could include identifying backup suppliers, negotiating flexible timelines, and allocating buffer time for unforeseen events. Having a clear plan in place can help you feel more prepared and less anxious about the unexpected.

When it comes to getting everything "right" the first time, remember that perfectionism is often more of a barrier than a benefit. While it's important to pay attention to detail, it's equally vital to recognize that some things can't be controlled or perfected. By acknowledging that reality, you can reduce the pressure on yourself and focus on what you can control—like communicating clearly and frequently with your manufacturers.

What do you think about these strategies for managing anxiety and perfectionism in the production planning process?

Patient: Developing a contingency plan sounds like a smart move. It would help me feel more prepared and less anxious about potential issues. And I agree that acknowledging what I can't control is important. It's hard to let go of that need for perfection, but I know it's something I need to work on.

Therapist: You're right that letting go of perfectionism can be challenging, but with practice, it becomes easier over time. One helpful approach is to set realistic, achievable goals for the project. Instead of expecting everything to be perfect, focus on delivering a quality product on time, even if it's not exactly as you envisioned. This shift in mindset can help you let go of perfectionism and feel more satisfied with your work.

Another strategy is to celebrate your progress and successes along the way. Break the project down into smaller tasks and give yourself credit for completing each one, no matter how small it may seem. By focusing on the process rather than the end goal, you can remain engaged, motivated, and more resilient in the face of challenges.

What do you think about these strategies for managing perfectionism and staying grounded in the production planning process?

Patient: Setting realistic goals and celebrating progress sounds like a good way to manage my perfectionism. It's easy to get caught up in the end goal and forget to appreciate the steps along the way. I'll try to focus on breaking the project into smaller tasks and giving myself credit for each one I complete.

Therapist: That's a great plan! Celebrating your progress and giving yourself credit for each task you complete can help you feel more motivated and less overwhelmed. Remember, every step is an opportunity to learn and grow.

As you work through the production planning process, pay attention to any perfectionistic thoughts that arise and practice challenging them. Ask yourself questions like: "Is this really necessary? Is perfectionism getting in the way here?" When you notice these thoughts, take a moment to pause and reframe them in a more balanced, realistic way.

Also, make sure to set aside time for self-care and relaxation during the process. Engaging in activities that bring you joy, relaxation, or a sense of accomplishment can help you maintain your mental health and resilience.

Patient: Challenging those perfectionistic thoughts is definitely something I need to work on. It's hard to let go of that need for everything to be perfect, but I know it's important for my mental health. And you're right, self-care is crucial. I've been so focused on the business that I've neglected my own well-being. I'll make sure to set aside time for yoga and meditation, which usually help me feel more grounded.

Therapist: I'm glad you recognize the importance of self-care and have identified activities that help you feel grounded. Incorporating those practices into your routine can make a big difference in your overall well-being and ability to manage stress and perfectionism.
