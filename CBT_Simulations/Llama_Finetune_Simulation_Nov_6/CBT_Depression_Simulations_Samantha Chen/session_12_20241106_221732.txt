Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again for our 12th session. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist before we begin. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to the bedtime routine and practice progressive muscle relaxation before bed. It's been a bit of a mixed bag. Some nights I fall asleep easier, but other nights I still lie awake, worrying about business decisions and family stuff. I've also been reading more before bed, which helps a bit. But I've noticed that my emotional eating has gotten worse. I've been bingeing on sugary cereals and ice cream almost every night. It's like I can't stop myself, even though I know it's not good for me. I feel really ashamed about it.

Therapist: Thank you for your honesty, Samantha. It's common to face challenges when implementing new coping strategies, and progress isn't always linear. I'm glad to hear that the bedtime routine and reading have provided some relief on certain nights. However, I'm also concerned about your increased emotional eating. This is an important topic for us to discuss today. Let's add it to our agenda, along with reviewing your experiences with the CBT techniques we've practiced. We can also discuss any anxiety related to business or family matters that may have arisen since our last session. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds good. I think talking about the emotional eating and anxiety would be really helpful. I've been feeling so out of control with the eating, and it's making me more anxious about everything else. I'm also worried that my business is not doing as well as I hoped, and I'm getting more pressure from my parents about it. It's all just piling up, and I don't know how to handle it all.

Therapist: I understand that everything feels overwhelming right now, and it's important that we work together to find ways to manage your emotions and coping strategies. Let's start by discussing your experiences with the CBT techniques we've practiced. You mentioned that you've been using thought challenging with anxious thoughts. Can you share an example of a thought you've challenged and how it went?

Patient: Sure. One recent example was when I was feeling really overwhelmed about the next quarter’s sales projections for GreenThread. I had this thought that if we don’t meet our targets, the business will collapse and I’ll lose everything. It was really paralyzing. So, I tried to challenge it by asking myself, “How likely is it that the business will fail if we miss this one quarter?” And then I listed out all the other factors that are going well, like our growing customer base and strong brand reputation. It helped to ground me a bit and not get swallowed up by the anxiety.

Therapist: That's a great example of thought challenging, Samantha. You were able to recognize that your anxious thought was extreme and not fully considering the bigger picture. By examining the evidence and considering alternative perspectives, you were able to gain some distance from the anxiety. This is an important skill to continue practicing. Did you face any specific challenges in the process of thought challenging since our last session?

Patient: Yeah, I did. Sometimes it feels like no matter how much I challenge my thoughts, the anxiety still creeps back in. Like, I’ll feel better for a little while, but then I’ll start worrying about something else, and it all comes crashing back. It’s exhausting. And then there’s the emotional eating. I feel like I’m just swapping one bad habit for another. I’m trying to be mindful and challenge my thoughts, but then I end up bingeing on junk food at night. It’s like I can’t win.

Therapist: I hear you, Samantha. Challenging anxious thoughts is a skill that takes practice, and it's common to face setbacks along the way. It's also normal to feel like you're stuck between two opposing coping strategies – the old habit of emotional eating and the new skill of thought challenging. Let's explore this further. Can you share a recent example of when emotional eating felt like a reaction to your efforts at thought challenging?

Patient: Sure. The other night, I was feeling really anxious about a meeting with a potential investor. I tried to challenge my thoughts by reminding myself that even if this investor doesn’t come through, there are others out there. But then I started thinking about how much time and effort I’ve put into this business, and how it all might be for nothing. That’s when I went to the kitchen and started eating a whole box of cereal. It was like I couldn’t handle the anxiety anymore, so I just numbed myself with food.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Samantha. It's a clear example of how anxiety can lead to self-defeating behaviors, even when you're actively working on new coping skills. This is an important insight, as it can help us tailor your treatment plan to better address these challenges. Let's start by setting some goals for today's session. We can prioritize reviewing your experiences with the CBT techniques, discussing your emotional eating and anxiety related to business and family matters, and exploring ways to bridge the gap between your new skills and old coping habits. What are your thoughts on this? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?

Patient: I think that sounds good. I really want to work on finding a better balance between the thought challenging and the emotional eating. It’s like I’m stuck in this cycle, and I don’t know how to break free. I also want to talk more about the pressure from my parents and how it’s affecting me. It’s been really hard lately, and I don’t know how to handle it.

Therapist: Let's dive deeper into the pressure you've been feeling from your parents. Can you share more about what's been happening and how it's been impacting you?

Patient: Sure. Lately, my parents have been really critical of my business decisions. They keep bringing up how risky it was for me to leave my corporate job and start GreenThread. They worry that I’m going to fail and lose everything. It’s been really stressful because I already have so much anxiety about the business, and their comments just make it worse. I feel like I’m constantly disappointing them, and it’s affecting my confidence. I’ve been avoiding family dinners because I can’t handle the tension and the arguments. It’s just too much.

Therapist: Thank you for opening up about this, Samantha. It’s common for family relationships to impact our mental health, especially when we’re also dealing with stressful life circumstances. Let’s explore this further. What thoughts come up for you when your parents make those critical comments about your business?

Patient: It’s like they’re constantly reminding me that I’m not good enough. I start thinking, “What if they’re right? What if I’m making a huge mistake?” And then I spiral into this anxiety where I can’t focus on anything else. I feel like I’m letting them down, and that makes me feel even more anxious about the business. It’s a vicious cycle.

Therapist: You’ve described a pattern where your parents’ comments trigger anxious thoughts and feelings of inadequacy, which then contribute to your anxiety about the business. This cycle can become overwhelming and make it challenging to see the bigger picture. Let’s try to break this down using the CBT framework. First, let’s identify the emotions and thoughts that arise when your parents make those critical comments. What are the most common emotions and thoughts you experience?

Patient: The most common emotions are definitely anxiety and guilt. I feel anxious because I start doubting my decisions and my ability to succeed. And I feel guilty because I think I’m letting them down. The thoughts that come up are things like, “What if they’re right? What if I fail and lose everything?” And then I start thinking, “I’m not good enough to do this.”

Therapist: Thank you for identifying those thoughts and emotions. They’re powerful, and they can create a lot of distress. Now let’s look at how these thoughts and emotions might be influencing your behaviors, like avoiding family dinners. Can you explain how your thoughts and emotions might be contributing to those behaviors?

Patient: I think the anxiety and guilt make me want to avoid situations where I might hear those critical comments. It’s like I’m trying to protect myself from feeling even worse. But at the same time, avoiding them makes me feel even more isolated and disconnected from my family. It’s a tough spot to be in.

Therapist: It’s a difficult situation to be in, and it’s something that many people face in their family relationships. The avoidance behavior, while understandable, can also reinforce the negative thoughts and emotions over time. What do you think would happen if you were able to be present with your family, even in the face of those critical comments?

Patient: I think it would be really hard at first, but maybe it would help me build some resilience. If I could stay present and not let their comments completely derail me, it might help me feel more in control. But I’m not sure how to get there. I’ve tried in the past, and it just ends up in more arguments and hurt feelings.

Therapist: You raise some important points about the challenges of being present in the face of difficult interactions. It’s a skill that takes practice, and it’s not always easy. Let’s brainstorm some strategies that you could try to build that resilience. One technique that might be helpful is called “opposite action,” which involves doing the opposite of what your emotions are telling you to do. For example, if your anxiety is telling you to avoid your family, you could practice going to family gatherings, even if you’re not sure how you’ll react. What are your thoughts on this approach?

Patient: Opposite action sounds interesting, but I’m not sure if I can just force myself to go to family gatherings when I’m feeling so anxious. It feels like it would take a lot of willpower, and I’m already drained from everything else. Is there a way to build up to that, maybe start with smaller steps?

Therapist: That’s a great point, Samantha. Opposite action can be challenging, and it’s often most effective when it’s implemented gradually. Let’s think about some smaller steps you could take to build up your resilience and cope with the anxiety and guilt that come up in these situations. What do you think might be a first step that feels manageable?

Patient: A first step that feels manageable might be attending just one family dinner a month instead of the weekly ones. This way, I’m still engaging but not overwhelming myself. I also think setting a timer for 30 minutes at these dinners could help—once the timer goes off, I can give myself permission to leave if I start to feel too anxious.

Therapist: Those sound like great strategies for gradually building up your presence at family gatherings. Starting with a smaller commitment of one dinner a month and setting a time limit for yourself are excellent ways to pace yourself and manage the anxiety. As you practice these steps, you’ll likely find that your comfort level increases over time. It’s important to remember that this process is a learning curve, and there will be ups and downs along the way. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you navigate these challenges.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I’ll try to be patient with myself. It’s just hard to see progress when everything feels so overwhelming right now. But I’ll give it a shot and see how it goes.

Therapist: You’re doing the best you can, Samantha, and that’s what matters. Remember, change takes time, and every small step counts. Let’s also discuss how you can support yourself through this process. Having a network of people you can turn to for encouragement and understanding can make a big difference. What are some people in your life who you feel comfortable sharing your goals and challenges with?

Patient: I have my partner, Michael, who’s been really supportive. He’s the one who encouraged me to start therapy in the first place. I also have a few close friends who understand what I’m going through, especially since they’ve seen the changes in my behavior over the past few months. I think talking to them about my goals and challenges could help, but I’m still a bit hesitant to open up too much.

Therapist: It’s common to feel hesitant about sharing your struggles, but having those supportive people in your life can make a big difference. You mentioned your partner, Michael, and some close friends who understand what you’re going through. What are some things you might share with them about your therapy goals and challenges?

Patient: I think I could share with Michael and my friends that I’m trying to attend more family dinners and set boundaries for myself, like the 30-minute timer. I could also tell them that I’m working on not letting my parents’ comments affect me as much. It would be nice to have their encouragement and maybe even some practical support, like someone to call if I’m feeling anxious before a dinner.

Therapist: Having those people in your corner can make a big difference as you navigate these challenges. It’s okay to start small with what you share and build trust over time. As you practice sharing your goals and challenges, you’ll likely find that it becomes easier and more rewarding. Remember, your support network is there to help you, and leaning on them can be a powerful part of your journey.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I’ll try to open up more to Michael and my friends. It’s just hard to admit that I’m struggling, especially when I’ve always been the one others look up to. But I know I need to be honest with them if I want to get through this.

Therapist: You’re right, Samantha. It takes courage to admit that you’re struggling, and you’re taking an important step by recognizing your own needs. It’s okay to be honest with the people you trust, and they’ll likely be glad that you’re opening up. As you continue to build trust and share more about your goals and challenges, you’ll likely find that your support network becomes more equipped to help you manage your way through this difficult time.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I’ll keep that in mind. I think I’m ready to give it a try.

Therapist: You’ve shown a lot of strength and courage in facing these challenges today, Samantha. Before we wrap up, let’s discuss some homework assignments that can help you practice the skills we’ve covered in session. First, I’d like you to continue practicing the progressive muscle relaxation before bed, and try to stick to the bedtime routine we discussed. Second, keep using thought challenging with anxious thoughts, and try to notice how your emotions shift when you do. Finally, let’s set a goal for one family dinner this month where you practice your new boundary-setting skills using the 30-minute timer. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds doable. I’ll make sure to practice the progressive muscle relaxation and thought challenging. And I’ll try to use the 30-minute timer at the next family dinner. Hopefully, it’ll help me stay calm and not let their comments get to me as much.

Therapist: That’s great, Samantha. Remember, progress isn’t always linear, and it’s okay if things don’t go perfectly. The important thing is that you’re practicing and learning new skills. Let’s plan to meet again next week to check in on your progress and see how things are going. In the meantime, if you need anything, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I’ll do my best to practice these skills and keep track of how they’re helping me. I’ll see you next week.

Therapist: See you then, Samantha. Take care.
