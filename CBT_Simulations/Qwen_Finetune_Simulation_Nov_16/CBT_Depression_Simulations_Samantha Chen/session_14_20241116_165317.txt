Therapist: Welcome back, Samantha! It's great to see you again for our 14th CBT session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our previous session. I want to acknowledge that while I appreciate you sharing the summary, I also want to remind you of the limitations as an AI therapist. Since we're not able to directly observe non-verbal cues, I sometimes struggle to interpret emotions accurately. Additionally, while I have access to information based on my training, I can't provide information about specific people or situations beyond what you share with me in our sessions.

With that said, I'm curious to know how your mood has been since our last session. Can you share with me how you've been feeling overall?

Patient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Overall, my mood has been a bit up and down. Some days I feel really motivated and excited about GreenThread, but then other days, especially when I'm up late worrying about finances or deadlines, I feel really anxious and overwhelmed. I've been trying to practice the self-compassion techniques we discussed, but it's still a struggle to fully believe in them. I guess I'm just not used to being kind to myself, especially when things aren't going perfectly.

Therapist: I understand that it can be challenging to practice self-compassion, especially when you're not used to it. Remember that it's a skill that takes time to develop, and it's okay if it feels difficult at times. Can you share more about your experience with applying the three-step self-compassion approach in your daily life?

Patient: Sure, I've been trying to use the three-step approach, but it's not always easy. For example, last week I had a meeting with a potential investor who didn't seem very interested in my business plan. After the meeting, I felt really down and started to criticize myself for not being good enough. I tried to acknowledge those feelings, remind myself of my strengths, and practice self-kindness, but it was hard. I ended up replaying the meeting in my head over and over, thinking about what I could have done differently. It's like my mind just won't let go of the negative thoughts.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Samantha. It shows that you're making efforts to apply the self-compassion techniques, even when it's challenging. I appreciate your honesty about the negative thoughts that keep coming up. 

As we continue to work on self-compassion, it can be helpful to explore where those negative thoughts might be coming from. Often, the thoughts we have about ourselves are influenced by deeper beliefs we hold about the world and ourselves. These beliefs are usually formed early in life and can be pretty rigid. In the case of perfectionism, it might be a belief like "I'm only good enough if I'm perfect," or "If I make a mistake, I'm a failure."

Does this resonate at all with you? Can you think of any beliefs that might be contributing to the negative thoughts you experience when things don't go perfectly?

Patient: Yes, that does resonate with me. I think I do have a belief that if I'm not perfect, then I'm not good enough. It's something I've always felt, especially growing up in a high-achieving family where success was always emphasized. I remember my parents being very proud of my academic achievements, but they were also very critical when I didn't do well in something. So, I guess I internalized that belief that I have to be perfect to be worthy of love and approval.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Samantha. That belief about needing to be perfect to be worthy of love and approval is something we can work on challenging in therapy. 

One way we can start to challenge that belief is by looking for evidence that contradicts it. For example, can you think of any times in your life when you didn't meet your own perfect standards, but still felt worthy of love and approval?

Patient: Hmm, that's a tough one. I can't really think of a specific time when I didn't meet my own standards but still felt worthy. I guess that's part of the problemâ€”I've always been so focused on achieving perfection that I haven't allowed myself to feel worthy unless I've succeeded. Even when I quit my corporate job to start GreenThread, I felt like I had to prove myself all over again. It's like I'm constantly chasing this unattainable standard of perfection.

Therapist: Thank you for being so open and honest about that, Samantha. It's a common experience to chase perfection in order to feel worthy, but the truth is that we all deserve love and approval, regardless of whether we meet some unrealistic standard of perfection.

One way we can start to challenge that belief is by intentionally looking for evidence that contradicts it. For example, can you think of a time when you did something imperfectly, but still received love or approval from someone you care about?

Patient: I guess there was a time when I missed a deadline for a project at my old job. I was really hard on myself about it, but my boss still praised me for the quality of the work I did. He said he appreciated my effort and that it was one of the best projects he'd seen. So, I suppose that's an example of receiving approval despite not meeting my own perfectionist standards.

Therapist: That's a great example, Samantha! It shows that you can still receive love and approval, even when you don't meet your own perfect standards. This is an important step in challenging that belief that you need to be perfect to be worthy.

As we continue to work on self-compassion, I encourage you to look for more moments like that, where you can see that you are worthy, even when you're not perfect. It will take time, but with practice, it will get easier to challenge that belief.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I'll try to be more mindful of those moments and remind myself that I'm worthy, even when I'm not perfect. It's definitely something I need to work on, but I appreciate your support and guidance.

Therapist: You've done a great job identifying the origins of your perfectionism, Samantha. Understanding where these beliefs come from can be a powerful step in challenging them.

Now, let's discuss how we can apply this knowledge to your life. One way to start is by setting realistic and achievable goals, rather than perfectionistic ones. Can you think of a goal you've been putting pressure on yourself to meet that might be unrealistic?

Patient: Yes, I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself to secure funding for GreenThread by the end of this month. I've been working non-stop on pitches and presentations, and I feel like if I don't get the funding, it means I've failed. It's been causing a lot of stress and anxiety.

Therapist: That's a great example, Samantha. Setting unrealistic goals, like securing funding by a specific deadline, can contribute to perfectionism and cause stress. One way to challenge this is by setting smaller, more achievable goals related to your business. For example, you could set a goal to reach out to five potential investors this week, rather than focusing on a single, all-or-nothing goal of securing funding.

How do you think setting smaller goals could impact your stress and anxiety levels?

Patient: I think setting smaller goals could definitely help reduce my stress and anxiety. It would allow me to focus on manageable tasks rather than feeling overwhelmed by the big picture. It might also give me a sense of accomplishment along the way, which could boost my confidence and reduce the pressure to be perfect.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Samantha. Setting smaller, achievable goals can help you build momentum and feel more in control of your business. It can also help you develop a more balanced and realistic perspective.

Another aspect of challenging perfectionism is to practice self-compassion when you face setbacks or challenges. Remember, setbacks and challenges are a normal part of any business endeavor, and they don't necessarily mean you've failed.

Can you think of a time when you faced a setback or challenge in your business that you could have approached with more self-compassion?

Patient: Yes, there was a time when I had to scrap an entire collection because the fabric supplier didn't meet our sustainability standards. I was really upset and felt like I had failed. I spent weeks redoing everything, and it was exhausting. If I had been more compassionate with myself, maybe I could have taken a step back, reassessed, and approached it with a clearer mind.

Therapist: That's a perfect example of when to practice self-compassion, Samantha. When you faced that challenge, it would have been helpful to acknowledge your feelings, remind yourself of your strengths and resilience, and offer yourself some kind words or gestures of support.

As we continue to work on challenging perfectionism, remember that you can still maintain high standards for your business while also being kind and understanding to yourself. It's about finding a balance between striving for excellence and accepting that you're human and imperfect.

How do you feel about incorporating self-compassion into your business goals and challenges?

Patient: I think incorporating self-compassion into my business goals and challenges is a good idea. It might help me stay more grounded and less overwhelmed. I'll try to remind myself that setbacks are part of the process and that it's okay to make mistakes as long as I learn from them.

Therapist: That's a great attitude, Samantha. Recognizing that setbacks are a normal part of any business endeavor and that it's okay to make mistakes is an important step in challenging perfectionism. Remember, you can still hold yourself accountable for your work, but do it in a way that is kind and understanding towards yourself.
