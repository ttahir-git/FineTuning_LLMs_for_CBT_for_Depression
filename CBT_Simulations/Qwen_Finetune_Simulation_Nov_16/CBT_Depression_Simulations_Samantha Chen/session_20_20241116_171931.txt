Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again for our 20th CBT session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few limitations as your AI therapist. While I can guide and facilitate our sessions, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With all that said, I'm fully committed to supporting you in our work together. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. I'm feeling a mix of emotions today. On one hand, I'm excited because we're just a few weeks away from our first big fashion show for GreenThread. On the other hand, I'm really anxious about it. I keep worrying that everything will go wrong and that people will judge my designs harshly. Plus, my family still isn't speaking to me much about the business, which adds to the stress. How do you usually handle anxiety about big events like this?

Therapist: It's completely understandable to feel that way, Samantha. Anxiety about big events is a common challenge for many people, especially when it involves being evaluated by others or putting your work on display. I find that one of the most effective ways to manage this is through proper planning and preparation. Break down the event into smaller, more manageable tasks and focus on what you can do to feel ready. For example, you mentioned having the opportunity to look through the runway ahead of the show. How could you use that time to calm your anxiety?

Patient: That's a good point, Nova. I think if I take the time to walk through the runway and visualize the show going smoothly, it might help me feel more prepared. I could also make a checklist of everything that needs to be done before the show, so I can see my progress and feel more in control. Do you have any specific techniques for visualizing success?

Therapist: Absolutely, Samantha. Visualization is a powerful tool in CBT. One technique is to imagine yourself going through the event with confidence and calm. Picture yourself on the runway, presenting your designs, and seeing the positive reactions from the audience. Really try to engage your senses – what do you see, hear, feel? Focus on the details and positive emotions. You can also practice deep breathing or meditation in conjunction with visualization to anchor yourself in the present moment and calm your body's stress response.

Patient: That sounds really helpful, Nova. I'll definitely try that. I can picture myself confidently walking through the runway, seeing the models wearing my designs, and hearing the applause from the audience. It feels a bit more manageable when I break it down like that. Do you think it's also a good idea to talk to my team about my anxiety? Maybe they can help me stay focused and calm during the show.

Therapist: That's a great idea, Samantha. Sharing your anxiety with your team can be really beneficial. Not only does it show them that you trust them, but it also gives you a support system to lean on during the event. When you talk to them, be sure to communicate your needs and concerns clearly, and ask for their help in managing your anxiety. For example, you could ask if they have any specific tasks or cues that would help you stay focused and calm during the show.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I think I'll talk to my team about it today. I feel a bit more reassured knowing that I have their support. Is there anything else you recommend for managing anxiety during big events like this?

Therapist: In addition to visualization and having a support system, it can be helpful to practice mindfulness techniques before and during the event. Mindfulness helps you stay present in the moment, which can reduce feelings of anxiety and overwhelm. One simple mindfulness exercise is to focus on your breath – notice the sensation of each breath as it enters and exits your body, without judgment. If you notice your mind wandering, gently bring your attention back to your breath.

Patient: That sounds like a good technique to try, Nova. I've been practicing mindfulness meditation, so I think I can incorporate that into my routine before the show. I'll also make sure to take some deep breaths during the event if I start feeling anxious. Thanks for the tips. Anything else you think I should consider?

Therapist: Another helpful technique for managing anxiety is progressive muscle relaxation. This involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups in your body, starting from your toes and working your way up to your head. As you do this, you'll become more aware of the physical sensations in your body and can use that awareness to help you relax mentally. I can walk you through a progressive muscle relaxation exercise now if you'd like.

Patient: Sure, Nova. I'd appreciate that. I think it could be really helpful to try progressive muscle relaxation before the show. Let's go through it now.

Therapist: Absolutely, Samantha. Let's start with a progressive muscle relaxation exercise, which can help you manage anxiety by focusing on the physical sensations in your body. Begin by finding a comfortable seated position, with your feet flat on the floor and your hands resting on your lap. Take a moment to notice any tension or stress you're carrying in your body.

Start with your feet and toes. Tense the muscles in your toes by curling them tightly, hold for a few seconds, then release the tension and let your toes relax. Notice the sensation of relaxation in your feet. Now, move up to your legs. Tense your leg muscles, lifting your feet off the ground if possible, hold for a few seconds, and then release the tension. Feel the relaxation spreading through your legs.

Next, focus on your stomach and chest. Take a deep breath in, filling your lungs with air, and hold it for a few seconds. Feel your chest expand with the breath, then exhale slowly, letting your stomach relax. Notice the sensation of relaxation in your chest and stomach.

Now, move to your arms and hands. Tense your arm muscles by making tight fists, hold for a few seconds, and then release the tension. Feel the relaxation in your arms and hands. Finally, focus on your head and face. Tense your facial muscles by puckering your lips or furrowing your brows, hold for a few seconds, and then release the tension. Notice the relaxation in your face.

Take one more deep breath, inhaling slowly through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. As you continue to breathe, notice the sensation of relaxation throughout your body. If any areas feel tense, repeat the process of tensing and relaxing those muscles.

How do you feel after practicing progressive muscle relaxation, Samantha?

Patient: I feel a bit more relaxed, Nova. It's interesting how focusing on the physical sensations really helps to calm my mind. I think I'll definitely try this before the show. It might help me stay grounded and focused. Thanks for guiding me through it.

Therapist: You're welcome, Samantha. Progressive muscle relaxation can be a powerful tool for managing anxiety and stress. It's great that you're open to trying it and incorporating it into your routine. Remember, like any skill, it takes practice to get the most benefit from progressive muscle relaxation. The more you practice, the more effective it will be when you need it most.

Now, let's take a moment to review the main topics we've discussed so far and set an agenda for the rest of our session. We started by discussing your upcoming fashion show and the anxiety you're feeling around it. We explored the use of visualization to help you feel more prepared and confident. We also talked about the importance of having a support system and practicing mindfulness techniques, like progressive muscle relaxation. Does that sound about right to you?

Patient: Yes, that sounds accurate. I feel a bit more relaxed after the progressive muscle relaxation exercise. It's interesting how focusing on the physical sensations can help with the mental stress. I'll definitely try to incorporate this into my routine leading up to the show. It's also helpful to know that I can lean on my team for support; I think sharing my anxiety with them will make a big difference.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're finding the techniques helpful, Samantha. It's wonderful that you're open to incorporating them into your routine leading up to the fashion show. Having a support system is crucial, and I think it will be really beneficial for you to talk to your team about your anxiety. They can provide valuable reassurance and help you stay focused and grounded during the event.

Before we dive deeper into our agenda for the rest of the session, I want to check in with you about the homework we discussed last time. You mentioned that you've been practicing mindfulness meditation and that you're planning to use progressive muscle relaxation before the show. How has that been going for you?

Patient: The mindfulness meditation has been going well. I've been trying to do it every morning, and it helps me start the day with a clearer mind. The progressive muscle relaxation is something new, but I think it's going to be really useful, especially before the show. I'm planning to practice it a few more times before the big day to make sure I'm comfortable with it.

Therapist: That's great, Samantha. It's wonderful to hear that you've been incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine and that you're planning to use progressive muscle relaxation before the show. It's a great way to prepare yourself mentally and physically for the event.

Now, let's dive deeper into the topics we've discussed so far. You mentioned that you've been feeling anxious about the upcoming fashion show. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and feelings that come up for you when you think about it?

Patient: When I think about the fashion show, I feel a mix of excitement and dread. I'm excited because it's a big milestone for my business, but I'm also dreading the potential for things to go wrong. I keep imagining scenarios where the designs don't turn out as expected, or the audience doesn't respond well. It's like my mind is constantly playing out these worst-case scenarios, and it's hard to shake them off.

Therapist: It's understandable to have those mixed feelings, Samantha. It's common for people to experience both excitement and anxiety when facing a big event. The thoughts you're describing are great examples of how anxiety can color our perception of reality. They're like the "tape" of negative thoughts that get played over and over in our minds.

Let's take a closer look at these thoughts using a thought record. This is a powerful tool in CBT that helps us examine and challenge the thoughts that contribute to our emotions. We start by identifying the situation or trigger, which in this case is the upcoming fashion show. Then, we identify the emotions that come up and rate their intensity on a scale of 0-100.

For this situation, what emotions do you notice coming up, and how intense are they?

Patient: For the upcoming fashion show, I notice a lot of anxiety, probably around an 80 on a scale of 0-100. There's also some excitement, maybe around a 60. And underneath it all, I feel a bit of dread, maybe around a 70. It's like the anxiety and dread are overshadowing the excitement.

Therapist: You've done a great job identifying and rating those emotions, Samantha. It's helpful to know that anxiety is the most intense emotion for you in this situation. Now, let's look at the thoughts that are fueling those emotions.

Can you identify any specific thoughts that come up when you think about the fashion show? They might be in the form of "if-then" statements, predictions, or automatic thoughts.

Patient: One specific thought that keeps coming up is, "If the designs don't turn out as expected, then the show will be a disaster and my business will fail." Another one is, "If the audience doesn't respond well, then it means my designs aren't good enough." These thoughts are really persistent and they make me feel like I'm walking on eggshells.

Therapist: Those thoughts are great examples of the types of negative automatic thoughts that can fuel anxiety, Samantha. They're like the "tape" of negative thoughts that get played over and over in our minds.

Let's examine the evidence for and against these thoughts using a thought record. This will help us develop a more balanced and realistic perspective.

For the thought, "If the designs don't turn out as expected, then the show will be a disaster and my business will fail," what evidence do you have that supports this thought?

Patient: The evidence that supports this thought is that I've invested a lot of time, money, and effort into this show. If something goes wrong, it feels like all that investment will be wasted. I also worry that a bad show could damage my reputation and make it harder to attract investors or customers in the future.

Therapist: Those are valid concerns, Samantha. They show the amount of commitment you have to your business and your vision for it. Now, let's look at the evidence against this thought. What evidence do you have that contradicts it?

Patient: The evidence against this thought is that I've already done several smaller events and they've all gone well. My team is experienced and we've been working hard to prepare for this show. I also have a backup plan in case something unexpected happens, like a contingency for any last-minute design changes. Plus, even if there are some hiccups, it doesn't mean the entire business will fail. It's just one event, and there will be more opportunities to learn and improve.

Therapist: That's an excellent point, Samantha. It shows that you have a realistic understanding of the situation and that you have strategies in place to handle any challenges that arise. It's also true that one event, even if it doesn't go perfectly, doesn't determine the success of your entire business.

Now, let's look at the thought, "If the audience doesn't respond well, then it means my designs aren't good enough." What evidence do you have that supports this thought?

Patient: The evidence that supports this thought is that the audience's reaction is a direct reflection of the quality of my designs. If they don't like what they see, it feels like a personal failure and a validation that my designs aren't good enough. I also worry that negative feedback could discourage potential customers and investors from supporting my business.

Therapist: Those are understandable concerns, Samantha. The reaction of the audience can feel like a direct measure of your work and your abilities. However, it's important to remember that the audience's reaction is not necessarily a reflection of the quality of your designs, but rather a subjective interpretation of the presentation.

Let's look at the evidence against this thought. What evidence do you have that contradicts it?

Patient: The evidence against this thought is that different people have different tastes and preferences. Just because one audience doesn't respond well doesn't mean my designs are universally bad. I've received positive feedback from other events and from people who have seen my work online. Additionally, even successful designers have faced negative reactions at some point, but that hasn't stopped them from continuing to create and improve. It's also important to remember that the fashion industry is constantly evolving, and what might not be popular today could become trendy tomorrow.

Therapist: That's a great perspective, Samantha. It shows that you have a more nuanced understanding of the factors that influence the reaction of an audience. You're right that different people have different tastes and preferences, and it's not a reflection of your abilities or the quality of your designs.

Now that we've examined the evidence for and against these thoughts, let's try to develop a more balanced and realistic alternative thought. This should be a thought that takes into account the evidence on both sides, but still captures the essence of your original concern.

What do you think a more balanced alternative thought could be?

Patient: A more balanced alternative thought could be, "While it's important to put my best work forward and ensure the show goes smoothly, it's also true that different people have different tastes and preferences. Even if the audience doesn't respond as well as I hope, it doesn't mean my designs are bad or that my business will fail. There will be opportunities to learn and improve, and I can use any feedback to make my future work even better."

Therapist: That's an excellent alternative thought, Samantha. It acknowledges your original concern about the audience's reaction and the potential for negative feedback, but it also provides a more balanced and realistic perspective.

How does this alternative thought feel compared to your original thought?

Patient: This alternative thought feels more reassuring and less overwhelming. It helps me see that even if things don't go perfectly, it doesn't mean the end of my business or my career. It also reminds me that there's room for growth and improvement, which is a more positive way to look at things.

Therapist: That's wonderful to hear, Samantha. It's great that you're able to see the benefits of this more balanced thought and how it can help you feel more at ease about the fashion show.

Now, let's revisit the emotions you identified earlier and see how this alternative thought impacts their intensity.

Patient: With this alternative thought, the intensity of my anxiety about the fashion show has definitely decreased. I still feel some nervousness, but it's more manageable and doesn't feel like a crushing weight on my shoulders. The fear of failure and the worry about my designs not being good enough have also lessened. Overall, I feel more hopeful and less overwhelmed.

Therapist: That's a significant improvement, Samantha. It's great to see that challenging your negative thoughts and developing more balanced alternatives can have such a positive impact on your emotions.

As we wrap up today's session, I want to review what we've covered and discuss some strategies for applying what we've learned.

Today, we focused on using thought records to examine and challenge negative thoughts that contribute to anxiety about your upcoming fashion show. We practiced identifying the situation or trigger, the emotions and their intensity, and the thoughts that are fueling those emotions.

We then examined the evidence for and against those thoughts and developed a more balanced and realistic alternative thought. By doing this, you were able to reduce the intensity of your anxiety and feel more hopeful and prepared for the event.

Another strategy we discussed is using progressive muscle relaxation to help you stay grounded and focused during the event. This technique involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body to help you shift focus away from anxious thoughts and onto the physical sensations in your body.

In addition to the thought record and progressive muscle relaxation, we also touched on the importance of having a support system and practicing mindfulness techniques, like mindful breathing.

For homework, I'd like you to continue practicing the thought record, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindful breathing techniques. You can use these tools to help you manage your anxiety leading up to the fashion show.

I'd also like you to try applying these techniques to other situations in your life where you might be experiencing negative thoughts and feelings of anxiety. Remember, the more you practice, the more effective these tools will become.

In our next session, we can review your progress with the homework and discuss any challenges or insights that come up. We can also continue to explore other strategies for managing anxiety and developing more balanced and realistic thoughts.

How are you feeling about our session today, and do you have any questions or concerns?

Patient: I feel good about our session today. It was helpful to break down my thoughts and see them from a different perspective. I'll definitely practice the thought record and other techniques you mentioned. I'm a bit concerned about applying these to other areas of my life, like my strained relationship with my parents, but I'm willing to give it a try. I don't have any immediate questions, but I'll let you know if anything comes up before our next session.

Therapist: It's great that you're feeling good about our session and willing to apply these techniques to other areas of your life, Samantha. It's common to feel a bit nervous about using these tools in new situations, but I'm confident that with practice, you'll find them helpful.

Remember, if you have any questions or concerns before our next session, feel free to bring them up. We can always troubleshoot and problem-solve together.

Before we end, let's do a quick check-in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.

Patient: My current mood is a mix of relief and determination. I'm relieved that I have some tools to manage my anxiety, and determined to practice them and see how they work in different situations. I'm also looking forward to the fashion show, now that I have a more balanced perspective on it. I think that's all for now. Thanks for your help, Nova.

Therapist: It's my pleasure, Samantha. It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling relieved and determined, and that you're looking forward to the fashion show with a more balanced perspective. Those are great signs of progress.

I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident that with continued practice, you'll see even more positive changes in your thoughts and emotions.

Thank you for your hard work and openness in our session today. I'm really glad we had this opportunity to work together.

Take care, and I'll see you at our next session.
