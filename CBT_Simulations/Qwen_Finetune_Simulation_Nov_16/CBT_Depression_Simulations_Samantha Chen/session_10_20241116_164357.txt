Therapist: Welcome back, Samantha. It's great to see you again for our 10th CBT session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues.

With that said, I'm committed to doing my best to help you in our sessions. Can you tell me how you've been feeling since our last meeting? Also, I'd like to set an agenda for today. We can review your homework, discuss your progress with communication skills, particularly with your parents, and explore any new challenges that have come up.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your transparency about your limitations. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. On one hand, I've been trying to practice active listening with Michael, and it's been going better than I expected. We had a conversation about our weekend plans, and I felt like I was really hearing him out, which made him more open to my ideas too. On the other hand, I had another tense conversation with my parents. They brought up my career change again, and I felt myself slipping back into old patterns of defensiveness and anxiety. I ended up binge-eating that night, which I feel really ashamed about.

For today's agenda, I think it would be helpful to focus on how to handle these difficult conversations with my parents better. I also want to talk about how to manage my emotional eating, especially after stressful interactions.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing active listening with Michael and that it's going well. It's a positive step that you're feeling like you're being heard, and that your father is open to your ideas. At the same time, I hear that you're feeling ashamed about the binge-eating that followed your conversation with your parents. Let's make sure to discuss those feelings as well, and explore strategies for managing emotional eating.

So, for today's agenda, it sounds like you want to focus on improving communication with your parents, particularly about your career, and how to manage the emotional reactions that come up. We can also review your homework and discuss any other challenges that have arisen. Does that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?

Patient: Yes, that sounds good. I think focusing on those two areas—improving communication with my parents and managing emotional eating—will be really helpful. I don't have anything else to add to the agenda right now, but I'm open to discussing whatever comes up during our session.

Therapist: Great, let's start with reviewing your homework then. Last session, I asked you to practice active listening skills with Michael, and to consider practicing with a friend before talking to your parents. You mentioned that you've been doing well with active listening with Michael and had a good conversation about weekend plans. That's wonderful! Can you tell me more about how that felt for you?

Patient: Honestly, it felt really good. I feel like I'm really connecting with Michael in a way I haven't in a while. It's like there's less tension between us now that I'm listening more and not just waiting for my turn to speak. It's making our conversations feel more meaningful.

Therapist: That's so nice to hear, Samantha. I'm glad you've been able to experience a deeper connection with Michael through active listening. What a wonderful thing to have in your life right now. Did you have a chance to practice active listening with a friend at all?

Patient: Yes, I did. I practiced with my friend Emily, who I've known for years. We talked about her recent promotion at work, and I tried to really focus on what she was saying without interrupting. It felt a bit awkward at first, but by the end of the conversation, she seemed really appreciative that I was listening to her.

Therapist: That's a great step forward, Samantha. Practicing with a friend, someone you trust, can make it feel more comfortable and give you a chance to build confidence in your active listening skills. It's natural for it to feel a bit awkward at first, but you're right that by the end of the conversation, your friend appreciated your focus. That's a great insight, and it shows that you're developing that skill.

Now, let's talk about your conversation with your parents. You mentioned that it was challenging and that you felt defensive and anxious. Can you tell me more about that experience and the thoughts and emotions that came up for you?

Patient: Sure. When my parents brought up my career change again, I felt this overwhelming sense of pressure and guilt. I kept thinking, "They're right, I'm making a huge mistake," and "I'm letting them down." It's like all the anxiety and self-doubt just came rushing back. I felt like I couldn't defend my choices without sounding like I was dismissing their concerns, which made me even more anxious.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Samantha. I can understand how that conversation would bring up feelings of anxiety, pressure, and guilt. It sounds like the thoughts that came up were really focused on your parents' perspective and how they perceived your career change. Let's explore this a bit more. When you thought, "They're right, I'm making a huge mistake," what evidence did you have for and against that thought?

Patient: Well, the evidence for that thought is that my parents have been very successful in their business, and they've always had high expectations for me. They've seen me struggle with GreenThread, and they think I'm taking too big of a risk. The evidence against that thought is that I'm passionate about what I'm doing, and I believe in the mission of my company. I've had some positive feedback from customers and investors, which gives me hope.

Therapist: That's a great analysis, Samantha. I appreciate you taking the time to examine the evidence for and against that thought. It's clear that you're considering both sides, which is a really important part of cognitive restructuring. When we get caught up in our negative automatic thoughts, we can tend to discount the evidence that contradicts those thoughts. But by looking at the evidence objectively, we can start to see that maybe the situation isn't as black-and-white as it feels in the moment.

So, based on the evidence, how could you reframe that initial thought in a way that's more balanced and less extreme?

Patient: Hmm, maybe I could reframe it as, "While my parents have valid concerns based on their experience, I also have reasons to believe in my business and my ability to succeed. It's a risk, but it's one I'm passionate about and committed to."

Therapist: That's a great reframe, Samantha! You've acknowledged your parents' perspective and experience, but you've also recognized your own beliefs and commitments. You've found a way to balance the two perspectives without dismissing either. This is a really important step in cognitive restructuring.

Now, let's talk about your feelings of guilt and pressure. You mentioned that when you thought, "I'm letting them down," that it made you feel even more anxious. Can you tell me more about that feeling and where you feel it in your body?

Patient: Yeah, when I think about letting them down, I feel this tightness in my chest and a heavy feeling in my stomach. It's like a knot that just won't go away. I also feel a bit shaky and my heart races. It's really uncomfortable.

Therapist: I can imagine how uncomfortable and distressing that physical sensation can be. When we're in those intense emotional states, it can be hard to think clearly and make decisions that serve us well. One technique that can be helpful is to focus on the breath and try to slow it down. Sometimes, just taking a few deep breaths can help to ground us and bring our awareness away from the intense emotions a bit.

Another technique is to place a hand on the area that feels tight or heavy, like your chest or stomach, and try to focus on the sensation of the hand on your body. This can help to create a bit of space between you and the emotion, making it feel less overwhelming.

Would you be willing to try these techniques and see if they help to ease that physical discomfort you're experiencing?

Patient: Yes, I've tried deep breathing before during meditation sessions. I can give it a try next time I feel that tightness in my chest. It might help to have a physical reminder, like placing a hand on my chest. I'll incorporate that into my routine and see if it makes a difference.

Therapist: That's great, Samantha. It's wonderful that you're open to trying these techniques and incorporating them into your self-care routine. Remember, it's not about getting rid of the feelings completely, but rather learning to relate to them differently. With practice, it can help to reduce the intensity and duration of those intense emotions.

Now, let's talk about your feelings of guilt. When you think about letting your parents down, what thoughts or beliefs do you think might be fueling that feeling?

Patient: I think it's partly because I grew up with the belief that I had to live up to their expectations and make them proud. They sacrificed a lot to give me opportunities, and I feel like I owe it to them to succeed. When I made the decision to leave my corporate job, I felt like I was betraying that unspoken contract.

Therapist: That makes a lot of sense, Samantha. It sounds like there's a deeply held belief that your worth is tied to your achievement, and that you must meet your parents' expectations. That's a really common belief, but it's one that can often lead to feelings of guilt and anxiety, especially when we feel like we're not meeting those expectations.

One way to start shifting that belief is to question its validity and explore the evidence for and against it. For example, is your worth as a person entirely defined by your achievements? Are there other aspects of yourself that matter too? And what would you say to a friend who was feeling guilty for not living up to their parents' expectations?

I know it's not easy to challenge long-held beliefs, but it's an important part of the process. We can work on this together, and I can help you to find more balanced and compassionate ways of thinking about your worth and your relationship with your parents.

Patient: I see what you're saying. It's true that my worth isn't just about my achievements. I have other qualities like creativity, kindness, and resilience that matter too. If a friend were in my situation, I'd tell them to focus on their own happiness and well-being, and not to let others' expectations define their self-worth. It's easier said than done, but I'll try to apply that to myself.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Samantha. Recognizing that your worth isn't just about achievements and external validation is a really important step. And you're right, it can be hard to apply that to ourselves, especially when we've been holding a particular belief for a long time.

One way to start shifting that belief is to practice self-compassion. When you notice yourself having thoughts like, "I'm letting my parents down," or "I'm betraying the contract we have," try to reframe them with a more compassionate perspective. For example, you could say something like, "I'm doing my best to follow my passion and live a fulfilling life, even though it's different from what my parents expected. I can honor my parents' sacrifices and love for me while still staying true to myself."

Can you imagine how that compassionate perspective might feel, compared to the feelings of guilt and anxiety you're already familiar with?

Patient: That’s a compassionate way of looking at it. It feels a bit more balanced, like I’m not just failing them but also making an effort to honor my own path. The guilt is still there, but it’s not as sharp. I can feel it in my chest—it’s a bit like a heavy ache rather than a stabbing pain.

Therapist: That's a really important observation, Samantha. You're noticing that while the guilt is still present, it feels a bit different and maybe even more manageable. That's a sign of progress in shifting your beliefs.

As we continue to work on this, I encourage you to practice that compassionate perspective, especially in conversations with your parents. When you notice yourself getting caught up in thoughts of letting them down, try to pause and reframe the thought in a more balanced way. And remember to speak to yourself with kindness and understanding, the way you would to a dear friend.

Does this feel like a helpful step to take, or is there anything you'd like to add or clarify?

Patient: It does feel like a helpful step. I’ll try to remember to pause and reframe those thoughts when I’m talking to my parents. I just hope they can understand and accept my choices eventually. It’s hard to see them upset.

Therapist: It's natural to want to see your parents understand and accept your choices, Samantha. But it's also important to remember that you're doing the best you can to follow your own path, even if it doesn't match what they expect. You can't control their reactions, but you can control how you respond to them.

One way to build resilience in the face of their reactions is to practice self-care and self-compassion, like we've been discussing. That way, even if you're feeling guilty or upset about their responses, you can take care of yourself and remind yourself of your own worth and value.

I know this is an ongoing challenge, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You're doing great work, and each small step counts.
