Session Number: 8

Patient: Hi, I'm Marcus Thompson. This is my 8 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

I understand how challenging it can be to balance caring for your mother while managing your other responsibilities. The guilt you're feeling is a natural response, but it's important to remember that taking care of yourself and maintaining other important aspects of your life doesn't make you a bad son.

Let's explore some strategies to help manage both your time and these feelings of guilt:

1. Create a structured schedule: Set specific times for visiting your mother, ensuring quality time rather than quantity. This might help reduce guilt by knowing you have dedicated time planned.

2. Practice self-compassion: When you notice guilty thoughts arising, try acknowledging them without judgment and remind yourself that you're doing your best to balance multiple important responsibilities.

3. Consider additional support: Have you looked into respite care or other support services that could help share the caregiving responsibilities? This could give you peace of mind when you need to focus on other areas of your life.

4. Set realistic expectations: You can't be everywhere at once, and that's okay. What would you tell a friend in your situation?

How do these suggestions resonate with you? What do you think might be most helpful in managing these competing demands?

Therapist: It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed by your responsibilities, Marcus. Learning to balance caregiving, work, and self-care can be challenging, but it's essential for maintaining your mental health and well-being.

One way to start managing these challenges is by setting boundaries. Let's discuss how you can communicate your needs and limitations to others, like your sister and colleagues, to help create a more balanced schedule.

Patient: Setting boundaries is definitely something I've been struggling with. I feel like if I don't do everything, it won't get done right. But I know that's not sustainable. I guess I need to figure out how to say no without feeling guilty.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Marcus. Learning to say no and set boundaries is a crucial skill in managing stress and preventing burnout. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a situation where you felt like you couldn't say no?

Patient: Sure, there was this one time when my principal asked me to take on an extra after-school program. I knew I was already stretched thin with my regular classes and my mom's care, but I didn't want to let the school down. So, I said yes, and it ended up making me even more exhausted. I felt like I was failing at everything because I was trying to do too much.

Therapist: That's a great example of a situation where setting boundaries would have been helpful. Let's break this down and see how you could communicate your needs in a way that feels more manageable.

When your principal asked you to take on the extra program, what thoughts were going through your mind?

Patient: I was thinking that if I didn't do it, no one else would step up. I felt like it was my responsibility to help the students, especially since I know how much they need the extra support. Plus, I didn't want to seem like I was shirking my duties.

Therapist: Those thoughts are understandable, but they're also assumptions that might be contributing to your guilt and stress. Let's look at this situation more objectively. What would you say to a friend who was in the same situation, and they didn't want to take on the extra program?

Patient: I'd tell them that it's okay to prioritize their own well-being and that they don't have to do everything alone. I'd encourage them to talk to their principal about their current workload and see if there's a way to share the responsibility with others.

Therapist: That's a great perspective shift, Marcus. You're recognizing that everyone needs to prioritize self-care and that it's okay to have limits. When you think about saying no, you might consider framing it in a way that focuses on your current capacity and need for balance.

For example, you could say something like, "Thank you for thinking of me for this program. I'm really proud of you for bringing this opportunity forward. I'm not able to commit to taking it on right now due to some other major commitments in my life. Is there any way we could explore other options to support the students, given my current workload?"

How do you think that might work in this situation?

Patient: That sounds like a much better way to handle it. I think if I frame it like that, it shows that I'm still supportive and committed, but just need to manage my time better. It might also open up the possibility of getting others involved, which could actually benefit the students more in the long run.

Therapist: Exactly! You're communicating your support while also setting a boundary on your capacity. This approach can help you feel less overwhelmed and more empowered to take care of your responsibilities.

Let's practice saying no in a similar way with another example. Imagine a friend asks you to cover a shift at the animal shelter on a day when you have a lot going on with your mom and work. How would you apply this boundary-setting technique?
