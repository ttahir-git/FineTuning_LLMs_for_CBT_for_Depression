Therapist: Welcome back, Naomi. It's great to see you again for this 20th CBT session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. It's good to be aware of those. I appreciate your transparency.

Since our last session, I've been feeling a bit up and down. The mindfulness meditation has been helpful, but I still struggle with staying consistent. I've managed to do it a few times, but not every day like I wanted. 

Academically, I had a tough week. I had a big presentation that I was really nervous about, and I couldn't help but think I was going to bomb it. Those negative thoughts really got to me. I tried using the thought records, but it was hard to stay objective when I was so stressed.

On a positive note, I had a good conversation with my sister about my gender identity. She's been really supportive, and it helped to have someone who understands. But I still haven't found the right time to talk to my parents about it. It's been weighing on me.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you've had some helpful interactions, like the conversation with your sister. It takes courage to open up about these things. At the same time, I understand that talking to your parents can be daunting, especially when it comes to discussing your gender identity.

I also hear that the presentation was a challenging situation for you. It's common to have negative thoughts in high-pressure scenarios like that. Let's explore that further. Can you walk me through what happened and the thoughts and emotions you experienced?

Patient: Sure, I can try to break it down. Leading up to the presentation, I started feeling really anxious. I kept thinking, "What if I forget everything I prepared?" or "What if my classmates think I'm not good enough?" These thoughts just spiraled, making me more nervous.

On the day of the presentation, I felt a mix of dread and panic. My heart was racing, and I had trouble focusing. When it was my turn to present, I could barely get the words out. I stumbled over a few points, and I could see some of my classmates looking confused. That just made me feel worse.

After it was over, I felt a huge wave of relief, but also a lot of self-criticism. I kept replaying the parts where I stumbled, thinking, "I should have done better" or "I'm not cut out for this." It was hard to shake those thoughts off.

I did try to use the thought records, but it was tough to stay objective when I was so emotionally charged. I guess I need more practice with that.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It takes a lot of courage to open up about such a vulnerable experience. What you described is a great example of how our thoughts can impact our emotions and behaviors. The negative thoughts you experienced before and after the presentation likely contributed to your anxiety, and that anxiety affected your ability to perform at your best.

You mentioned that you tried using thought records but found it challenging to stay objective when you were feeling emotionally overwhelmed. This is a great insight. It's often easier to challenge negative thoughts when we're calm and collected, but in stressful moments, it takes more effort.

Given what you've shared, I'm wondering if we could focus on a few key areas in today's session. First, we could explore strategies for managing anxiety in high-stakes situations, like presentations. Second, we could practice using thought records in moments when you're feeling emotionally charged. And third, we could discuss how to approach the conversation with your parents about your gender identity in a way that feels manageable for you.

What do you think about focusing on those areas today? I know we've covered a lot of ground already, so we can prioritize what feels most important.

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I think managing anxiety in high-stakes situations and practicing thought records in emotionally charged moments are both really important for me right now. The conversation with my parents is definitely something I need to work on, but I think I need more time to prepare for that.

For the anxiety and thought records, maybe we could start with some specific examples or exercises? I feel like having a concrete plan or method would help me apply these techniques better when I'm actually in those stressful situations.

Therapist: Absolutely, Naomi. We can definitely do that. Before we dive into the exercises, let's make sure we understand the goals and what you hope to take away from this session. You mentioned that you want to work on managing anxiety in high-stakes situations, using thought records during emotionally charged moments, and preparing for the conversation with your parents about your gender identity. Does that capture the main points you want to focus on today?

Patient: Yes, that captures it well. I'm especially keen on managing anxiety and using thought records effectively. The conversation with my parents is important, but I think I need more time to gather my thoughts and build up the courage for that.

Therapist: That's a great understanding, Naomi. Let's start with managing anxiety in high-stakes situations. One strategy that can be effective is called "cognitive restructuring," which is essentially the same technique we've been practicing with thought records. The idea is to identify the negative thoughts that are contributing to your anxiety, examine the evidence for and against those thoughts, and then generate more balanced and helpful thoughts.

For example, let's say you're feeling anxious about an upcoming presentation. One of your thoughts might be, "I'm going to mess up and embarrass myself." To challenge that thought, you would ask yourself, "Is there evidence to support this thought? Could there be alternative explanations?" You might recognize that you've successfully completed presentations before, and even if you do make a mistake, it doesn't mean you'll embarrass yourself or that it's a reflection of your overall abilities.

Does that make sense? Can you think of a recent situation where you might have applied this technique?

Patient: Yes, that makes sense. I think I could have used that technique before my last presentation. I had a lot of negative thoughts like "I'm not going to do well" and "everyone will judge me." If I had challenged those thoughts, I might have felt less anxious. 

So, to put it into practice, I could think about whether I've done presentations before and how they went, and remind myself that even if I make a mistake, it's not the end of the world.

Therapist: Exactly! That's a great way to apply cognitive restructuring in the moment. Another technique that can be helpful for managing anxiety in high-stakes situations is called "behavioral activation." This involves gradually facing the anxiety-provoking situation, starting with smaller, more manageable tasks and working your way up to larger challenges.

For example, instead of waiting to feel more confident before preparing for a presentation, you might set a specific goal for how much time you'll spend preparing, even if you don't feel ready. Or you could practice presenting to a trusted friend or family member first, to build your confidence in low-pressure settings.

The key is to break down the situation into smaller steps and focus on taking action, even if you don't feel completely prepared. This can help you build resilience over time and reduce your anxiety in the long run.

What do you think about trying some of those behavioral activation techniques this week?

Patient: That sounds like a good approach. I think breaking down the tasks and taking small steps could really help me feel more in control. I could start by setting aside specific times to practice my presentation, even if it's just for a few minutes each day. And maybe I could ask my sister to listen to a practice run. She's supportive, so it would be a low-pressure environment.

I'll give it a try this week and see how it goes.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Naomi. I'm glad you're open to trying some of these techniques. Remember, it's okay if it feels challenging at first. The more you practice, the easier it will become.

As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling. What's your mood right now, and what are some of your main takeaways from today's discussion?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful, to be honest. I think the idea of breaking down tasks and practicing in smaller steps is something I can really work with. My main takeaway is that I don't have to feel completely ready or confident to start taking action. Even small steps can make a big difference.

I'm also feeling a bit more positive about using thought records in emotionally charged moments. I know it's going to take practice, but I'm willing to give it a try.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and motivated. Those are really positive takeaways from our discussion today. Remember, progress isn't always linear, so be patient with yourself as you practice these new skills.

Before we end, let's make sure we have a clear plan for the homework assignments. You mentioned that you're going to practice behavioral activation by setting aside specific times to practice your presentation and asking your sister to listen to a practice run. Is that right?

Patient: Yes, that's right. I'll set aside time each day to practice my presentation and ask my sister to listen to a practice run. I'll also try to use thought records when I start feeling anxious about it.

Is there anything else you think I should focus on this week?

Therapist: One thing that might be helpful is to continue with the thought records, but also try to do them in situations where you're feeling a bit more charged. It's great if you can do them when you're feeling calm, but the real benefit comes when you can apply them in those more challenging moments.

So, my suggestion is to set aside a specific time each day to do your thought records, even if you're not feeling particularly anxious, and then try to do at least one thought record in a more charged situation, like when you're feeling nervous about your presentation.

How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds really practical and doable. I'll definitely make sure to do the thought records even when I'm feeling calm, and then really push myself to use them when I'm anxious about the presentation. I think that could make a big difference.

Therapist: That's great, Naomi. I'm really glad we were able to come up with a plan that feels manageable for you.

Before we end, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made today. You've shown a lot of insight into your own experiences, and you've been open to trying new techniques, even when it feels challenging. That's a really important part of the therapy process.

I'm curious, what kind of homework do you think would be most helpful for you to focus on this week?

Patient: I think focusing on the thought records and practicing my presentation are the most important things for me this week. I want to make sure I'm really applying the cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation techniques we talked about.

I also think it would be helpful to spend some time journaling about my feelings and experiences, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed. It's something I've done before, and it helps me process things better.

Therapist: Journaling can be a really helpful tool for processing emotions and gaining insight into your experiences. I'm glad you're considering incorporating that into your homework for this week.

So, to recap, your homework for this week includes:
1. Practicing behavioral activation by setting aside specific times to practice your presentation and asking your sister to listen to a practice run.
2. Continuing with thought records, doing one daily and one in a more charged situation.
3. Journaling about your feelings and experiences, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed.

Does that feel like a manageable plan for you?

Patient: Yes, that feels very manageable. I'm excited to put these techniques into practice and see how they help me. I'll make sure to keep track of my progress and bring any insights or challenges to our next session.

Therapist: That's great, Naomi. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next week. Remember, the most important thing is to be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.

Before we end, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any other thoughts you want to share?

Patient: I think that's it for today. I'm feeling more hopeful and ready to tackle the week ahead. Thank you for your support, Nova. I'll see you next week.

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi. I'm really glad to hear that. Remember, if you need any support between sessions, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here for you.

Take care, and I'll see you next week.
