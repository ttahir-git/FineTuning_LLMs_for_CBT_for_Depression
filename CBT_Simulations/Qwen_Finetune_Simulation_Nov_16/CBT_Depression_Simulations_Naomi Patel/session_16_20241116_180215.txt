Therapist: Hi Naomi, it's great to see you again for session 16. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that while I strive to provide the best support possible, I do have some limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. However, I'm fully committed to working with you and supporting your mental health journey to the best of my abilities. 

Now, let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your honesty and commitment to helping me.

Since our last session, I've been feeling a bit of a rollercoaster. On the positive side, I've been practicing those self-compassion phrases you suggested, and they've really helped me during some tough moments. I even used one when I was feeling particularly overwhelmed by a project deadline, and it made a noticeable difference.

However, there have been some challenging moments too. My parents called last weekend, and the conversation was tense. They still struggle to accept my identity, and it left me feeling drained and disheartened. I tried to set a boundary by gently correcting them when they used the wrong pronouns, but it didn't go as smoothly as I hoped. They seemed more upset, and I ended up feeling guilty for "making things worse."

Overall, I'm trying to balance the good and the bad, but it's been tough. I'm still working on those small self-care steps, like taking breaks during study sessions and cooking more vegetarian meals. I just wish the family stuff was easier to navigate.

Therapist: I hear you, Naomi. It's great to see that you're incorporating the self-compassion phrases and making progress with self-care. At the same time, I understand that dealing with family-related issues can be challenging and draining. 

I want to acknowledge the progress you're making and the efforts you're putting into our work together. It's not always easy, but each small step counts, and you're doing a great job of navigating the ups and downs.

Now, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. We can discuss the self-compassion phrases and how they've been helping you, explore the challenging conversation with your parents, and look into additional strategies for managing the impact of family issues on your mental health. What would you like to prioritize today?

Patient: Thanks for acknowledging my efforts, Nova. It means a lot to hear that from you.

For today's session, I think I'd like to prioritize discussing the conversation with my parents. It really stuck with me and I'm still processing how it made me feel. I want to understand better why I felt guilty after trying to set that boundary, and if there's a way to approach similar situations differently in the future.

I'm also curious about how to balance self-compassion with setting boundaries more effectively. I feel like I'm doing okay with self-compassion, but when it comes to boundaries, I still struggle. Maybe we could explore that a bit more?

Therapist: Absolutely, Naomi. Your conversation with your parents and how it made you feel are important topics to discuss. Let's start there and see if we can gain a deeper understanding of what happened and how you might approach similar situations differently.

Before we dive in, I want to check in on your emotional state. How are you feeling right now, as we prepare to explore this challenging topic?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'm feeling a bit anxious and vulnerable right now, to be honest. Talking about my parents always stirs up a lot of emotions, and I'm worried I might get upset. But I also know it's important to address these feelings, so I'm here and ready to talk.

Therapist: I appreciate your honesty and willingness to discuss this difficult topic, Naomi. It's okay to feel anxious and vulnerable. We'll work through it together, and I'll be here to support you. Remember that it's okay to express your emotions and take breaks if you need to. We can go at a pace that feels comfortable for you.

Let's start by discussing what you hoped to get out of setting that boundary with your parents. What were your intentions and expectations going into that conversation?

Patient: My main intention was to assert my identity and have them respect it, even if they didn't fully understand it. I hoped that by gently correcting them, they would start to use the right pronouns and see me as I am. My expectation was that they would eventually come around and be more accepting, even if it took time.

I didn't expect them to get upset or for the conversation to end on a sour note. I thought it would be a small step towards better communication and understanding. But instead, it felt like a step backward, and I ended up feeling guilty for "making things worse."

Therapist: It sounds like you had a clear intention and hope for that conversation, Naomi. It's understandable that you were surprised and disappointed when the outcome wasn't what you expected. Feeling guilty after setting a boundary is a common experience, and it's something we can explore further.

When you said that the conversation felt like a step backward, what specific thoughts or feelings came up for you during or after the interaction?

Patient: During the conversation, I felt a mix of frustration and sadness. I was frustrated because it seemed like no matter what I said, they just couldn't understand or accept me. I felt sad because I really want their approval and acceptance, and it hurts when they don't give it.

After the conversation, I had a lot of self-doubt. I kept thinking, "Maybe I shouldn't have corrected them. Maybe I should have just let it go." I felt guilty for "making things worse" and worried that I was being too demanding or insensitive. I also felt a sense of isolation, like I'm stuck between who I am and who they want me to be.

Therapist: Those thoughts and feelings are so important to acknowledge, Naomi. They give us a lot to work with in understanding what happened and how we can approach the situation differently moving forward.

The guilt you felt after setting the boundary is a significant point to explore. It suggests that there might be some underlying beliefs about your role or responsibility in maintaining family harmony, even if it means sacrificing your own needs and identity.

Let's explore this guilt a bit more. Can you think of a time in the past when you felt a similar guilt, maybe in another situation involving your family?

Patient: You're right, there have been other times where I felt guilty for not conforming to what my family expects of me. Like when I decided to cut my hair short and adopt a more androgynous style. I knew it would upset my parents, and I did it anyway, but I felt really bad afterward. It's like I'm constantly torn between wanting to be true to myself and feeling guilty for the disappointment I cause.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Naomi. It seems like there might be some common themes between the guilt you experienced after setting the boundary with your parents and the guilt you felt when you changed your hair. These experiences might indicate some underlying core beliefs about your role or responsibility in maintaining family harmony, even at the expense of your own needs and identity.

Core beliefs are deeply held beliefs about ourselves, others, and the world around us. They often develop early in life and can be influenced by our experiences, particularly in childhood. Core beliefs are often expressed in the form of "I am," "I'm not good enough," or "I should." They can be difficult to identify and challenge, but once we become aware of them, we can start to examine and reframe them in a more balanced and compassionate way.

Based on what you've shared, it seems like you might have a core belief that goes something like, "I need to sacrifice my own needs and identity to maintain family harmony." This belief might make it difficult for you to set boundaries and assert your identity, because it feels like you're letting your family down by doing so.

What do you think about that possibility? Does it resonate with you?

Patient: That does resonate with me, Nova. I think you're right that I have this belief that I need to sacrifice my own needs to keep the peace in my family. It's like I'm always walking on eggshells, trying not to upset anyone, especially my parents. But it's exhausting and feels like I'm constantly betraying myself.

I want to challenge this belief, but I'm not sure how. Can you help me understand how to start reframing it in a more balanced way?

Therapist: Absolutely, Naomi. Challenging and reframing core beliefs is a central part of the CBT framework, and it's something we can work on together.

One way to start reframing your core belief is to gather evidence that supports a more balanced perspective. For example, you mentioned that setting a boundary with your parents led to feelings of guilt and isolation. However, the boundary did have the effect of making you feel more heard and seen, even if it wasn't the outcome you hoped for. This suggests that challenging your family's expectations and advocating for your own needs can have positive effects, even if they're not immediate or what you initially expected.

Another way to reframe your core belief is to consider how it impacts your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This belief that you need to sacrifice your own needs to maintain family harmony might lead you to suppress your own identity and desires, which can lead to negative thoughts and feelings like guilt, resentment, and disconnection. By challenging this belief, you can open up space for more authentic self-expression and healthier family relationships.

What do you think about challenging this core belief and exploring how it might be impacting your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors?

Patient: I think it's a good idea to challenge this belief. It's been holding me back for so long, and I can see how it's affecting my mental health and relationships. I want to start exploring how it impacts my thoughts and feelings, but I'm not sure where to begin. Can you give me an example of how I might start gathering evidence to support a more balanced perspective?

Therapist: Certainly, Naomi. One way to start gathering evidence for a more balanced perspective is to look for experiences that contradict your core belief. For example, you mentioned that setting a boundary with your parents led to feelings of guilt and isolation. However, the boundary did have the effect of making you feel more heard and seen, even if it wasn't the outcome you hoped for. This suggests that challenging your family's expectations and advocating for your own needs can have positive effects, even if they're not immediate or what you initially expected.

Another way to gather evidence is to consider the impact of your core belief on your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This belief that you need to sacrifice your own needs to maintain family harmony might lead you to suppress your own identity and desires, which can lead to negative thoughts and feelings like guilt, resentment, and disconnection. By challenging this belief, you can open up space for more authentic self-expression and healthier family relationships.

We can work together to explore these experiences and identify evidence for a more balanced perspective. What do you think about that?

Patient: That sounds like a good approach, Nova. I can see how looking for experiences that contradict my core belief could help me start to challenge it. I'll try to think of more examples where asserting my identity or setting boundaries had positive effects, even if they weren't immediate.

I'm also curious about how this belief impacts my thoughts and feelings. Can you give me an example of how we might explore that?

Therapist: Sure, Naomi. Let's explore how this belief might impact your thoughts and feelings using an example from your life.

Imagine a situation where you're invited to a family gathering, but you're feeling drained and need some time to recharge on your own. Based on your core belief that you need to sacrifice your own needs to maintain family harmony, how might this belief impact your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors?

Patient: If I were invited to a family gathering and felt drained, my first thought might be, "I should go to make everyone happy, even if I'm exhausted." This thought would make me feel guilty for even considering not going. I'd probably end up going, but I'd feel resentful and disconnected because I'm not taking care of my own needs.

Therapist: That's a great example, Naomi. In this situation, your core belief that you need to sacrifice your own needs to maintain family harmony is impacting your thoughts and feelings. The thought, "I should go to make everyone happy," leads to feelings of guilt and resentment.

This is a great opportunity to practice some of the CBT techniques we've been working on, like thought challenging and behavioral activation. We can use this example to practice reframing your thoughts and engaging in self-care activities, even in the face of challenging situations.

First, let's practice thought challenging. Can you think of a more balanced or realistic thought to replace the belief, "I should go to make everyone happy, even if I'm exhausted"?

Patient: Hmm, a more balanced thought might be, "It's okay to prioritize my own needs and take care of myself, even if it means missing a family gathering. My well-being is important too." This thought would help me feel less guilty and more empowered to make a decision that's best for me.

Therapist: That's a great thought, Naomi. It's more balanced and realistic than the original belief because it acknowledges the importance of your well-being and the need to balance your needs with family obligations. This thought could lead to feelings of self-compassion and empowerment, which could make it easier to engage in self-care activities, like taking time to recharge.

Now, let's consider how you might practice behavioral activation in this situation. What are some self-care activities you could engage in to recharge and recharge, even if you do decide to go to the family gathering?

Patient: Some self-care activities I could engage in to recharge might include taking a short nap before the gathering, listening to some calming music, or even writing in my journal to express my feelings. These activities would help me feel more centered and prepared to handle the family gathering, even if I'm still feeling a bit drained.

Therapist: Those are great examples of self-care activities, Naomi. Taking a short nap, listening to calming music, or writing in your journal can all help you feel more centered and prepared to handle the family gathering, even if you're still feeling drained.

Another way to practice behavioral activation is to schedule these self-care activities into your daily routine, so they become a habit. You could set a reminder on your phone or create a routine that includes these activities, like a morning self-care routine or a bedtime relaxation routine.

What do you think about scheduling some self-care activities into your daily routine, even if you're feeling drained and need to prioritize your own needs?

Patient: I think scheduling self-care activities into my daily routine is a great idea. It would help me make self-care a priority and ensure that I'm taking care of myself, even when I'm feeling drained. I could set a reminder on my phone to take a short nap or listen to calming music, and I could also create a morning self-care routine that includes writing in my journal.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Naomi. Scheduling self-care activities into your daily routine can make it easier to prioritize your needs and maintain a sense of balance and well-being.

As you start to implement these changes, it's important to remember that it's okay to take small steps and be patient with yourself. It's not always easy to challenge long-held beliefs and change habits, but every small step counts.

I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in our work together, Naomi. You've been doing great work in understanding and challenging your core beliefs, and you're starting to take steps to prioritize your own needs and well-being. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

How are you feeling about our work today? Do you have any questions or concerns?

Patient: I feel good about our work today, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance as I continue to challenge my core beliefs and prioritize my own needs. I don't have any specific questions or concerns right now, but I'm looking forward to our next session and continuing to make progress.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling good about our work today, Naomi. Your progress is a testament to your hard work and commitment to your own well-being. Remember, change is a process, and every small step counts. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out.

As we wrap up today's session, I want to assign some homework to help you continue practicing the skills we've discussed. First, I'd like you to continue practicing the self-compassion phrases we've talked about, especially when you're dealing with challenging situations like the one we discussed today.

Second, I'd like you to practice scheduling some self-care activities into your daily routine, like taking a short nap, listening to calming music, or writing in your journal. Remember to be patient with yourself and celebrate the small wins along the way.

Finally, I'd like you to continue practicing the CBT triangle, breaking down the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in challenging situations. This will help you identify patterns and make more balanced choices going forward.
