Therapist: Welcome back, Alicia! It's great to see you again for our sixth session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever feel that you're in danger or need immediate assistance, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Lastly, since our communication is text-based, I can't observe or interpret non-verbal cues, which are important in traditional therapy. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. 

Let's start by checking in on how you've been doing since our last session. How has your emotional state been? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?

Patient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency.

Since our last session, my emotional state has been a bit of a rollercoaster. On the positive side, I've been trying to practice the thought records and self-compassion exercises you suggested. It's been challenging, but I think it's helping a little. I've noticed that when I catch myself spiraling into negative thoughts about my abilities as a team lead, I can sometimes pause and question the evidence behind those thoughts.

However, there have been some tough moments too. Last week, I had a particularly stressful meeting with my team. One of the junior developers made a mistake that could have been serious, and I felt a wave of self-doubt wash over me. I started questioning whether I was really cut out for this leadership role. It was hard not to take it personally.

Overall, I'd say my emotional intensity has been around a 7 out of 10, which is an improvement from the 8-9 I was feeling last time. But there's still a lot of work to do.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we discussed and that you're seeing some benefits, even if they're small. Questioning the evidence behind your negative thoughts is a crucial step in the process of change. It's not easy, but it's a significant step forward.

I'm sorry to hear about the stressful meeting with your team. It's not uncommon for leaders to experience self-doubt when things don't go as planned. Remember, your role is not to be perfect, but rather to guide and support your team in navigating challenges.

Given what you've shared, I'd like to propose the following agenda for today's session:

1. Explore the negative thoughts and self-doubt that came up during the stressful meeting with your team
2. Discuss strategies for managing stress and self-doubt in high-pressure situations
3. Review your thought records and discuss any challenges or insights
4. Introduce a new technique for challenging negative thoughts related to self-worth

How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I'm curious about the new technique for challenging negative thoughts related to self-worth. I think that's something I struggle with a lot, especially after the recent meeting. I often find myself thinking that my team doesn't respect me or that I don't deserve my position because I made a mistake. I'd definitely like to learn more about how to combat those thoughts.

Therapist: Great, I'm happy to explore that further. Before we dive into the new technique, let's start by looking at the stressful meeting with your team. Can you walk me through the situation and the thoughts and emotions that came up for you?

Patient: Sure. So, during the meeting, one of the junior developers accidentally pushed some untested code to the production environment. It caused a minor outage, which was quickly resolved, but it was still a big deal. When it happened, I immediately felt a rush of anxiety and self-doubt. I started thinking, "What if this happens again? What if they don't trust me to handle these situations? Maybe I'm not really cut out for this leadership role."

After the meeting, I felt really down on myself. I kept replaying the incident in my head and wondering if I should have caught the mistake earlier or if I should have been more prepared. It was hard not to take it personally and feel like a failure.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alicia. It sounds like the stressful situation at work triggered some familiar negative thoughts and feelings of self-doubt. When we have a major setback, it's common for our minds to automatically assume the worst-case scenario and start questioning our abilities.

Let's take a closer look at the thought "What if they don't trust me to handle these situations?" Can you think of any evidence that supports this thought?

Patient: Well, the evidence that comes to mind is the fact that the mistake happened on my watch. It feels like a failure on my part, even though I know it was an accident. I also worry that my team might see it as a sign that I'm not capable of leading them effectively. I can't help but think that if I were a better leader, this wouldn't have happened.

Therapist: I understand how it feels like a failure in the moment, but it's important to remember that mistakes are a part of the learning process. No one is perfect, and even the most experienced leaders make mistakes sometimes. Can you think of any evidence against the thought that you're not capable of leading your team effectively?

Patient: Hmm, that's a good question. I guess there's evidence that I have successfully led my team through other challenges. We've completed several projects on time and under budget, and I've received positive feedback from my superiors. I've also been able to mentor some of the junior developers and help them grow in their roles. So, there is evidence that I am capable of leading effectively, even if this one incident happened.

Therapist: Absolutely! Those are great examples of your leadership and competence. It's important to recognize that one incident doesn't define your entire worth as a leader. Let's try to reframe the thought in a more balanced way. Instead of "What if they don't trust me to handle these situations?" could you say something like, "Even though mistakes can happen, I have a track record of successfully navigating challenges and supporting my team.".

Patient: That makes sense. I can see how reframing the thought could help me feel less overwhelmed by the situation. Instead of focusing on the negative, I can remind myself of my past successes and the fact that I am capable of handling challenges. It's still hard to shake off the self-doubt, but I can see how this approach could be helpful in the long run.

Therapist: You've made a great point, Alicia. Challenging negative thoughts takes practice and persistence. It's okay if the self-doubt doesn't disappear completely at first. The important thing is that you're learning to question those thoughts and look at the situation from a different angle.

Now, I'd like to introduce a new technique that can help with negative thoughts related to self-worth. It's called the "Core Belief Worksheet." The goal of this technique is to identify and challenge deeply held beliefs that may be driving your negative thoughts and emotions. 

The worksheet has four main steps:

1. Identify the negative automatic thought that comes up for you in this situation.
2. Look for evidence that supports and refutes this thought.
3. Develop a more balanced and realistic thought based on the evidence.
4. Rate the intensity of the emotion before and after challenging the thought.

Would you be willing to try this technique with the example you shared about the stressful meeting?

Patient: Sure, I'm willing to give it a try. It sounds like a structured way to approach my negative thoughts and hopefully find a more balanced perspective. Let's start with the first step. The negative automatic thought that comes up for me is, "I'm not really cut out for this leadership role because I made a mistake."

Therapist: Okay, now let's look for evidence that supports and refutes this thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not cut out for the role?

Patient: The evidence that supports this thought is the recent mistake that happened on my watch. It feels like a failure, and I worry that my team might lose confidence in me. I also have a history of feeling like an imposter in my career, especially in leadership roles.

Therapist: And what evidence do you have that refutes the thought?

Patient: Well, there's evidence that I have successfully led my team through other challenges. We've completed several projects on time and under budget, and I've received positive feedback from my superiors. I've also been able to mentor some of the junior developers and help them grow in their roles. So, there is evidence that I am capable of leading effectively, even if this one incident happened.

Therapist: Great. Now, let's develop a more balanced and realistic thought based on the evidence. Instead of "I'm not really cut out for this leadership role because I made a mistake," could you come up with a different way of looking at the situation?

Patient: Hmm, maybe something like, "Even though I made a mistake, I have a track record of successfully navigating challenges and supporting my team. This incident doesn't define my entire worth as a leader."

Therapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic thought. It acknowledges the mistake but also recognizes your past successes and capabilities. Now, let's rate the intensity of the emotion before and after challenging the thought. How intense did the feeling of being "not cut out for the role" feel before we went through this process?

Patient: Before, it felt pretty intense, maybe an 8 out of 10. It was really weighing on me and making me question my abilities.

Therapist: And how intense does it feel now?

Patient: Now, it feels more manageable, maybe a 4 out of 10. I still feel some anxiety about it, but it's not as overwhelming. I can see that I have more evidence to support my capabilities as a leader.

Therapist: That's a significant reduction in intensity, which shows how powerful this technique can be. With practice, you'll likely find it easier to challenge negative thoughts about yourself and come up with more balanced perspectives.

Another important part of this technique is to examine the origins of these deeply held beliefs. Often, these beliefs can be traced back to early experiences or messages we received from others. By understanding where these beliefs come from, we can start to challenge their validity and develop more self-compassionate ways of thinking.

Do you feel comfortable exploring where some of these beliefs about your self-worth and leadership abilities might have come from?

Patient: I think it might have something to do with growing up in a community where success was often measured by how well you could fit into a certain mold. My parents always emphasized the importance of education and hard work, which I took to mean that I had to be perfect to be successful. Also, being one of the few women and Latinas in my field, I've always felt like I had to prove myself more than others.

Therapist: It's not uncommon for early experiences and cultural expectations to shape how we view ourselves. It's great that you're able to recognize how these factors may be influencing your thoughts and beliefs about leadership and self-worth.

As we continue to work together, we'll explore these origins further and develop more self-compassionate ways of relating to yourself. Remember, being a leader doesn't mean you have to be perfect or fit into a certain mold. It means you're taking responsibility and guiding others, even in challenging moments.

I'd like to give you some homework related to this technique. I'd like you to continue using the Core Belief Worksheet whenever you notice yourself having negative thoughts about your abilities or leadership role. Try to go through the steps as we did today, and practice finding more balanced and realistic thoughts based on the evidence.

Additionally, I encourage you to reflect on the origins of these negative beliefs and try to develop self-compassionate ways of relating to yourself. This can be challenging, but it's an important part of building self-esteem and resilience.

Patient: Okay, I'll give it a try. I'll keep using the Core Belief Worksheet and try to be more mindful of where these negative thoughts are coming from. It's definitely something I need to work on, especially with everything going on right now.

Therapist: You're doing great, Alicia. Remember, change takes time, and it's okay if it feels challenging at first. Keep practicing and be patient with yourself.

Before we wrap up, I want to check in on your current mood and see if you have any final thoughts or questions.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I feel a bit more hopeful after today's session. I guess my final thought would be that I need to remind myself more often that I'm not alone in feeling this way, and that it's okay to make mistakes as long as I learn from them.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Alicia. You're not alone in feeling this way, and you can reach out to others for support when you need it. Remember, building self-esteem and resilience is a process, and every small step counts.

I'm proud of the progress you've made today and throughout our work together. I'm confident that with continued practice and self-compassion, you'll see further improvements in your ability to challenge negative thoughts and build a more positive sense of self-worth.

For homework, continue using the Core Belief Worksheet and reflecting on the origins of your negative beliefs. We can further explore these themes in our next session.
