Therapist: Welcome back, Alicia! I'm glad to see you again for our 15th CBT session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few limitations as your AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How did you find our last session?

Patient: Hi, Nova. Thanks for the welcome. I appreciate the acknowledgment of your limitationsâ€”it's good to know what to expect.

Last session was helpful. I've been trying to implement those shorter breaks, but it's been tough. I still feel guilty when I take them, like I'm not doing enough. But I've noticed that I'm less burnt out by the end of the day, so there's that. I've also started journaling, which has been interesting. It's making me more aware of how often I push myself too hard.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you've been implementing the shorter breaks and noticing some benefits, even if it feels uncomfortable at times. Recognizing the guilt and pushback is an important insight. Journaling can be a powerful tool for building self-awareness. What about the thought challenging exercise we discussed? Were you able to practice that?

Patient: Yeah, I've been trying the thought challenging exercise. It's been eye-opening, actually. When I catch myself thinking, "I'm not productive enough," I try to counter it with, "Taking breaks helps me be more efficient in the long run." It's still a work in progress, but it's helping me see things differently.

Therapist: That's wonderful, Alicia. Challenging those long-held thoughts is a crucial part of changing the overall pattern. It's normal for it to feel difficult at first. Remember, we're building new mental habits here, and that takes time and practice.

Given what you've shared, I'd like to propose a few agenda items for today's session. First, let's review your homework and discuss any challenges or insights that came up. Then, I'd like to introduce a new technique called "behavioral activation" to help you engage in more rewarding activities. We can also explore how your thoughts and beliefs might be impacting your ability to set boundaries and prioritize self-care. What do you think about that plan?

Patient: That sounds good. Let's start with reviewing the homework. I've been trying to leave the office on time at least three days a week, but it's been tough. I ended up staying late more often than not. I feel like I'm letting my team down if I'm not there to support them. But I did manage to take those 5-minute breaks consistently, which helped a bit.

As for the journaling, it's been interesting. I noticed that I tend to focus on the negative aspects of my day, like the times I felt like I wasn't productive enough. I'm trying to balance that with positive reflections, like the times I did manage to take a break or leave on time.

Therapist: Thanks for sharing that, Alicia. It's common to have mixed feelings about setting boundaries, especially when you're used to staying late and pushing yourself. That guilt and fear of letting others down are important thoughts to explore.

The insight you gained from journaling is valuable too. It's great that you're starting to recognize the negative thought patterns that contribute to your stress. Balancing the negative with the positive is an essential part of building a more balanced perspective.

Given what you've shared, I'm wondering if we could focus on two main areas in today's session. First, let's explore the thoughts and beliefs that are making it challenging for you to leave the office on time. We could also discuss strategies for setting boundaries and managing those feelings of guilt. In the second part, we can review your experience with the thought challenging exercise and behavioral activation, and discuss any adjustments or additions you might need. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. Let's start with exploring the thoughts and beliefs that make it hard for me to leave the office on time. I think it's mostly the fear of not being seen as a good leader if I'm not there all the time. I worry that my team will think I'm not committed or that I'm not doing enough.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alicia. Those fears and beliefs can be really powerful in holding us back from setting healthy boundaries. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me about a specific situation recently where you felt the need to stay late at work, and what thoughts and feelings came up for you around leaving on time?

Patient: Sure. Last week, we had a big project deadline. I stayed late every night that week, even though I knew I should leave on time. I kept thinking, "If I leave now, the team will think I'm not serious about this project." I felt anxious and guilty every time I considered leaving early. It was like I was trapped in this cycle of overworking to prove my dedication.

Therapist: That's a really powerful example of how those thoughts and beliefs can drive our feelings and actions. It sounds like you were experiencing some cognitive distortions there, like mind reading and magnification. Mind reading is when we assume we know what others are thinking, like when you thought the team would think you're not serious. Magnification is when we blow things up in our minds, like feeling trapped in the cycle of overworking.

Let's challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that your team thinks you're not serious or dedicated to your work if you leave on time?

Patient: I don't have any direct evidence that they think that. In fact, I've gotten positive feedback from my team about my leadership and dedication. It's more of a fear based on my own insecurities, I guess. I just feel like I need to constantly prove myself, especially as a Latina in a leadership role.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Alicia. It sounds like your own insecurities and fears are driving some of those thoughts, even though they're not based on evidence. That's a common experience, especially for people who have held themselves to high standards for a long time.

Let's look at the other side. What are some of the evidence for your dedication and effectiveness as a leader?

Patient: Well, I've been promoted to team lead, which is a big achievement. My team has been meeting deadlines and delivering high-quality work. I've also received positive feedback from my manager and peers about my leadership skills. So, there's a lot of evidence that I'm a dedicated and effective leader.

Therapist: Absolutely. Those are all great indicators of your leadership skills and effectiveness. It's important to give those experiences and feedback the weight they deserve.

Now, let's reframe those initial thoughts in a more balanced way. Instead of assuming the team will think you're not serious or dedicated, what if you consider the evidence of your actual effectiveness and the positive feedback you've received? How does that change your thoughts about leaving on time?

Patient: If I focus on the positive feedback and my actual achievements, it makes it easier to see that leaving on time doesn't mean I'm not dedicated. It just means I'm managing my time better and setting a healthy example for my team. It's still hard to break the habit, but it feels more reasonable when I think about it that way.

Therapist: That's a great reframe, Alicia. You're acknowledging the reality of your achievements and feedback, and using that as evidence to challenge the distorted thoughts. That's a key part of cognitive restructuring.

As you continue to practice this, it will start to feel more automatic. It's like building a new mental habit, which takes time and repetition.

Given what you've shared, I'd like to propose a few strategies for setting boundaries and managing the guilt and anxiety around leaving work. First, you can start by setting small, specific goals for yourself, like leaving at 5:30pm three times this week. You can also communicate those boundaries to your team, so they know it's not a sign of you not being dedicated or committed. And use those balanced thoughts we discussed to challenge any guilty thoughts that come up. What do you think about that approach?

Patient: I think setting small, specific goals is a good idea. It feels more manageable than trying to change everything at once. I can start with leaving at 5:30pm three times this week and see how it goes. Communicating those boundaries to my team is also important. I'll let them know that I'm trying to set a healthier work-life balance and that it doesn't mean I'm any less committed to our projects.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Alicia. Setting small, specific goals and communicating your intentions is a great way to ease into this process. And remember, it's okay if you don't meet every goal perfectly. The important thing is that you're taking steps towards a healthier work-life balance and challenging the distorted thoughts that keep you stuck in the cycle of overworking.

As you practice setting boundaries and managing guilt, keep track of your experiences and observations. You can use your journaling to reflect on how it feels to prioritize your own needs and challenge the old thoughts. And don't forget to use those balanced thoughts we discussed, like focusing on the evidence of your effectiveness and positive feedback.

Patient: I'll definitely keep track of how it feels to set these boundaries and challenge those old thoughts. It's still a bit daunting, but I know it's important for my well-being. I'll also make sure to use the balanced thoughts we talked about to help me through it. Thanks for the support, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad we've been able to explore these thoughts and beliefs together and develop a plan for moving forward. Remember, change takes time and practice, but every small step counts. Keep up the great work.

Before we wrap up, let's review your homework for this week. You'll continue to practice the 5-minute breaks at work, leave the office at 5:30pm on at least three days, and keep up with your journaling to reflect on your experiences and practice challenging those distorted thoughts. If you have any questions or challenges come up during the week, feel free to bring them to the next session.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'll make sure to do the homework and keep practicing. I'll also keep an eye on any challenges that come up and bring them to the next session. I appreciate your help.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Before we end, let's take a moment to check in. How are you feeling about the progress we've made today and the plan we've set for the week?

Patient: I feel a bit more confident about the plan we've set. It's still challenging, but having specific goals and knowing I can rely on the balanced thoughts we discussed makes it feel more manageable. I'm ready to give it a try and see how it goes.

Therapist: That's great to hear, Alicia. It's normal to feel some anxiety or doubt, but it's wonderful that you're feeling more confident and prepared. Remember, you've already made some important changes and insights, and you're building a strong foundation for further growth.

I'm really proud of the work you've been doing, and I'm excited to see how you'll continue to apply these skills and strategies. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up?

Patient: No, I think I'm good for now. I'll focus on the homework and see how it goes. Thanks again, Nova. I'll see you next week.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next week and continuing to support you on this journey. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself.
