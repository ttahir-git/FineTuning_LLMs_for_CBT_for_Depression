Therapist: Welcome back, Derek. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last session. It's essential that we build upon the progress we've made so far. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I provide may be inaccurate. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever feel that you're in danger or need immediate assistance, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues, so I'll be relying on your written communication to understand your thoughts and emotions. With that said, let's continue with today's session.

Patient: Alright, Nova. I'm here. Just so you know, I'm not in any immediate danger or anything like that. I'm just trying to figure out how to get through each day without feeling like a complete failure. So, what do you want to talk about today?

Therapist: I understand, Derek. That's why we're here. Let's start by reviewing your homework from our last session. Were you able to monitor and challenge your negative thoughts related to woodworking?

Patient: Yeah, I did that. I kept a journal, like you suggested. It wasn't easy, but I wrote down some of the thoughts that popped up when I tried to work on a small project. Stuff like, "I'm too old to learn new tricks," or "What's the point? It'll never be as good as it used to be."

Therapist: Those are great examples, Derek. Did you find it helpful to write down those thoughts and challenge them in the moment?

Patient: It was something, I guess. I mean, it's hard to shake those thoughts completely. But writing them down made me realize how often I was beating myself up over nothing.

Therapist: That's a really significant insight, Derek. Recognizing that pattern is a crucial step in changing it. Let's talk about the self-compassion practice. When did you try that, and what happened?

Patient: I tried it a couple of times. When I caught myself thinking, "I'm too old to learn new tricks," I told myself, "It's okay, Derek. You're doing your best." It felt weird at first, but it did help a bit.

Therapist: It's great that you were willing to try it, Derek. It can feel uncomfortable at first, especially if we're not used to talking to ourselves kindly. But with practice, it gets easier, and it can make a big difference in how we feel. Did the same experience arise for you this week, when you worked on the small woodworking project?

Patient: Yeah, I did a small projectâ€”just a simple birdhouse. I kept reminding myself to be kind, but I still got frustrated when it didn't turn out perfect. I guess I need more practice with this self-compassion thing.

Therapist: You're right, Derek. It takes practice, just like anything else. And it's okay if it's challenging. Remember, we're not trying to get rid of negative thoughts altogether. We're just learning to relate to them differently. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought, "It's not perfect." What might be some evidence for that thought?

Patient: Well, the birdhouse isn't as polished as I'd like it to be. There are some rough edges and a couple of small mistakes.

Therapist: Okay, that's good to know. And what about evidence against the thought? What might you be overlooking?

Patient: I guess it's functional. Birds can still use it, and it's not falling apart. Plus, it's something I made with my own hands, which is more than I could do a few months ago.

Therapist: Absolutely. That's really significant. You're acknowledging the skills you have and the effort you put in, which are important pieces of the evidence against that negative thought. Now, let's try reframing that thought with a compassionate alternative. What's a different way you could look at the birdhouse?

Patient: Maybe I could think, "It's not perfect, but it's good enough. I did my best, and that's what matters."

Therapist: That's a great reframe, Derek. And it's a more balanced, realistic way of looking at your project. Remember, part of being compassionate is giving ourselves credit for our efforts and progress, not just our outcomes. How do you feel about that?

Patient: I feel a bit better about it. It's still hard to let go of that perfectionist mindset, but I see what you're getting at.

Therapist: It's great that you're seeing the value in that, Derek. It's not about letting go of perfectionism completely, but about finding a healthier way to relate to your own work and standards. It's a process, and we'll keep working on it together. Now, let's talk about your behavioral activation plan. How did it go with engaging in activities?

### Conversation:.

Patient: I managed to go fishing last weekend. It was tough getting out there, but once I was on the water, it felt a bit like old times. Caught a couple of small bass, nothing big.

Therapist: That's a great example of engaging in an activity that has the potential to improve your mood, Derek. Going fishing, even if it didn't go as well as you hoped, is still a step forward. How did you feel afterward, and how did you feel afterward?

Patient: I felt a bit more relaxed afterward. The fresh air and being out on the water helped clear my head. But then I started thinking about how I used to catch bigger fish, and that brought me back down.

Therapist: It's okay. It's natural for our thoughts to go in different directions after an activity. The important thing is that you got out there and did it. That's what we're aiming for. Let's talk about your thought about fishing. It sounds like you had a bit of a negative thought about not catching bigger fish. Let's look at that thought a bit more closely. What evidence do you have for and against the thought, "I should be catching bigger fish"?

Patient: Well, the evidence for it is that I used to catch bigger fish all the time. The evidence against it is that I haven't been fishing in a while, and my skills might have gotten rusty. Plus, the weather and water conditions weren't perfect.

Therapist: Great analysis, Derek. You're looking at the situation from a more balanced perspective. Now, let's try to come up with an alternative thought that's more helpful. What's a different way to look at the situation that's more balanced and realistic?

Patient: I guess I could say, "I got out there and tried, and that's what counts. The bigger fish will come with time and practice." It's not about the size of the fish, but about getting back into something I used to enjoy.

Therapist: That's a great alternative thought, Derek. It acknowledges your effort and enjoyment, not just the size of the fish. That's a healthier way to look at the situation, and it can help you keep perspective as you continue to engage in the activity. Remember, the goal is not to be the best fisherman, but to find joy and fulfillment in the process. How does that feel?

Patient: It feels a bit more manageable. I can focus on getting back into it without putting so much pressure on myself. Thanks for the help, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm glad that feels helpful. Remember, we're not trying to change the situation to be perfect or something we want it to be. We're just looking at it from a more realistic, balanced perspective. That can help reduce the negative thoughts and feelings that can get in the way of enjoyment. As you continue to practice this, it'll get easier to find that perspective more often. Now, let's talk about your journaling and thought monitoring. Did you find that helpful in noticing patterns of negative thoughts?

Patient: Yeah, I did start journaling a bit more. I noticed that a lot of my thoughts are about how I'm not good enough or how things used to be better. It's like I'm stuck in the past.

Therapist: That's a really insightful observation, Derek. You're starting to recognize some of the common negative thought patterns that can contribute to depression. This is really important. As we continue to work together, we'll be using some techniques to help challenge those thoughts and find more balanced, realistic ways of thinking. One of those techniques is called cognitive restructuring, which involves examining the evidence for and against our negative thoughts, like we did with your woodworking thought. Another technique is called thought records, where we write down the situation, thoughts, emotions, and outcomes to help identify patterns and make them more clear. These techniques can be really helpful in managing negative thoughts and improving mood. What do you think about trying these techniques, Derek?

Patient: I'm willing to give it a shot. It sounds like it could help me get a better handle on these thoughts. I just hope it doesn't feel too complicated.

Therapist: It's not complicated, Derek. I'll explain it more in depth, and we'll practice together so that it feels more comfortable. Remember, like anything else, it's a skill that takes practice. The more you do it, the more natural it will feel. And we'll work through it together. The goal is to help you develop a toolkit of skills you can use to manage negative thoughts and improve your mood. It might take some time, but I'm confident you can do it. What's your thought about that?

Patient: Alright, I'm in. Let's get started. I'm ready to learn this stuff and see if it makes a difference.

Therapist: That's great, Derek. I'm glad you're open to learning these skills. Let's start with cognitive restructuring. This is a way to challenge negative thoughts and find more balanced, realistic alternatives. We'll use a thought record to guide us. A thought record typically includes columns for the situation, emotions, negative thoughts, evidence for and against the thought, an alternative thought, and the outcome. We'll fill in each column as we go. Does that make sense so far?

Patient: Yeah, it makes sense. Let's start with an example. What situation should we use?

Therapist: Great. Let's start with the situation of you working on the birdhouse last week. What emotions did you feel during that situation and after?

Patient: I felt frustrated and disappointed. I kept thinking I wasn't good enough at woodworking anymore.

Therapist: Okay, so the emotions were frustration and disappointment, and the negative thought was, "I'm not good enough at woodworking anymore." Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the thought?

Patient: Well, the birdhouse didn't turn out as well as I wanted. It was wobbly and the paint job was sloppy.

Therapist: And what evidence do you have that goes against the thought?

Patient: I've built plenty of birdhouses before that turned out fine. I just need more practice and maybe some better tools.

Therapist: Great. So, the evidence against the thought is that you've had successes with birdhouses before, and it could be that you need more practice and better tools. Now, let's come up with an alternative thought that takes both sides into account. What's a more balanced way to look at the situation?

Patient: Maybe I can say, "I've done this before and I can do it again with some practice and better tools."

Therapist: That's a great alternative thought, Derek. It acknowledges your past successes and gives credit to the factors that can improve your results. Now, let's look at the outcome. How did you feel after coming up with this alternative thought?

Patient: I felt a bit better, less defeated. It's still frustrating, but at least I know I can improve.

Therapist: That's really good to hear. The goal is to find a more balanced perspective that helps you feel more empowered to take action. As you practice this technique, you'll start to notice patterns in your thoughts and how they impact your emotions and behaviors. This can help you make more intentional choices about how you want to engage with the situation. How does that sound?

Patient: It sounds like a lot of work, but I guess it's worth a try.

Therapist: It does involve some work, but you don't have to do it alone. We'll be practicing together, and we can break it down into smaller steps. And remember, it's not about being perfect. Every time you practice, you're building a skill that you can use to manage negative thoughts and improve your mood. The more you do it, the more natural it will feel.

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a shot. But don't expect miracles overnight.
