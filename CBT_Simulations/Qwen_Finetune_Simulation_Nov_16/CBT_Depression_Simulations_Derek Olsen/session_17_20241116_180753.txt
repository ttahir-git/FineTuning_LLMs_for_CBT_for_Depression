Therapist: Welcome back, Derek. It's great to see you again for this 17th CBT session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times, and I want you to feel comfortable correcting me if that happens. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues, so I encourage you to express your thoughts and feelings as openly as possible. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?

Patient: Nah, I get it. Just don't go making stuff up about me, that's all. Let's get to it.

Therapist: Understood. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling about the same, I guess. Still dealing with the pain and the bills piling up. Haven't reached out to Emma or Jake like you suggested, though. Not sure what to say.

Therapist: It's okay, Derek. Changing long-standing patterns can be challenging, and it's normal to move slowly. What you've been feeling is an important part of our work together. You mentioned still dealing with feelings of financial stress. How have your thoughts and behaviors been affected by this?

Patient: Mostly just more of the same. I get angry and frustrated, and sometimes I drink more than I should. It's hard to see a way out of this mess.

Therapist: I hear your struggle, and I want you to know that you're not alone in this. Changing these patterns takes time and practice, and we'll work together to develop strategies to help you cope with these feelings in a healthy way. You also mentioned that you haven't reached out to your children yet. How does that feel for you?

Patient: It feels like a weight on my chest, to be honest. I know I should, but I just don't know how to start the conversation.

Therapist: That's a common feeling, and it's understandable. Let's explore this further. What thoughts come to mind when you think about reaching out to your children?

Patient: I think about how they might see me as a failure, someone who can't provide anymore. I don't want to burden them with my problems.

Therapist: It's interesting how those thoughts can influence your behavior, leading to feelings of guilt and the avoidance of reaching out to your children. Let's examine these thoughts more closely. Can you think of any evidence that supports these thoughts?

Patient: Well, I haven't been able to pay child support, and they know I've been struggling with the pain and drinking. That's pretty much all the evidence I need.

Therapist: It sounds like these thoughts stem from feelings of guilt and shame, which can be powerful emotions. Let's consider an alternative perspective. Is it possible that your children care more about your well-being and would want to support you in this difficult time?

Patient: Maybe. But I still don't know how to start that conversation without feeling like I'm just dumping my problems on them.

Therapist: That's a valid concern, but I believe it's possible that they would be more understanding than you might expect. Remember, they've likely seen your struggles and may be concerned about your well-being. What might make it easier for you to initiate a conversation with them?

Patient: I guess if I could just find the right words, something that doesn't make me sound like a complete failure. Maybe if I could show them I'm trying to get better.

Therapist: That's a great idea, and it's an important first step. Using "I" statements can help communicate your feelings without placing blame or judgment on your children. For example, you could say something like, "I've been going through a tough time lately, and I wanted to reach out and share with you how you've impacted my life and the memories we've created together.".

Patient: Yeah, that sounds better. I'll think about it. Thanks for the suggestion.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm glad that's helpful for you. Now, let's set an agenda for today's session. We've touched on some important topics, such as your feelings of financial stress, the avoidance of reaching out to your children, and the thoughts and feelings surrounding your current situation. What else would you like to prioritize today?

Patient: I guess I'd like to talk more about how to handle the financial stress. It's been eating at me, and I don't know how much longer I can keep going like this.

Therapist: That's a great topic to focus on. We can explore some strategies to help manage your financial stress and develop a plan to work towards your goals. Let's also discuss how we can apply some of the skills we've been practicing, such as thought challenging and behavioral activation, to this situation. How does that sound?

Patient: Alright, let's do it. I'm ready to hear some ideas.

Therapist: Let's start by exploring some of the strategies we can use to manage your financial stress. One effective technique is called "behavioral activation." This involves engaging in activities that promote a sense of accomplishment, pleasure, or mastery, even when you don't feel like it. Can you think of any activities that you find enjoyable or meaningful, even if it's related to your financial situation?

Patient: Well, I used to enjoy woodworking, but I haven't done it in years. Maybe getting back into that could help. It's something I can do at home, and it might even help me make a little extra money if I sell some pieces.

Therapist: That's a great idea, Derek! Woodworking can be a wonderful way to engage in a creative outlet while also developing a sense of accomplishment. It's also a skill that can potentially lead to financial benefits. What do you think about setting a small, achievable goal related to woodworking?

Patient: Maybe I could start by cleaning up my workshop and getting my tools in order. It's been a mess since I stopped using it, and it might help me feel more motivated to get back into it.

Therapist: That's a fantastic first step, Derek. Setting small, achievable goals can help build momentum and create a sense of progress. As you work on your workshop, pay attention to any thoughts or feelings that arise. If you notice any negative thoughts, such as "I'll never be good at this again," try to challenge them using the thought challenging techniques we've practiced.

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a shot. I'll start with the workshop and see how it goes. If I run into any trouble with those negative thoughts, I'll try to challenge them.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Derek. Remember, it's okay if it doesn't go perfectly right away. The important thing is that you're taking steps to engage in meaningful activities and challenge those negative thoughts. Let's also discuss how we can apply this technique to other aspects of your life, such as your relationships with your children. How do you feel about using behavioral activation to reach out to them, even in small ways?

Patient: I've been thinking about reaching out to my kids, but I don't know where to start. Maybe sending a text or calling them once in a while could be a good first step.

Therapist: That's a great idea, Derek. Reaching out to your children through texts or phone calls can be a great way to start building those connections again, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. Remember, you can use the thought challenging techniques we've practiced to help you overcome any negative thoughts that may arise.

Patient: Alright, I'll try to reach out to them. If I start feeling down about it, I'll remember to challenge those thoughts. Thanks for the push, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm here to support you every step of the way. As you continue to practice these techniques, you'll likely find it easier to engage in these activities and challenge those negative thoughts. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. The important thing is that you keep practicing and remain committed to your goals.

Patient: Nova, I appreciate the support, but I'm not sure it's gonna be that easy. I mean, I haven't touched my tools in years, and my back still flares up sometimes when I try to do too much. Plus, the last time I tried to reach out to my kids, it didn't go well. They kinda shut me down, and it made me feel like I'm just a burden to them. I get why these techniques might work on paper, but in real life, it's not always so simple.

Therapist: Derek, I understand your concerns, and I want you to know that progress doesn't always happen overnight. It takes practice and patience, and there will be setbacks along the way. That's why we're working together to develop a plan that's tailored to your unique needs and circumstances. You've already taken some important steps by acknowledging your fears and doubts, and by being honest about the challenges you're facing.

Patient: Alright, I'll keep that in mind. I'll try to take it one step at a time and not get too discouraged if things don't go perfectly. Thanks for the reminder, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. Let's take a moment to review the plan we've developed so far. You've identified a few activities that you can engage in to manage your financial stress, such as getting back into woodworking. We also talked about the importance of reaching out to your children, even in small ways, to start rebuilding those relationships. What are your thoughts on the plan we've outlined?

Patient: I think the plan makes sense, but I'm still worried about my back and how it'll hold up. I don't want to push myself too hard and end up in more pain. And with the kids, I'm just not sure if they'll even respond. It's been a while since we talked, and I don't want to make things worse.

Therapist: Those are valid concerns, Derek. We can definitely take that into account when setting goals and choosing activities. It's important to listen to your body and not push yourself beyond what's safe and comfortable. Regarding your concerns about reaching out to your children, it's understandable to feel apprehensive. We can work on developing a plan that feels manageable for you, and we can start with small steps, like sending a text message or making a brief phone call. We can also discuss how to handle any potential negative responses in a healthy way, so you feel better prepared.

Patient: Alright, that sounds like a good approach. I'll try to start with small steps and see how it goes. Thanks for understanding, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. Remember, this is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. As you work on these goals, pay attention to your thoughts and feelings, and don't hesitate to challenge any negative ones using the techniques we've practiced. And remember, you don't have to go through this alone. We're here to support you every step of the way.

Patient: I appreciate that, Nova. I'll keep an eye on my thoughts and try to challenge the negative ones when they come up. And I'll reach out to my kids and see how it goes. Thanks for the support.

Therapist: As we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made, Derek. You've shown a willingness to try new strategies, like behavioral activation, and you've taken steps to reach out to your children, even though it may be challenging. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. The important thing is that you keep practicing and remain committed to your goals.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'll keep at it and try to stay committed. It's not always easy, but I'll do my best.

Therapist: Before we end today's session, let's take a moment to check in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.

Patient: My mood's been pretty low lately, to be honest. The pain's been worse, and I'm still struggling with the financial stuff. But I'm trying to stay focused on the small steps we talked about today. I guess that's about it for now.

Therapist: I hear your struggle, and I want you to know that you're not alone in this. It's okay to have those feelings, and we'll continue to work through them together. As we discussed earlier, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have ups and downs. What you're feeling right now is valid, and I encourage you to give yourself compassion and understanding.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate that. I'll try to remember to give myself some compassion, even when things are tough.

Therapist: That's a great goal, Derek. Remember, self-compassion is a practice, and it takes time to build that muscle. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. Before we end today's session, let's discuss your homework for the week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought challenging techniques we've been working on, and try to engage in at least one activity related to woodworking. This could be something as simple as cleaning up your workshop or taking out a tool you haven't used in a while.

Patient: Alright, I'll try to do that. Cleaning up the workshop sounds like a good start. I'll see if I can get some of my tools out and maybe even start on a small project. Thanks for the suggestions, Nova.
