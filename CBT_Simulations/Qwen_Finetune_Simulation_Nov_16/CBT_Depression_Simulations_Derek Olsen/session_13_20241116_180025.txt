Therapist: Welcome back, Derek! It's great to see you again for our 13th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Finally, since our interactions are text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues.

With that said, let's start by checking in on how you've been doing since our last session. How have you been feeling, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling about the same, I guess. Still dealing with the pain, and not much has changed on that front. I did start gathering some materials for that shelf project, but I haven't really gotten into it yet. The thought record thing, I tried it a couple of times, but it feels kind of forced. I don't know, maybe I'm just not cut out for this kind of stuff.

Therapist: Derek, I want to acknowledge the effort you've put into trying these techniques, even though you don't feel they're coming naturally to you. It's okay if they feel a bit forced at first â€“ that's a common experience for many people when they're first learning and practicing new skills. I also want to gently point out that self-criticism, like what you've experienced with the thought record, can actually make the process more difficult and less effective.

That being said, I'm here to support you in building these skills, even if it feels challenging at times. Let's explore what got in the way of you engaging with the thought record, and see if we can find ways to make it feel more relevant and helpful for you.

Patient: Yeah, I guess I just feel like it's not really helping. Like, I write down my thoughts, but then what? It doesn't change how I feel. And I don't know, maybe I'm just too old to start learning new tricks. I've been dealing with my problems my own way for a long time, and this feels like it's just another thing I'm failing at.

Therapist: Derek, thank you for sharing that. It seems like you're feeling quite discouraged and doubtful about the thought record technique, as well as about your own abilities. I want to acknowledge those feelings and thoughts as valid experiences, and I want to help you see how our work together can be a space for exploring and developing new ways of relating to your thoughts and feelings.

When you mentioned feeling like you're failing, what thoughts came up for you in response to that? What do those thoughts feel like in your body and in your behavior?

Patient: When I think about failing, it feels like a weight on my chest, like I can't catch my breath. My shoulders get tight, and I just want to shut down. I start thinking about all the things I used to be able to do, and how I can't do them anymore. It's like I'm not the man I used to be, and that's hard to accept.

Therapist: Derek, you've shared a lot about the difficult thoughts and feelings that come up when you think you're failing. I want to help you see that those thoughts and feelings are actually separate from the fact that you're human, and that everyone makes mistakes and faces challenges. It doesn't mean you're not the man you've always been, which is the core of who you are.

When you're feeling that way, what do you usually do? Do you withdraw or avoid doing things altogether?

Patient: Yeah, I usually just shut down. I don't want to do anything, don't want to talk to anyone. I just sit there, watching TV or drinking, trying to numb out the pain and the thoughts. It's like I'm just waiting for the day to be over, you know?

Therapist: I can understand why you might turn to numbing behaviors when you're feeling overwhelmed. It's a way of avoiding the pain, even if it's not ultimately helpful. I want to suggest that we start to explore other options for coping with those thoughts and feelings, and to help you develop a more balanced relationship with your emotions.

When you're feeling that way, I wonder if you could try just sitting with it for a moment, without trying to change anything. Just observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment, and see what they do in response to that. It's a way of practicing self-compassion and curiosity.

Patient: I don't know, Nova. Sitting with it just sounds like torture. I mean, why would I want to just sit there and feel all that pain and frustration? It's not like it's going to make anything better.

Therapist: I hear you, and I can see how sitting with your thoughts and feelings might feel counterintuitive at first. But in fact, by avoiding them, you're actually reinforcing the belief that they're too painful to handle. Sitting with them, even for a short time, can actually help you learn that they're not as powerful as they might feel in the moment.

When you're feeling overwhelmed, I wonder if you could try a technique called "thought watching." It's like the sitting with your thoughts, but with a more structured approach. It involves observing your thoughts without judgment, and then gently questioning them to see if there might be another way to look at the situation.

For example, if you're thinking "I'm not the man I used to be," you could ask yourself, "Is that really true? What does it mean to be a man, anyway? Are there other parts of myself that define me?".

Patient: Thought watching, huh? That sounds like a lot of work. I don't know if I'm up for it. I mean, I've been dealing with my thoughts my own way for so long, and it's not like it's gotten me anywhere. Why should this be any different?

Therapist: I hear your hesitation, Derek. It's true that you've been using your own strategies to manage your thoughts, and that change can be difficult and uncomfortable at times. I want to acknowledge that thought watching isn't meant to be a quick fix, but rather a way of learning to relate to your thoughts in a different way.

When you're feeling overwhelmed by your thoughts, they can feel like the only reality, even if they're not actually true. Thought watching is a way of slowing down and inviting a different perspective. It's not about changing your thoughts overnight, but rather about developing a more flexible and balanced relationship with them.

Patient: I guess I can try it. But I don't know if it'll make a difference. I've been stuck in this rut for so long, and it's hard to see a way out.

Therapist: I understand, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to try something new, even when you're not sure it will work. I also want to remind you that change is possible, even if it feels slow and difficult at times. Every small step you take is a step closer to feeling better, and every time you practice thought watching, you're building a new skill that you can use to manage your thoughts in a more effective way.

As you start to practice thought watching, you'll likely notice that your thoughts don't have the same power over you as they used to. You'll start to see them as just thoughts, not necessarily as the truth. And you'll find that you have more options for responding to them, rather than just feeling like you have to do what they say.

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a shot. But I'm not making any promises. I've been let down before, and I don't want to get my hopes up.

Therapist: I hear your wariness, Derek, and I want to reassure you that I'm not asking you to set unrealistic goals for yourself. You're learning new skills, and that takes time and practice. I'm just asking you to try, and to be patient with yourself in the process.

When you're starting out with thought watching, it might be helpful to set aside a specific time each day to practice. It could be as simple as taking 10 minutes in the morning or evening to sit quietly, observe your thoughts without judgment, and then gently question them if they feel particularly strong or unhelpful.

Remember, you don't have to do this perfectly, and it's okay to have days when it feels harder than other days. The important thing is that you keep trying, and that you're willing to learn from the experience.

Patient: Alright, I'll try it. But I'm not promising anything. I'll set aside some time each day, maybe in the morning, and see if it helps. But if it doesn't, I'm not going to keep beating myself up over it.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to give it a try, Derek, and I appreciate your honesty about your expectations. Remember, you don't have to be perfect at this, and it's okay if it feels challenging at times. I'm here to support you, and I'm confident that with practice, you'll start to notice some changes in the way you relate to your thoughts.

I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself in the process, and to remember that every small step you take is a step closer to feeling better. You don't have to do this alone, and you don't have to do it perfectly. Just try your best, and be patient with yourself in the process.

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a shot. But I'm not making any promises. I'll try to be patient with myself, but it's not easy. I've been through a lot, and it's hard to see a way out sometimes.

Therapist: I understand, Derek, and I want to acknowledge the pain you've been through and the challenges you've faced. It's not easy to see a way out when you've been feeling stuck for so long. But I want to encourage you to remember that every small step you take is a step closer to feeling better, and that you don't have to do this alone.

And you'll find that you have more options for responding to them, rather than just feeling like you have to do what they say.

I want to remind you that you have the strength and resilience to get through this, and that you don't have to do it all at once. Every small step you take is a step closer to feeling better, and every time you practice thought watching, you're building a new skill that you can use to manage your thoughts in a more effective way.

Patient: I hear what you're saying, but it's hard to believe that just thinking about my thoughts differently will make a difference. I've been dealing with this pain and these feelings for years. It feels like there's no way out. And I don't really know how to start this "thought watching" stuff. Can you give me an example of what you mean? Maybe something more concrete?

Therapist: Absolutely, Derek. Thought watching is a technique that involves observing your thoughts without judgment, and then gently questioning them to see if there might be another way to look at the situation.

For example, let's say you have the thought "I'm not good enough." When you have that thought, instead of getting caught up in it and believing it as if it were the truth, you observe it with curiosity. You might say to yourself "I notice the thought that I'm not good enough," and then you gently question that thought. "Is that really true? What evidence do I have that I'm not good enough? What would I tell a friend who was saying that about themselves?"

You might find that the evidence against the thought "I'm not good enough" is much stronger than you first thought. And you might come up with a more balanced thought, like "I may not be perfect, but I am good enough as I am. I have a lot to offer, even if I have challenges."

That's the essence of thought watching - observing your thoughts without judgment, and then gently questioning them to find a more balanced perspective. It's not about changing your thoughts overnight, but rather about building a more flexible and balanced relationship with them.

Patient: Alright, I get what you're saying. It's like stepping back and looking at my thoughts like they're just words, not facts. But it's hard to do that when you're in the middle of feeling like you're not good enough. I'll try to remember to question those thoughts, but it's not going to be easy. I've been telling myself I'm not good enough for so long, it's like a habit now.

Therapist: You're right, Derek. Questioning long-held beliefs and thought patterns is not easy, especially when they feel like habits. It takes time, practice, and a willingness to challenge yourself. And it's okay if it feels difficult at first. That's part of the learning process.
