Therapist: Derek, thank you for sharing that update on your homework progress. I'm glad to hear that you've been making efforts to connect with your children and engage in self-care activities. I'm also glad that you're starting to recognize the controllable aspects of your relationships and the importance of small, consistent steps towards change.

As we continue our work together, I want to encourage you to keep building on these insights and progress. Remember that setbacks and challenges are a normal part of the process, and that we can use these opportunities to learn and grow.

In today's session, I'd like to suggest a few new homework tasks to help you continue building on the skills we've been working on. What do you think about trying some of these activities as part of your practice between our sessions?

Patient: Yeah, I've been trying to reach out to Emma and Jake, but it's not easy. They don't always respond, and it feels like I'm just bothering them. As for the self-care stuff, I did some woodworking last week. It felt good to get my hands dirty again, even if it was just for a little while.

What kind of new homework tasks are you thinking about? I'm not sure I'm up for anything too complicated right now.

Therapist: That's a good point, Derek. I want to make sure that the homework tasks we suggest are accessible and relevant to you. Based on what you've shared, I thought we could try a few things related to reaching out to your children and continuing to practice self-care.

One idea is to set aside a specific time each day to connect with one of your children, whether that's calling Emma in the evening or spending some quality time with Jake on the weekends. We can also explore some new self-care activities that might be more enjoyable for you.

For example, you mentioned that you used to enjoy playing music. Could you try setting aside 15 minutes a day to just play an instrument or listen to music without judgment, even if it's not related to any of your work obligations?

What do you think of those ideas? Are there any other activities or tasks you'd like to include in your homework for the next week?

Patient: Setting aside time to connect with Emma and Jake sounds doable. I can try calling Emma in the evenings, like you said. As for the music, I haven't played in years. I don't even know if I remember how. But I can try listening to some tunes. Maybe it'll help me relax.

Anything else you think I should try? I'm open to suggestions, but I want to keep it simple.

Therapist: Those sound like great ideas, Derek. I think setting aside specific time for connection and relaxation could be really beneficial for you. And listening to music is a wonderful way to reconnect with an activity you used to enjoy.

I also wanted to suggest a small homework task related to challenging your thoughts. Remember how we've talked about the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors? One way to practice this is to write down one or two of your most distressing thoughts each day, and then try to find evidence for and against those thoughts.

This can help you start to examine your thoughts more objectively and see if there might be alternative ways of looking at the situation. It's a simple but powerful way to start building those cognitive restructuring skills we've been discussing.

What do you think about giving that a try alongside the connection and relaxation tasks?

Patient: Writing down my thoughts sounds like a lot of work, but I get what you're saying. It might help me see things differently. I can try it, but I don't want to overdo it. Just one or two thoughts a day, right?

And yeah, I'll keep working on connecting with Emma and Jake, and listening to some music. Those seem more straightforward.

Therapist: That's a great attitude, Derek. The goal of these homework tasks is to help you make small, consistent progress in the areas we've discussed, not to overwhelm you with too much at once.

So, to summarize, for homework this week, I'd suggest:

1. Setting aside a specific time each day to connect with Emma or Jake, and calling Emma in the evening.
2. Listening to music or other relaxation activities for 15 minutes a day, even if it's just listening.
3. Writing down one or two of your most distressing thoughts each day and examining the evidence for and against those thoughts.

Does that sound manageable? Is there anything you'd like to add or change?

Patient: Yeah, that sounds manageable. I can handle those tasks. I'll try to stick to calling Emma in the evenings and listening to some music. As for writing down my thoughts, I'll give it a shot.

Anything else we need to cover today, or can we wrap it up?

Therapist: I think we've covered a lot of important topics today, Derek. We've discussed reaching out to your children, practicing self-care, and challenging your thoughts. I think those are all really important aspects of your therapeutic journey.

Before we wrap up, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling right now. How are you doing after our conversation today?

Patient: I'm feeling okay, I guess. It's a lot to think about, but I know I need to keep working on these things. It's just hard sometimes, you know? But I'll do my best with the homework.

Anything else you need from me before we end?

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling okay, Derek. It's completely understandable that it's a lot to process. Remember that therapy is a process, and it takes time to see changes. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

I want to commend you for your openness and willingness to try new things, even when it's difficult. That's a huge strength, and it's a great foundation for the work we'll continue to do together.

Before we end, let's do a quick check-in on your mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the support. My mood's been up and down lately, but I'm trying to stay positive. I just hope I can keep making progress with everything we've talked about.

That's about it for now. I'll see you next time.

Therapist: I'm confident that you can continue to make progress, Derek. Remember that setbacks are a normal part of the journey, and they don't define your overall progress. You've shown a lot of resilience and determination so far, and I'm excited to see how you continue to grow in therapy.

Take care, and remember to practice self-compassion when you're feeling discouraged or frustrated with yourself. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough.

### Explanation:
Throughout the session, Nova applies CBT techniques to help Derek manage his depressive symptoms and work towards his therapy goals. 

1. Alternative perspective taking: Nova helps Derek consider different viewpoints on his relationship with his children and explores alternative explanations for their responses, such as their own stressors and emotional capacity.

2. Small steps approach: Nova encourages Derek to break down self-care goals into manageable, daily tasks, such as setting aside time to connect with his children or listen to music.

3. Identifying controllable aspects: Nova helps Derek recognize that while he can't control his children's responses, he can control how he responds to them and how he invests his time and energy in self-care and personal growth.

4. Homework assignment: Nova assigns homework tasks related to reaching out to children, practicing self-care, and examining distressing thoughts. These tasks are designed to help Derek practice the skills they discuss in therapy and extend them to his daily life.

5. Mindfulness: In previous sessions, Nova has encouraged Derek to practice mindfulness techniques to help him stay grounded in the present moment and manage overwhelming emotions. This technique can be helpful when Derek feels discouraged or frustrated with himself.

6. Positive data log: In future sessions, Nova may introduce the Positive Data Log technique to help Derek accumulate evidence that challenges his negative core beliefs and supports more adaptive beliefs about himself.

7. CBT triangle: Throughout the session, Nova uses the CBT triangle to help Derek understand the connection between his thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. They explore how these elements interact and influence each other in Derek's specific situations.

8. Cognitive restructuring: Nova helps Derek examine the evidence for and against his negative thoughts and considers alternative perspectives to develop more balanced and realistic thinking patterns.

9. Behavioral experiments: In future sessions, Nova may design behavioral experiments for Derek to test out some of his beliefs and assumptions, particularly around his expectations for his children's responses to his efforts to reconnect with them.

10. Self-compassion: Nova reminds Derek to practice self-compassion when he's feeling discouraged or frustrated with himself. This involves treating himself with kindness and understanding, acknowledging that progress is not always linear, and celebrating small victories along the way.

In summary, this session focuses on helping Derek set realistic goals, build on his progress in managing depressive symptoms, and develop more adaptive coping strategies. Key topics include reaching out to children, practicing self-care, managing overwhelming emotions, and challenging negative thoughts. The session also emphasizes the importance of self-.
