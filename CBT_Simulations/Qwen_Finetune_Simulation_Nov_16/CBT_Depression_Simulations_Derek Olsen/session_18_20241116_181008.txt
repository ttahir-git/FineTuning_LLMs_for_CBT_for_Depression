Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again for our 18th CBT session. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions. Sometimes, I might generate inaccurate information or responses. Also, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. My role is to support you in managing your emotions and improving your overall well-being. Since our last session, how have you been doing?

Patient: Hey, Nova. Yeah, I've been alright, I guess. Not much has changed, really. Still dealing with the same old stuffâ€”pain, money problems, feeling like I'm just spinning my wheels. But I did try to clean up the workshop a bit, like you suggested. It's not perfect, but it's a start.

Therapist: I appreciate your honesty, Derek. It's good to hear that you made some progress with the workshop. Before we dive deeper into that, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review your homework from the last session, discuss the progress you've made, and explore how we can continue building on the skills you've learned. How does that sound to you?

Patient: Alright, that sounds fair. Let's get into it. I did try to reach out to my kids, but it didn't go as smoothly as I hoped. I sent a text to Emma, but she didn't really respond. Jake called back, but we just ended up arguing about money. So, not the best outcome, but at least I tried, right?

Therapist: Reaching out to your children is a significant step, and it's good that you took that initiative. Let's explore what happened during those interactions. What thoughts and emotions were going through your mind during the exchange with Emma and Jake?

Patient: Well, with Emma, I was just hoping she'd respond, you know? I felt a bit anxious, thinking maybe she'd ignore me or something. When she didn't reply, I felt kind of rejected and like I'm just a burden to everyone. With Jake, I was frustrated because we ended up arguing about money again. I felt like a failure, like I can't even handle this one thing right.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Derek. It seems like the interactions brought up some difficult emotions, like rejection and feelings of being a burden or a failure. Let's take a closer look at those thoughts. When you thought that your children were going to ignore you or that you're a burden, what evidence did you have to support those thoughts?

Patient: Well, for one, it's been a while since we talked. And when we did, Emma seemed a little distant, like she was just being polite. Jake's been pretty busy with his own family and work. Seeing them struggle to find time for me, it just felt like I'm in the way, you know? Like my problems are just too much for them to handle.

Therapist: I understand how those interactions might have led you to feel that way. However, it's important to consider alternative explanations. For example, Emma and Jake might be so caught up in their own lives that they don't have time to respond to your messages right away. Or they might be hesitant to share their own struggles with you. Does that sound possible?

Patient: Yeah, I guess that could be true. But it still feels like they're avoiding me, like they don't want to deal with my problems. I mean, I wouldn't blame them if they did. I've been a mess for a while now.

Therapist: That's a good point, Derek. It's possible that they are struggling, and you're right that it's not easy to open up to others about our difficulties. However, it's also possible that they care about you and are hesitant to burden you with their own issues. Have you talked to either of your children about how they've been feeling?

Patient: No, I haven't. I guess I just assumed they were doing okay and didn't want to bother them with my stuff. But maybe I should ask them how they're doing, see if they need anything.

Therapist: That could be a great idea, Derek. It shows that you care about their well-being and want to be there for them. Remember, just because you've been feeling disconnected from them doesn't mean that they're doing the same with you. It's important to communicate and try to understand each other's perspectives. How do you feel about that?

Patient: I feel a bit nervous about it, to be honest. But I guess it's worth a shot. If they're going through something, maybe we can help each other out.

Therapist: It's normal to feel nervous about reaching out to your children, especially given the challenges you've been facing. We can work on some strategies to help you feel more confident and prepared for those conversations. One thing that can be helpful is to practice challenging those negative thoughts we discussed earlier. What do you think about that?

Patient: I think it's worth a try. I just don't want to make things worse for them. But if it helps us understand each other better, then maybe it's the right move.

Therapist: That's a great perspective, Derek. Let's continue to explore how we can use the skills you've learned to help you approach these conversations with a more balanced and compassionate mindset. Before we do that, I want to check in with you. How are you feeling about everything we've discussed so far?

Patient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful, I guess. It's still tough, but maybe talking to Emma and Jake will help. I just need to figure out how to start that conversation without making things awkward.

Therapist: That's a great goal, Derek. Starting a conversation with your children can be challenging, but having the right approach can make a big difference. Let's think about how you can use the communication skills we've discussed to help you feel more prepared. What do you think about using "I" statements to express your feelings and concerns, while also inviting them to share their own?

Patient: Yeah, "I" statements might help. I can say something like, "I've been feeling disconnected from you, and I want to know how you're doing." That way, it's not all about me, and they can feel comfortable sharing their own stuff too.

Therapist: Exactly, Derek. Using "I" statements can help you express your feelings without putting them on the defensive. Another thing to consider is to be specific about what you want to discuss and how you hope it might help. That way, you're more likely to have a productive conversation. For example, you could say, "I've been going through a tough time lately, and I know we haven't had a lot of time together. I'd love to hear how you're feeling and see if we can find some ways to connect more often." What do you think about that approach?

Patient: That sounds like a good way to start. I can tell them I'm struggling and want to reconnect, and then see where it goes from there. It's worth a try, I guess.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're open to giving it a try, Derek. Remember, even if things don't go perfectly, it's still a step in the right direction. The important thing is that you're reaching out and showing your care for your children, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. As you practice these skills, it will become easier and more natural over time. How are you feeling about going forward with this approach?

Patient: I'm feeling a bit more confident, I guess. It's still nerve-wracking, but I know it's something I need to do. I just hope they're willing to talk too.

Therapist: It's good to hear that you're feeling more confident, Derek. Remember, even if they don't respond right away or if it feels awkward at first, it doesn't mean that the effort you're putting in is wasted. You're taking a brave step by reaching out, and that's something to be proud of. Let's continue to explore how you can use these communication skills to have these conversations, even if they don't always go the way you hope. What do you think about that?

Patient: I think it's worth a shot. I just need to be patient and keep trying. If it helps us understand each other better, then it's all worth it.

Therapist: Absolutely, Derek. Patience and persistence are key in these situations. Let's continue to work on developing these skills together, and we can practice some scenarios to help you feel more prepared. Remember, it's not about getting it perfect every time, but about showing up and trying your best. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds good. I just need to keep pushing forward, even when it feels tough. Thanks for the support, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have setbacks or challenges along the way. The important thing is that you keep going and never give up on yourself or your goals. Let's continue to work together to help you build the skills and resilience you need to overcome these obstacles and improve your overall well-being.

Patient: Yeah, I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to put in the effort. I just hope it pays off in the end.

Therapist: I'm confident that your hard work and dedication will pay off, Derek. It may take time, but you're already making progress, and that's something to celebrate. Let's continue to focus on the present and work towards your goals, one step at a time. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss today?

Patient: Not really, just hoping to keep moving forward and make some real progress. I appreciate your help, Nova.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling hopeful and motivated to continue moving forward, Derek. That's a great sign of progress. Before we wrap up today's session, let's take a moment to review what we've discussed and set some goals for the week ahead. We talked about reaching out to your children, using "I" statements, and being patient and persistent in the face of challenges. How are you feeling about implementing these strategies in the coming days?

Patient: I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important. I'll try to reach out to my kids and use those "I" statements you mentioned. I just hope it goes well.

Therapist: It's normal to feel nervous when trying something new, Derek. Remember, even if it doesn't go perfectly, you're still taking brave steps towards improving your relationships and communication with your children. Let's work together to make a plan for how you can reach out to them in the coming days. What would you like to say, and when do you think would be the best time to have these conversations?

Patient: I think I'll start by sending a text to my daughter, Emma. I'll say something like, "Hey Emma, I've been thinking about you and want to catch up. Are you free for a call sometime this week?" As for timing, maybe later today or tomorrow morning would work.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Derek. Setting a specific time and place to reach out can help you feel more prepared and in control of the situation. Remember, it's okay if the conversation doesn't go perfectly the first time. You can keep trying and refining your approach until you feel more comfortable. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the plan?

Patient: No, I think that's it for now. I'll give it a shot and see how it goes. Thanks for the support, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's continue to work together to help you reach out to your children and build your communication skills. In the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out if you need any help or encouragement along the way. I'm happy to check in with you and see how things are going.
