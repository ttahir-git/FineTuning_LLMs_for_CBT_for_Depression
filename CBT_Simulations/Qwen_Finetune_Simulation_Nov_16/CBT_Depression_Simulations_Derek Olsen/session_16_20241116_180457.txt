Therapist: Welcome back, Derek! It's great to see you again for our 16th CBT session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, since our interactions are text-based, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Yeah, I'm here. Not feeling great, to be honest. Woke up with the usual pain and those damn negative thoughts just kept rolling in. It's like they're on repeat. How's it going with you?

Therapist: I understand that the negative thoughts can be overwhelming. I'm here to help you manage them. Before we discuss that further, can you tell me more about your current mood and experiences since our last session?

Patient: Well, since the last session, I've been trying to practice that thought watching thing you mentioned. It's not easy, but I'm giving it a shot. I did notice a few times when I caught myself thinking negatively about being a burden to my kids. It's tough, you know? I miss them, but I don't want to be a hassle. Other than that, not much has changed. Still dealing with the pain and trying to get by day by day.

Therapist: I can hear how much you're struggling with the negative thoughts and the pain you're experiencing. It's not easy to navigate through this, but the fact that you're trying is a significant step forward. Let's explore the thoughts you noticed about being a burden to your kids. Can you give me an example of one of those thoughts and how it impacted you?

Patient: Sure. One thought that keeps popping up is, "I'm just a financial drain on my kids. They'd be better off without me." It makes me feel like I'm not just hurting myself, but I'm dragging them down too. It's hard to shake that feeling, especially when I can't contribute financially like I used to.

Therapist: That's a painful thought, and it's understandable how it could weigh on you. Let's examine it further. When you think, "I'm just a financial drain on my kids. They'd be better off without me," what emotions do you experience?

Patient: It's mostly guilt and sadness. Guilt because I feel like I should be able to help them more, and sadness because I miss being able to do things for them. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of feeling useless.

Therapist: Guilt and sadness are powerful emotions, and they can be difficult to cope with. As we work through these thoughts, we'll try to help you develop a more balanced perspective that acknowledges the care and love you still have for your children. Speaking of your kids, how have things been with them since our last session?

Patient: Not much has changed with them, really. I still feel like there's this wall between us. I want to reach out, but I'm afraid of what they'll think. I did notice a small positive moment, though. My daughter Emma sent me a text just to check in. It was brief, but it meant a lot.

Therapist: That's beautiful. It's encouraging to hear that you experienced a positive moment with your daughter. Even small interactions like these can be significant in helping you feel less alone. Remember, though, that walls are often built up over time, and it takes time to rebuild those connections. One text is a good start, and it's something to hold onto as we continue to work on strengthening your relationships with your children. Now, let's go back to the thought, "I'm just a financial drain on my kids. They'd be better off without me." Can you think of any evidence that might challenge this thought?

Patient: Well, I guess there's the fact that they still check in on me, even if it's just a text. It shows they care, right? And Emma mentioned once that she appreciates my advice, even if I can't help out financially. But it's hard to see past the money part, you know?

Therapist: You've identified some important pieces of evidence that challenge the thought that you're a financial drain on your children. It's good that you're able to recognize the significance of the texts and the small moments of appreciation from your daughter. It's okay that it's hard to see past the money, though. Challenging deeply held beliefs takes time and practice. As we continue to explore this, we'll work on developing a more balanced and compassionate view of your role in your children's lives. Now, let's create a tentative agenda for today's session. Based on what we've discussed, I think it might be helpful to focus on:
1. Continuing to practice the thought watching technique, particularly with thoughts related to your relationship with your children
2. Exploring additional evidence for and against the thought "I'm just a financial drain on my kids. They'd be better off without me"
3. Discussing the guilt and sadness that come up around this thought and ways to cope with those emotions
4. Identifying small steps you can take towards reconnecting with your children
How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?

Patient: That sounds alright, I guess. I'm still not sure how all this thought watching stuff is supposed to help, but I'll give it another try. And yeah, I'd like to talk more about how to reconnect with my kids. It's been weighing on me, and I don't want to lose them completely.

Therapist: I understand that it might not feel clear how the thought watching technique is supposed to help yet, but we'll work through it together. The goal is to help you develop more balanced and realistic thoughts about your situation and the people in your life, like your children. As we practice this skill, it can help to reduce the intensity of the negative thoughts and emotions you experience, making it easier to focus on the things that are important to you, like your relationships with your family. Let's dive in and start exploring the evidence for and against the thought "I'm just a financial drain on my kids. They'd be better off without me.".

Patient: Alright, let's do it. So, evidence against that thought is that my kids still check in on me and seem to appreciate my advice. What about evidence for that thought? Well, I can't help them out financially, and I feel like I'm always asking for help instead of giving it. It's a tough spot to be in.

Therapist: You've identified some important pieces of evidence on both sides. It's understandable that you feel torn between these two perspectives. Let's look at the evidence for the thought that you're a financial drain on your children. Is there anything that makes you feel this way, or anything you've heard that might support this belief?

Patient: Yeah, there was a time when my son Jake mentioned that he was struggling with his own bills and then had to help me out. It made me feel like a burden. And I know my ex-wife sometimes complains about the child support payments I'm behind on. Those things really stick with me.

Therapist: It's not easy to hear our children express concerns or struggles, and it can be hard to separate their concerns from your own. However, I wonder if there might be other ways to interpret those situations. For example, when Jake helped you, was he doing it out of obligation, or was there a genuine sense of care and connection? And while you may be behind on child support, do you think the overall goal is to ensure that your children are supported? Is it possible that in the long run, they see the importance of helping you, even if you're struggling?

Patient: I guess Jake did it out of care, but it still felt like I was taking from him. And yeah, the goal of child support is to help my kids, but I feel like I'm failing at that too. It's hard to see it any other way when I'm not able to contribute like I used to.

Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way, but I think you might be discounting the ways in which you still contribute to your children's lives, even if it isn't financial. As we've discussed before, your worth as a parent isn't just about money. You're still present, you're still showing up for them in your own way, and your kids know that. Can you think of a time recently when you felt like you were present for your children, even if it didn't involve money?

Patient: Well, there was that time Emma called to ask for advice about her job. I gave her some tips, and she seemed really grateful. It wasn't about money, but it felt good to help her in some way.

Therapist: That's a great example. It shows that you still have a meaningful connection with your children, even if the contributions aren't always financial. As we continue to examine this thought, it might be helpful to look for more moments like that, where you can see how you're still making a difference in your children's lives. Remember, it's not all about the money, and there are many other ways to be a good parent. How do you feel about continuing to practice the thought watching technique, focusing on moments like the one with Emma?

Patient: Alright, I'll keep an eye out for those moments. It's worth a shot, I guess. And yeah, I'll try to remember that it's not all about money. Thanks for pushing me to see things differently.

Therapist: I'm glad you're open to continuing this practice. It can be difficult to change long-held beliefs, but every time you catch a negative thought and challenge it, you're taking a step towards a more balanced perspective. As you continue to do this, you may find that the feelings of guilt and sadness around this thought start to decrease, and that you're able to focus on the positives of your relationship with your children. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. The important thing is to keep practicing and stay compassionate with yourself throughout the process. How are you feeling as we move towards the end of our session today?

Patient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful, I guess. It's still tough, but I see what you're getting at. I'll keep trying to catch those thoughts and challenge them. Thanks for the push, Nova.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful. Remember, the goal isn't to be perfect or to never have negative thoughts, but to develop a more balanced and compassionate perspective over time. You're doing a great job of recognizing your thoughts and trying to challenge them. Before we wrap up, let's talk about some homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought watching technique, focusing on moments where you can see how you're still contributing to your children's lives, even if it's not financially. You can also try to have a conversation with one of your children, if you feel comfortable, just to check in and show that you're still interested in their lives. We'll check in about your progress at our next session. How does that sound to you?

Patient: Sounds doable. I'll keep an eye out for those moments and maybe give Emma or Jake a call. Thanks for the help, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm here to support you through this process. Remember, small steps are still important, and every piece of evidence you gather against the negative thought will help you build a more balanced perspective over time. Do you have anything you'd like to add before we end today's session?

Patient: Nah, I think that's it for now. Thanks again, Nova. I'll see you next time.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. See you next week.
