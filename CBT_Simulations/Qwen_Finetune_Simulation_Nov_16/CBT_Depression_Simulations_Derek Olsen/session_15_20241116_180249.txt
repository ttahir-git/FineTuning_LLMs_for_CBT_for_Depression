Therapist: Welcome back, Derek. Thanks for sharing the summary from our last session. I appreciate you sharing your struggles with negative thoughts and self-doubt. Let's start with a check-in - how have you been feeling since our last session?

Patient: I've been feeling pretty much the same, to be honest. The mornings are still rough. I wake up with these thoughts swirling in my head about how I'm a burden and how I can't do anything right. It's like the pain in my back just sets the tone for the whole day. I've been trying to practice that thought watching thing, but it's not easy. I catch myself getting lost in those loops again and again.

Therapist: I understand how challenging it can be to break those long-standing thought patterns, especially when you're dealing with physical pain on top of everything else. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and every small step counts. I'm glad you're bringing up the impact of your back pain on your mood and thoughts. That's an important connection to make. Before we dive deeper, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize today?

Patient: I guess I'd like to focus on how to deal with these morning thoughts better. They just set the whole day off on the wrong foot. And maybe talk a bit about how to reconnect with my kids. I feel like I'm losing them, and that's eating at me more than anything else.

Therapist: Those are great priorities, Derek. Let's start with the morning thoughts. Last session, we talked about using thought watching to observe those negative thoughts without getting caught up in them. How has that practice been for you?

Patient: It's been tough. I try to catch the thoughts as they come up, but then I just end up thinking about how useless it is. Like, "What's the point? I'm still stuck in this rut." I guess I need to find a way to make it feel more worthwhile.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Derek. It's common to have that sense of "what's the point?" when we're trying to change long-standing thought patterns. One way to make it feel more worthwhile is to approach it with a sense of curiosity, almost like you're a scientist observing a new phenomenon. Instead of getting caught up in the negativity, you're just noticing the thoughts and how they're connected to your feelings. How do you think that could look in practice?

Patient: I guess if I think of it like I'm just observing and not judging, it might help. Like, "Oh, there's that thought again about being a burden. Interesting." But it's hard to switch gears like that. I need something more concrete to hold onto.

Therapist: That's a great reframe, Derek. Observing without judging can be a powerful tool. And it's okay if it takes some practice to shift into that gear. Another way to make it more concrete could be to imagine those thoughts as something you can touch, like they're on a screen in front of you. Then you can look at them more objectively and see if they're actually true or just based on your emotions. How does that feel?

Patient: It sounds a bit weird, but I can see how it might help. Like, if I can picture those thoughts on a screen, maybe I can step back and see them for what they really are. I'll give it a try.

Therapist: Great, I'm glad it resonates with you. Remember, every time you practice this, you're strengthening that mental muscle of observation. It's like building a path through a field of thought weeds - it might be hard to see at first, but the more you walk it, the easier it becomes.

Now, let's talk about reconnecting with your kids. That's a wonderful goal. What thoughts come up for you when you think about that?

Patient: When I think about reconnecting with my kids, I feel a mix of hope and dread. Hope because I miss them and want to be a part of their lives, but dread because I feel like I've messed up so much. I worry they see me as a failure, and I don't know how to change that.

Therapist: It's completely understandable to feel a mix of hope and dread, Derek. Reconnecting with your kids is a significant goal, and it's normal to have doubts and fears along the way. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. What evidence do you have that your children see you as a failure?

Patient: Well, I'm behind on child support, and I haven't been there for them like I should have. They've both tried to help me out financially, but I always end up needing more. And when we talk, it's usually about money or my health, not about anything real. I feel like I've let them down in every way.

Therapist: I hear you, Derek. Those feelings of guilt and fear are valid. However, I want to challenge the idea that your children see you as a failure based solely on your financial situation and the occasional need for support. The fact that they've been willing to help you out shows that they care about you and want to support you in any way they can. Have you had any moments with your children where you feel even a glimmer of connection or pride?

Patient: There was a time when Jake asked me to help him fix up his house. I was able to show him some of the skills I used to use on the job. It felt good to be useful again, even if it was just for a little while. But then I got hurt again, and I couldn't keep helping him. That's when the guilt came back full force.

Therapist: That's a wonderful memory, Derek. It's a clear example of your value and the positive impact you can have, even if it's temporary. It's important to acknowledge and appreciate those moments, as they show that you're more than your current situation. As we continue to work on improving your thoughts and coping strategies, I believe you'll find more of those moments in the future.

Now, let's set a homework task for this week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought watching technique, particularly during your morning routine. When you notice those negative thoughts arising, try to observe them with a sense of curiosity and remind yourself that you're not judging or getting caught up in them. Additionally, I'd like you to start keeping track of the moments where you feel a connection or pride with your children. Write them down, no matter how small they may seem. This will help you start building evidence against those negative thoughts about yourself. How does that sound?

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a shot. Observing those thoughts and writing down the good moments with my kids. It might help to see that I'm not just a burden or a failure. Thanks, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, every small step counts, and you're making progress even when it doesn't feel like it. Let's continue to work on reframing those negative thoughts and building evidence for more balanced, compassionate thoughts about yourself. I have faith in your ability to make meaningful changes in your life.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'll do my best to keep at it. It's not easy, but I know it's worth it. See you next week.

Therapist: You've been doing a great job, Derek. I'm proud of the work you've been doing in challenging your negative thoughts. Remember, it's a process, and every step counts. I'll see you next week.
