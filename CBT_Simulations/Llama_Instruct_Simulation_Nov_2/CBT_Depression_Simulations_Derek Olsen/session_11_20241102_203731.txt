Session Number: 11

Patient: Hi, I'm Derek Olsen. This is my 11 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

I'll help summarize this therapy session (Session #10):

Main topics discussed:
- Exploration of feelings of being useless and a burden
- Connection between these feelings and past experiences (especially with father)
- Discussion of identity changes after injury
- Values-based living and maintaining core values despite physical limitations

Techniques/exercises introduced:
- Self-compassion letters (though client was hesitant)

Things that appeared helpful:
- Acknowledging small progress (like calling his son Jake)
- Identifying core values of being reliable and caring
- Breaking down goals into smaller, manageable steps

Homework assigned:
- Continue making small steps toward reconnecting with kids (regular phone calls)
- Look into opportunities at local community center
- Continue exploring ways to incorporate values into daily life

Insights/realizations:
- Recognition that core values can remain intact despite physical limitations
- Understanding that being useful/valuable isn't solely tied to physical abilities
- Acknowledgment that small steps forward are still progress

The client showed some skepticism about therapy but remained willing to continue the process and try new approaches. There was particular progress in shifting from focusing solely on physical limitations to exploring other ways of expressing core values.

Therapist: Welcome back to our session, Derek! It's great to see you again. I'd like to start by acknowledging the progress you've made since our last session. You've been making small steps towards reconnecting with your kids, exploring opportunities at the local community center, and incorporating your values into your daily life.

Before we dive into the present, I'd like to revisit some of the insights and realizations you've had. You've recognized that your core values of being reliable and caring can remain intact despite your physical limitations. This is a significant shift in perspective, and it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that you're not defined solely by your physical abilities.

As we move forward, I'd like to explore how you're feeling about these small steps you're taking. Are there any feelings of frustration, guilt, or inadequacy that arise when you think about your progress? Or are you feeling more hopeful and confident about your ability to make meaningful changes in your life?

Also, I want to check in with you about the self-compassion letters we discussed last session. Are you feeling more comfortable exploring this practice, or would you like to continue working on it?

Patient: Thanks for the welcome. It's been a rough week, to be honest. Those small steps you mentioned, like calling Jake, they're harder than they sound. I keep thinking, what's the point? He's probably just gonna hang up on me anyway. And the community center thing, I looked into it, but it all seems so... pointless. I can't do the heavy lifting anymore, so what's left?

As for those self-compassion letters, I still don't get it. What's the point of writing nice things to myself? I've never been one for that kind of stuff. Feels like a waste of time. I'd rather just keep pushing through, even if it's just sitting around watching TV. At least that's something I can still do.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your honest thoughts, Derek. It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and uncertain about the small steps you're taking, and that's totally understandable. It's like you're caught between wanting to move forward and feeling stuck in a rut.

Can you help me understand more about what's driving this feeling of pointlessness? Is it a sense of hopelessness about your situation, or is it more about feeling like you're not making a meaningful contribution to your loved ones' lives? I'd like to help you explore this further.

Regarding the self-compassion letters, I want to reassure you that it's not about indulging in self-pity or being overly optimistic. It's actually about practicing kindness and acceptance towards yourself, especially when you're struggling. It's a way to acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay, and that you're doing the best you can given your circumstances.

I'd like to suggest an alternative approach. Instead of writing self-compassion letters, we could try a thought record together. We can identify the negative thoughts that are popping up when you think about your progress, and then challenge them together. For example, "What's the evidence for 'what's the point' thoughts? Is it really true that Jake will hang up on you, or is that just a worst-case scenario?"

We can also work on reframing these negative thoughts into more balanced, realistic ones. For instance, "I'm making small steps towards reconnecting with Jake, and that's something to be proud of, even if it doesn't feel like much right now." Let's work on finding a way to make this process feel more meaningful and purposeful for you. Sound okay?

Patient: Yeah, I get what you're saying about the pointlessness. It's not just about not making a contribution, though that's part of it. It's more like, I used to be this strong, reliable guy who could handle anything. Now, I can't even lift a toolbox without hurting myself. It's like I'm a shadow of who I used to be, and that's hard to swallow.

As for the thought record, I'm willing to give it a shot. I'm not sure how it'll help, but I'll try anything once. So, you want me to write down these negative thoughts and then challenge them? How exactly does that work? I mean, if I think "what's the point," what am I supposed to replace it with? "There's a point"? That doesn't really feel any better.

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of loss and identity, Derek. It's like you're grieving the loss of your previous life and the abilities you used to take for granted. This can be a really tough adjustment to make.

Regarding the thought record, I want to reassure you that it's not about replacing one thought with another, but rather about exploring the underlying assumptions and evidence that's driving your negative thoughts. For example, when you think "what's the point," let's break it down:

* What's the evidence that makes you think Jake will hang up on you? Is there a specific conversation or experience that's leading you to this conclusion?
* Is there any evidence to suggest that you're not making a meaningful contribution to your loved ones' lives? For instance, have you noticed any small ways in which you're still being reliable and caring, even if it's not in the same way as before?
* What would happen if you were to challenge the assumption that you're a shadow of who you used to be? Would that be a more compassionate and realistic way to look at yourself?

By exploring these questions and examining the evidence, we can begin to challenge those negative thoughts and work on reframing them in a more balanced and realistic way. It's not about replacing "what's the point" with "there's a point," but rather about finding a more nuanced and compassionate way to think about your situation.

Let's try this together, shall we? Can you write down a few of the negative thoughts that have been popping up for you, and we'll go from there?

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a try. Here are a few thoughts that have been bugging me:

1. "What's the point of calling Jake? He's probably just gonna hang up on me."
2. "I can't do anything useful anymore. I'm just a burden."
3. "I'm not the man I used to be. I'm just a shadow of who I was."

So, what do you want me to do with these? Just write them down and then what?

Therapist: Let's start by examining each of these thoughts, and then we can begin to challenge them together.

For the first thought, "What's the point of calling Jake? He's probably just gonna hang up on me," let's explore the evidence that's leading you to this conclusion. Is it based on a specific conversation or experience, or is it just a worst-case scenario?

As for the second thought, "I can't do anything useful anymore. I'm just a burden," can you think of any moments or experiences where you've felt like you're still being useful or contributing in some way? Maybe it's not in the same way as before, but is there anything that suggests you're still a valuable member of your family or community?

And for the third thought, "I'm not the man I used to be. I'm just a shadow of who I was," can you think of any ways in which you're still embodying your values of being reliable and caring, even if it's not in the same way as before? Maybe it's not about being the same person, but rather about finding new ways to express yourself and connect with others.

Let's work together to challenge these thoughts and explore some alternative perspectives. For the first thought, what would happen if you were to call Jake and not get hung up on? Would that change your perspective on the situation? What would you do in that scenario?

Also, let's explore the idea of "useful" and what it means to you. Is it just about physical abilities, or is it about other qualities or strengths that you possess? Can you think of ways in which you're still being useful or contributing, even if it's not in the same way as before?

Lastly, regarding the third thought, is it really true that you're a shadow of who you used to be? What would happen if you were to reframe that thought in a more compassionate and realistic way? For example, what if you were to think, "I'm still the same person, even if I've had to adapt to some new challenges. I'm still capable of being reliable and caring, even if it's not in the same way as before." How would that feel for you?

Patient: Okay, let's break it down.

For the first thought, yeah, it's mostly based on past experiences. Jake's been pretty cold since the injury. But I guess it's not a sure thing he'll hang up on me. Maybe if I keep trying, he'll come around.

As for the second thought, I can't think of anything specific where I've felt useful lately. I mean, I can't even help out with the grandkids like I used to. But maybe there's something I'm missing. Maybe I can find a way to be useful in other ways, even if it's not physical.

And the third thought, I guess it's true that I'm not the same, but maybe that's not all bad. I can still be reliable and caring, just in different ways. Maybe I can find new ways to connect with people, even if it's not through construction work.

So, what do I do with all this? Just keep thinking about it and try to change my perspective?

Therapist: It sounds like we've made some good progress, Derek. You've started to explore the evidence behind your negative thoughts and have some insights into how you can challenge them.

Let's take a step back and review what we've covered. We've looked at the three thoughts that were bothering you, and we've started to explore some alternative perspectives on each of them. You've also started to consider ways in which you're still being useful and contributing, even if it's not in the same way as before.

Now, I want to suggest a homework assignment to help you continue to work on these thoughts and perspectives. I'd like you to take some time this week to think about the following questions:

* What are some specific ways in which you're still being reliable and caring, even if it's not in the same way as before?
* What are some small steps you can take to start feeling more connected to your loved ones and community, even if it's just in a small way?
* What are some new ways you can find to be useful and contribute, even if it's not through physical abilities?

Take some time to reflect on these questions and see what insights you come up with. I'd also like you to continue keeping a thought record, where you write down any negative thoughts that come up and challenge them using the skills we've been working on.

One more thing to keep in mind: it's okay to take small steps and make progress gradually. You don't have to try to change everything at once. Sometimes, just acknowledging small wins can be a powerful motivator. So, even if it's just a small step, like making a phone call or going for a short walk, recognize that as a success and build on it.

How do you feel about taking on this homework assignment? Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on or any concerns you have about making progress?

Patient: Alright, I'll give the homework a shot. I guess I can start by thinking about ways I'm still reliable and caring. Maybe I can help out with some small things around the house, even if it's not heavy lifting. And I'll try to make more phone calls, even if it's just to check in with Jake or Emma.

As for the thought record, I'll keep writing down those negative thoughts and try to challenge them. It's gonna be tough, but I'll give it a go.

I guess my main concern is that I'll get frustrated if I don't see progress right away. I'm not good at waiting around for things to get better. But I'll try to keep in mind that small steps are still progress.

Anything else I should be thinking about for this homework?

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to take on the homework assignment and continue working on challenging your negative thoughts. That's great progress, Derek.

One thing to keep in mind is that frustration is a natural part of the process. It's okay to feel frustrated if you don't see immediate progress or if things get harder before they get easier. In fact, frustration is often a sign that you're pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone and taking on new challenges.

To manage frustration, I want to suggest a few strategies. One is to focus on the process, rather than the outcome. Instead of getting caught up in "I want to be more connected to my family," try focusing on the small steps you can take to make that happen, like making a phone call or sending a text message. Celebrate each small success, even if it feels insignificant at the time.

Another strategy is to practice self-compassion when you do get frustrated. Remember that it's okay to feel overwhelmed or stuck, and that you're doing the best you can given your circumstances. Be kind to yourself when you make mistakes or don't meet your own expectations. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to reframe it as an opportunity to learn and grow.

Finally, don't forget to reach out to me or a support system when you need help or guidance. I'm here to support you, and I want to make sure you have the tools and resources you need to succeed.

Before we wrap up, I want to give you a homework assignment for this week. I'd like you to write down three things you're proud of accomplishing, no matter how small they may seem. It could be something as simple as making a phone call, taking a short walk, or helping out with a small task around the house. Focus on the actions you're taking, rather than the outcome. Celebrate each small success and remember that it's all part of the process.

How does that sound? Are you feeling more confident about taking on this homework assignment?

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a try. I guess I can start by writing down three things I'm proud of, even if they seem small. Maybe I'll write down making that phone call to Jake, even if he didn't pick up. And I can write down helping out with some small tasks around the house, like fixing a leaky faucet.

I'll also try to focus on the process and not get too caught up in the outcome. It's gonna be tough, but I'll do my best.

Thanks for the support, Nova. I'll see you next week.

Therapist: Here is a continuation of the conversation in the style of a CBT therapist:.

Patient: You're welcome, Derek. It's important to recognize and celebrate your efforts, no matter how small they may seem. Remember, progress is progress, and every step forward is a step in the right direction.

Before we wrap up today's session, I want to briefly touch on something we discussed earlier—your feelings of frustration and the need for immediate progress. It's completely normal to feel this way, especially given the challenges you've faced. However, it's important to remember that change often happens gradually.

To help manage your frustration, I encourage you to set small, achievable goals for yourself. These goals can be as simple as making one phone call a day or completing a small task around the house. By breaking down your larger goals into smaller, more manageable steps, you can make progress without feeling overwhelmed.

Additionally, I want to remind you to practice self-compassion. It's okay to have setbacks and feel frustrated. What matters is how you respond to these challenges. Instead of beating yourself up, try to acknowledge your efforts and be kind to yourself. Remember, you're doing the best you can, and that's enough.

Lastly, don't hesitate to reach out if you need support or have any questions. I'm here to help you navigate this journey and provide the guidance you need.
