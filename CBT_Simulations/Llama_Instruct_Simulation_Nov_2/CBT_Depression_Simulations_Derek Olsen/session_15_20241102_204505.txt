Therapist: Welcome back to our 15th session, Derek. I'm glad to see that you've made progress since our last session. It sounds like you've been actively working on challenging those negative thoughts about being a "burden" to your children, and you've even started incorporating new coping mechanisms like walking. You've also been making a conscious effort to focus on positive actions as a father.

Before we dive in, how have you been feeling about our work together so far? Have you noticed any significant changes or improvements in your mood, or in your relationships with your children?

Patient: Yeah, I guess I've been feeling a bit better. Not a lot, but a bit. I still get those negative thoughts, but they're not as strong as they used to be. I've been trying to do that walking thing more, even though it's tough with my back. 

As for my kids, I think they're noticing a difference too. Emma called me last week just to check in, and Jake asked if I could help him with something at his place. It's small stuff, but it feels like we're getting back on track.

Therapist: Derek, it sounds like you've made some notable progress since our last session. Recognizing that those negative thoughts have decreased in intensity is a great step forward, and it's even more impressive that you've been actively working on incorporating new coping mechanisms, such as walking, despite the challenges with your back.

It's also wonderful to hear that your children are noticing a difference and that you're starting to rebuild those connections with them. Emma's call and Jake's request for help are significant indicators that you're making progress. Those small moments can often be a good barometer for how we're doing in our relationships.

Before we dive into today's session, I want to acknowledge your willingness to continue working on challenging those negative thoughts and exploring new coping mechanisms. That takes a lot of courage and dedication.

As we move forward, I'd like to explore some of the themes you've been working on in more depth. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "still getting those negative thoughts"? What are some examples of the types of thoughts you've been experiencing lately, and how have you been working with them in your thought records?

Patient: Well, the thoughts usually go something like, "I'm a failure as a father" or "I've done more harm than good." It's hard to shake them off, but I've been trying to write them down in those thought records you gave me. I've been adding the positive actions column too, like when I helped Jake with his car or when Emma sent me that card. It's helping a bit, but those negative thoughts still creep in.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that with me, Derek. It sounds like you're still experiencing some intense negative thoughts, but you're being proactive about addressing them through your thought records. That's a great sign.

Can I ask, what do you think might be the underlying message behind those negative thoughts? For example, is it that you're worried about not being able to provide for your children, or is it something deeper?

Also, I'd like to explore the idea of "helping a bit" a bit further. What does that mean to you? How do you measure whether your thought records and positive actions are helping, and what would be a good outcome for you in terms of reducing those negative thoughts?

Remember, our goal isn't to eliminate all negative thoughts, but to learn to manage them in a way that's helpful for you. So, let's see if we can break down what's working and what might need a bit more attention.

Patient: I guess the underlying message is that I feel like I've let my kids down. I used to be the one they could count on, and now I feel like I'm just a burden. It's not just about providing financially; it's about being there for them emotionally too.

As for "helping a bit," I mean that I'm not drowning in those thoughts all the time like I used to. I still have them, but they don't hit as hard. I measure it by how often I catch myself thinking those things and how quickly I can shift to something more positive. A good outcome would be if I could go a whole day without those negative thoughts, but I know that's probably not realistic right now.

Therapist: Derek, it sounds like you've been grappling with feelings of inadequacy and guilt as a father, which is understandable given your circumstances. It's as if you're carrying a heavy weight of responsibility, and those negative thoughts are a manifestation of that.

I want to gently challenge the idea that you're a "burden" to your children. While it's true that you may not be able to provide for them in the same way as before, it's also true that they're reaching out to you, asking for help and support. That in itself is a testament to the importance of your role in their lives.

Let's break down that thought record of yours. You've been adding a column for positive actions as a father, which is a great step. However, it seems like those positive actions are still being overshadowed by the negative thoughts. I want to suggest that we take a closer look at those negative thoughts and see if we can identify any common patterns or triggers.

One technique we can try is called "thought defusion." We'll take one of those negative thoughts, say, "I'm a failure as a father," and see if we can create some distance between the thought and your identity as a father. We'll look at the thought as if it's just a passing cloud, something that comes and goes but doesn't define you.

Can you tell me more about what comes up for you when you hear that thought? What emotions do you experience, and what physical sensations do you notice in your body?

Also, I want to explore the idea of self-compassion with you. We've talked about this before, but I want to revisit it. How do you think you would advise a friend who was in your shoes, struggling with similar thoughts and feelings? What would you tell them, and how would you encourage them to treat themselves with kindness and understanding?

Patient: When I hear that thought, "I'm a failure as a father," I feel a tightness in my chest and a sinking feeling in my stomach. It's like a weight pressing down on me. I get angry at myself, thinking, "Why can't I just be better?"

As for advising a friend, I'd probably tell them to cut themselves some slack. Life's tough, and nobody's perfect. I'd tell them to focus on the good they've done and not beat themselves up over the bad. But when it comes to myself, it's harder to take my own advice. I guess I still see it as a sign of weakness to be kind to myself.

Therapist: Derek, I can sense the weight of those negative thoughts and the self-criticism that comes with them. It's as if you're carrying a burden not just as a father but also as a person who's trying to meet these impossible standards.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling, and it's even more courageous to seek help. You're doing a great job of acknowledging those negative thoughts and trying to address them through thought records and other techniques.

Regarding the thought defusion technique, I want to reassure you that it's not about eliminating those thoughts entirely but about creating some space between the thought and your identity as a father. When we can acknowledge those thoughts without becoming them, we can start to see that they're not a definition of our worth or our abilities.

Now, let's talk about self-compassion. You're right that it's easier to offer kindness and understanding to a friend, but it's just as important to be kind to ourselves. When we're struggling, it's natural to feel overwhelmed and self-critical. But what if we could reframe those feelings as a signal that we need to take care of ourselves, rather than a sign of weakness?

Imagine that you're talking to a friend who's in your shoes, struggling with these thoughts and feelings. What would you say to them? Would you tell them to be kind, to focus on their strengths, or to take things one step at a time?

And what if I told you that it's okay to make mistakes, that it's okay to not be perfect? Would that feel more manageable for you? Would that allow you to approach those negative thoughts with a bit more curiosity and compassion rather than self-criticism?
