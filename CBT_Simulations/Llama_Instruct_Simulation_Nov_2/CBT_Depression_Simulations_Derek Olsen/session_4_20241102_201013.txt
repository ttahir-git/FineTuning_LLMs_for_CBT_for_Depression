Therapist: Hello again, Derek! It's great to see you again. I'm glad you're willing to continue working on our goals together. Before we dive into today's session, I want to acknowledge how brave you've been in showing up and facing your challenges head-on. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we need help and to try new approaches.

Now, let's review where we left off and see how things have progressed. How have you been doing with the "Three Good Things" exercise? Have you been able to identify and journal about three positive moments each day? And how's the woodworking tools project going? Have you made any progress on cleaning and assessing the tools?

Patient: Yeah, I've been doing the "Three Good Things" exercise. It's not easy, but I'm trying. Some days are better than others. I managed to clean up the woodworking tools, but I haven't done much else with them. It's hard to get motivated when everything feels so heavy.

Therapist: Derek, it sounds like you're being kind to yourself and acknowledging the challenges you're facing. That's a great start. I want to acknowledge that it's normal for some days to be better than others, especially when working on new habits like the "Three Good Things" exercise.

It's also great that you were able to make some progress on cleaning the woodworking tools. That's a concrete step forward, and it's something to build on. Instead of focusing on how everything feels "heavy," let's try to break down the task into smaller, more manageable pieces. What's the next small step you could take with the woodworking tools? Is there one specific task that you could focus on completing today or this week?

Also, I'd like to explore the theme of feeling heavy. When you say that everything feels "heavy," can you tell me more about what that feels like? Is it related to your physical body, or is it more of an emotional or mental weight? What do you think might be contributing to this feeling of heaviness?

Patient: The heaviness is mostly emotional and mental. It feels like there's a constant weight on my chest, making it hard to breathe sometimes. I think it's a mix of everything—the pain, the financial stress, feeling like I'm a burden to my kids. It's hard to see a way out when everything feels so stuck.

As for the woodworking tools, the next step might be to start fixing one of the simpler tools, like a hammer or a screwdriver. Just something small to get started.

Therapist: Derek, it sounds like you're experiencing a heavy emotional load, and that's understandable given the challenges you're facing. It's as if you're carrying a weight that's making it hard to move forward.

Let's explore this further. When you say that everything feels stuck, can you tell me more about what that feels like? Is it like you're trying to move forward, but something is holding you back? Is it a specific fear or anxiety that's preventing you from taking action?

Also, I want to gently challenge the idea that you're a burden to your kids. We've discussed this before, but it's worth revisiting. Just because you're experiencing physical limitations doesn't mean you're a burden. In fact, being open about your challenges and asking for help can actually be a sign of strength, not weakness. Would you be willing to explore this idea further?

As for the woodworking tools, it sounds like a great plan to start with a smaller, simpler task. Can you tell me more about why you think fixing a hammer or a screwdriver might be a good place to start? Is it because it seems like a more manageable task, or is there something specific about these tools that resonates with you?

Patient: Yeah, it feels like I'm trying to move forward, but something's always pulling me back. It's like I'm stuck in quicksand, and every time I try to take a step, I just sink deeper. The fear? It's that I'll fail again, that I won't be able to do anything right anymore.

As for being a burden, I know it's not just about physical limitations. It's the whole package—not being able to work, not being able to help out like I used to, always needing something from them. It feels like I'm just taking and not giving back.

Fixing a hammer or a screwdriver seems like a good place to start because it's simple. I know how to do it, and it doesn't require a lot of energy or skill. It's something I can actually finish, and maybe it'll give me a little bit of that feeling of accomplishment again.

Therapist: Derek, thank you for being so honest and vulnerable about your struggles. It takes a lot of courage to admit to feeling stuck and overwhelmed.

I'd like to acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel this way, especially when facing significant challenges like yours. It's like you said, you're trying to move forward, but something is holding you back. I'm here to help you explore what's holding you back and find ways to break through those obstacles.

Regarding the idea of being a burden to your kids, I want to reiterate that this is a common concern many people struggle with, especially when they're experiencing physical limitations. However, it's essential to recognize that your worth and value as a person are not defined solely by your physical abilities. You are still a loving father, a caring partner, and an individual with much to offer, even if you're not able to do things the way you used to.

Let's explore this idea further. Can you think of any moments or experiences where you felt valued and appreciated by your kids, despite your physical limitations? Maybe there's a specific situation or conversation where they expressed gratitude or admiration for something you did, even if it was small?

As for fixing the hammer or screwdriver, I love that you're thinking about starting small and tackling something manageable. That's a great way to build momentum and confidence. What if we were to make a plan together to break down the task into even smaller, more manageable steps? We could brainstorm together to identify specific tasks, such as finding the right tools, watching tutorials, or seeking guidance from a professional.

Remember, Derek, the goal is not to achieve perfection, but to make progress and celebrate small wins. Every step forward, no matter how small, is a step in the right direction.

Finally, I want to remind you that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and stuck. It's okay to need help and support. That's what I'm here for – to support you in finding ways to overcome these challenges and live a fulfilling life, even in the midst of adversity.

How do you feel about breaking down the task of fixing the hammer or screwdriver into smaller steps, and what are your thoughts on exploring ways to feel valued and appreciated by your kids, despite your physical limitations?

Patient: Breaking down the task of fixing the hammer or screwdriver into smaller steps sounds like a good idea. Maybe I could start by just organizing the tools better, so I know exactly what I have and what needs fixing. It's a small step, but it's something I can handle.

As for feeling valued by my kids, there was a time when Jake called me for advice on fixing something in his house. He didn't need me to do it for him, just to talk him through it. That felt good, like I was still useful in some way. But it's hard to shake the feeling that I'm not contributing enough, especially financially.

Therapist: Derek, it sounds like you're starting to make progress on breaking down the task of fixing the hammer or screwdriver into smaller, more manageable steps. Organizing the tools better is a great place to start, and it's a concrete step forward. I'm proud of you for being willing to take small steps towards your goal.

Regarding feeling valued by your kids, it's wonderful that you have a memory of Jake calling you for advice and feeling useful in that moment. That's a great example of how you can still contribute and be of value to your family, even with physical limitations. Let's explore this idea further. What if we were to brainstorm together ways in which you can continue to be of value to your kids, despite not being able to work or do things the way you used to? What are some other ways you can show your kids love and support?

It's also great that you acknowledge the financial stress and feeling of not contributing enough. We've talked about reframing negative experiences as opportunities for growth, and this is a great example of that. Instead of dwelling on what you can't do, let's focus on what you can do. What if we were to explore ways in which you can continue to contribute to your family's well-being, even in a different way? Maybe there are other skills or talents you have that can be leveraged in a way that feels meaningful to you.

As for the "Three Good Things" exercise, how have you been doing with that? Are there any specific challenges or insights you've gained from it that you'd like to share? And how do you feel about continuing to work on that exercise as part of our therapy?

Additionally, I want to leave you with a thought to consider between now and our next session. What if you were to reframe your identity and sense of purpose in a way that's not solely tied to your physical abilities? What if you were to explore ways in which you can find meaning and purpose in your life, despite your physical limitations? This might involve discovering new passions or interests, or finding ways to connect with your kids and family in different ways.

What are your thoughts on this, Derek?

Patient: I think reframing my identity and sense of purpose is a good idea. It's hard to let go of the idea that I'm only valuable if I can work and provide financially. Maybe I can find new ways to connect with my kids, like helping them with projects or just being there to listen.

As for the "Three Good Things" exercise, it's been a mixed bag. Some days it's easier to find things, and other days it feels like there's nothing good happening. But I'm trying to stick with it, even if it's just small things.

I guess I'm still figuring out how to find meaning in my life without my physical abilities. It's a work in progress, but I'm willing to keep trying.

Therapist: Derek, it sounds like you're making progress on breaking down the task of fixing the hammer or screwdriver into smaller steps. Organizing the tools better is a great starting point, and I'm proud of you for being willing to take small steps towards your goal.

What's important is that you're showing up and trying.

Regarding finding meaning and purpose in your life without your physical abilities, it's a process that takes time and exploration. It sounds like you're willing to keep trying, and that's a great first step. Let's continue to brainstorm and explore ways in which you can find meaning and purpose, even in the face of adversity.
