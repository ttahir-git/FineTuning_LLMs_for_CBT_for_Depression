Therapist: Thank you for summarizing our previous session, Derek. I'm glad to hear that you're open to trying new activities like photography. I'd like to start today's session by checking in with you about how you felt about trying photography and approaching challenges with curiosity. Can you tell me a bit more about your experiences with these exercises?

Also, I noticed that you mentioned you're resistant to accepting help or reframing negative experiences. Can you help me understand what's holding you back from exploring these ideas further? Is there a particular concern or fear that's making you hesitant to consider these concepts?

Patient: Yeah, photography... I gave it a shot. Took some pictures around my apartment. Nothing fancy, just stuff like the old tools in the garage and some of the junk I've collected over the years. It was... different. Not sure if it's really my thing, but it didn't hurt to try.

As for accepting help, it's not that I don't get it, it's just... I've always been the one people relied on. Always the one fixing things, providing. Now, I can't even do that. It feels like admitting defeat, you know? Like I'm letting everyone down, especially myself.

Therapist: It sounds like you had a bit of a mixed experience with photography. On one hand, it's great that you gave it a try and didn't feel like it was a total failure. On the other hand, you're not entirely convinced that it's something you'll continue to enjoy. That's totally okay, and I'm not here to pressure you into anything.

Regarding accepting help, I can understand why you might feel like you're admitting defeat or letting people down. It's a really tough pill to swallow when we can't be the provider or problem-solver that we once were. But I want to gently challenge that idea with you. What if accepting help wasn't about admitting defeat, but rather about being honest about your needs and limitations? What if it was okay to say, "You know what? I need some help right now, and that's okay?"

It's also possible that we can reframe this idea of accepting help as a sign of strength, rather than weakness. Think about it: when you were able to provide for your family and fix things around the house, that was a huge strength. And now, that you're not able to do those things, it doesn't mean you're any less capable or strong. It just means that your strengths are shifting, and that's okay. We can work on finding new ways to express your strength and capabilities, even if they look different now.

Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from exploring the idea of reframing negative experiences? Is there something specific that's making you hesitant to consider this concept?

Patient: Reframing negative experiences... I get what you're saying, but it feels like trying to put a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. I mean, my back is shot, I can't work, and I'm drowning in bills. How am I supposed to see that as anything but a disaster? It's not like I can just snap my fingers and feel better about it.

And as for accepting help, it's not just about feeling weak. It's about not wanting to be a burden. I've always been the one people came to for help, not the other way around. Now, I'm the one needing help, and it's... uncomfortable. I don't want to be that guy.

Therapist: Derek, I can hear the frustration and discomfort in your voice when talking about reframing negative experiences and accepting help. It's like you're feeling a sense of disloyalty to your former self, and that's a really tough thing to navigate.

First, let's take a closer look at the idea of reframing negative experiences. I want you to consider that maybe, just maybe, you're trying to see this situation through a lens that's too narrow. Instead of focusing on the fact that your back is shot and you can't work, what if we started to explore the ways in which you're still capable, despite these changes? What if we started to focus on the things that you can do, rather than the things you can't?

For example, maybe you're still able to connect with your loved ones in meaningful ways, even if it's not through physical labor. Maybe you're still able to show up for your family in ways that are just as important, even if they're different now. We can start to look at these small victories and build on them, rather than letting the negative experiences overwhelm you.

As for the idea of not wanting to be a burden, I want to gently challenge that as well. What if accepting help wasn't about being a burden, but rather about being honest about your needs? What if it was okay to say, "Hey, I need some help right now, and I'm not afraid to ask"? Think about it, Derek: when you were able to provide for your family, you didn't have to ask for help, but that didn't make it any less important. Now, it's okay to ask for help, not because you're weak, but because you're strong enough to admit when you need it.

Let's also explore the idea of reframing your sense of identity, which has been a theme in our previous sessions. You've mentioned feeling like you've lost your sense of purpose and identity since your injury. What if we started to explore ways in which you can still be a provider and a problem-solver, even if it's not in the same way as before? Maybe it's not about the specific tasks you're doing, but about the qualities you're bringing to those tasks, like compassion, empathy, or patience.

Can you tell me more about what you're hoping to achieve in our sessions, Derek? What are your goals for our work together?

Patient: My main goal? I guess I just want to feel like I'm worth something again. I used to be able to fix things, build things, provide for my family. Now, I can't even do that. I just want to feel like I'm not just a burden, you know? I want to find a way to contribute, even if it's not the same way I used to.

And yeah, I get what you're saying about reframing things. It's just... hard to see the good in a situation when everything feels like it's falling apart. But I'll try, I guess. Maybe if I can find something, anything, that makes me feel like I'm still capable, it'll help.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me, Derek. I can sense the depth of frustration and desperation you're feeling, and I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way. It's a really tough spot to be in, and I'm here to support you.

First, let's take a moment to acknowledge your strengths and capabilities. You've been a provider and a problem-solver for a long time, and those qualities don't disappear overnight. You're still a good person, a good father, and a good friend, even if your circumstances have changed.

Regarding your goal of feeling like you're worth something again, I want to assure you that this is a completely normal and valid goal. It's not uncommon for people to feel like they've lost their sense of purpose or identity when faced with significant changes. But here's the thing: you are still worth something, no matter what your physical abilities are or what challenges you're facing. You're a human being with inherent value and worth, regardless of your accomplishments or abilities.

Now, let's talk about reframing negative experiences. I want to encourage you to take small steps towards exploring this concept. Can we start by identifying one small, manageable goal that you'd like to achieve? It doesn't have to be related to photography or anything specific, just something that feels achievable and positive. Once we've identified that goal, we can start to work on reframing the negative thoughts and emotions that might be holding you back.

Additionally, I want to introduce a new exercise to help you build on the small victories I mentioned earlier. It's called the "Three Good Things" exercise. Each day, I want you to take a few minutes to reflect on three things that went well, no matter how small they might seem. This can be anything from a good conversation with a family member to a nice cup of coffee to a beautiful sunset. By focusing on the positive aspects of your life, we can start to build on those small victories and create a more optimistic outlook.

How does that sound, Derek? Are you willing to give the "Three Good Things" exercise a try?

Patient: Yeah, I can give that a shot. Three good things, huh? I guess it's worth a try. I'll start today and see what I can come up with.

As for a small goal, I've been thinking about maybe trying to fix up some of my old woodworking tools. They're just sitting there, gathering dust. I can't do the heavy stuff anymore, but maybe I can get them working again. It's something I used to enjoy, and it might give me a sense of accomplishment.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making some progress, Derek. I'm glad to hear that you're willing to give the "Three Good Things" exercise a try. Remember, it's not about finding three major accomplishments, but rather about acknowledging and appreciating the small, positive moments in your day.

Regarding your goal of fixing up your old woodworking tools, that's a great start. It's wonderful that you're thinking about something you used to enjoy and that might give you a sense of accomplishment. Let's break down this goal into smaller, manageable steps. For example, you could start by dusting off the tools, cleaning them, and then assessing what needs to be fixed or repaired. That way, you can focus on making progress, one step at a time.

Also, I want to remind you that it's okay to start small and celebrate your successes along the way. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to achieve everything at once. By focusing on the process, rather than the end result, you can build your confidence and sense of accomplishment.

Now, let's schedule a homework assignment for you. For the next week, I want you to practice the "Three Good Things" exercise each day. Write them down in a journal or on a sticky note, and reflect on why these things are positive and meaningful to you. Also, take small steps towards fixing up your woodworking tools. Clean them, assess what needs to be done, and make a plan for how you'll tackle the project.

Before we wrap up today's session, I want to leave you with a final thought. Remember that reframing negative experiences is not about ignoring or denying the difficulties you're facing, but rather about finding ways to approach them with a more optimistic and hopeful mindset. It's okay to acknowledge the challenges, but try to see them as opportunities for growth and learning.

How do you feel about this homework assignment, Derek? Are you willing to give it a try?

Additionally, I want to suggest that we schedule a follow-up session for next week, so we can check in on your progress and make any adjustments as needed. Would that work for you?

Patient: Yeah, I'll give the homework a try. Writing down three good things each day and working on the tools sounds doable. I'll see how it goes.

As for the follow-up session, that works for me. Let's schedule it for next week. I'll keep track of how things are going and we can talk about it then.

Therapist: It seems like the session has concluded, and the therapist has provided the patient with a homework assignment and a follow-up session scheduled for next week. Here's a possible response from the therapist to wrap up the conversation:.

Patient: Great, Derek. I'm glad to hear that you're willing to give the homework a try and that you're open to our follow-up session next week. Remember, it's all about taking small steps and celebrating the progress you make, no matter how small it may seem.

I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences with the "Three Good Things" exercise and how you're progressing with your woodworking tools. If you have any questions or need support before our next session, don't hesitate to reach out.

Take care, and I'll see you next week.

Therapist: Here's a possible response from the therapist to wrap up the conversation:
