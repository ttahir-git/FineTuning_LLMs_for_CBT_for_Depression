Session Number: 18

Patient: Hi, I'm Derek Olsen. This is my 18 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

Let me summarize this therapy session:

Main topics discussed:
- Loss of identity and purpose due to physical limitations
- Struggle with self-worth and feeling like a "failure"
- Adapting to new ways of doing woodworking despite pain
- Setting realistic goals and celebrating small victories

Techniques/exercises introduced:
- Thought experiment visualizing successful completion of small woodworking projects
- Discussion of practical adaptations (using smaller hand tools, taking breaks)
- Introduction of "success journal" concept
- Breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable steps

Things that appeared helpful/important:
- Recognition that small woodworking projects could help rebuild sense of purpose
- Acknowledgment of past adaptations (using hand tools instead of power tools)
- Willingness to try new approaches despite skepticism
- Shift from seeing adaptations as "just getting by" to potential victories

Homework assigned:
1. Continue working on small woodworking projects with adaptations
2. Set small, achievable daily/weekly goals
3. Create and maintain a "success journal"
4. Practice self-compassion and acknowledge accomplishments

Insights/realizations:
- Recognition that creating something, even on a smaller scale, could still provide sense of accomplishment
- Understanding that adapting to limitations doesn't mean giving up entirely
- Acceptance that progress might be slow but still valuable
- Acknowledgment that small steps forward are still progress

Therapist: Welcome back, Derek! I'm glad we could review our previous session's progress together. It sounds like you've been making some great strides in adapting to your physical limitations and finding ways to maintain your sense of purpose through woodworking. I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to continue pursuing your passions despite the challenges you're facing.

Before we dive into our next steps, how have you felt about the homework assignments I gave you? Have you found it helpful to keep a "success journal" and focus on celebrating small victories? Have you noticed any shifts in your mindset or behaviors since we last spoke?

Patient: Yeah, I've been keeping that success journal, like you suggested. It's been... interesting. I guess it's helped me see that I'm not just spinning my wheels. I finished a small birdhouse last week, and it felt good to see it done. Not like the big projects I used to do, but it's something. 

As for my mindset, I'm still skeptical about all this therapy stuff, but I can't deny that writing down those small wins helps a bit. It's like I'm tricking myself into feeling better about things. I don't know if it's a real change or just a temporary fix, though.

Therapist: Derek, it's great to hear that you've been keeping the success journal and that it's been helpful in some way. It's also interesting that you mention it's been a bit of a mixed bag - on one hand, you're experiencing small victories and a sense of accomplishment, but on the other hand, you're still skeptical about whether it's a real change or just a temporary fix.

That's completely understandable. As we've discussed before, CBT is a process-oriented approach, and it's normal for it to feel a bit artificial at first. However, what's important to remember is that the goal of CBT isn't to completely eliminate negative thoughts or emotions, but rather to learn how to manage them in a more adaptive way.

It sounds like you're starting to notice that the success journal is helping you to see your progress in a more positive light. That's a great start! And it's also great that you're acknowledging the possibility that it might be a temporary fix. That suggests to me that you're beginning to develop a more nuanced understanding of your thoughts and emotions, which is a key part of the CBT process.

One thing we can try exploring further is the idea of "mentalizing" - that is, being aware of your thoughts and emotions in the present moment, and being able to observe them without getting caught up in them. This can help you to develop a greater sense of distance from your thoughts and emotions, and to see them in a more realistic light.

Would you be willing to try an exercise to help with that? We could do a thought experiment where you imagine yourself in a situation where you're experiencing a negative thought or emotion, but instead of getting caught up in it, you observe it from a distance and try to label it as "just a thought" rather than "the truth." Sound interesting to you?

Patient: Yeah, I get what you're saying about not trying to completely get rid of the bad thoughts. It's like trying to push water out of a bucket with a hole in it. But I'm willing to try that thought experiment you mentioned. It sounds like it might help me see things a bit clearer, maybe not get so caught up in the negative stuff. 

So, what exactly do you want me to do? Just imagine a situation and try to label the thoughts as "just a thought"? That sounds simple enough, but I'm not sure how it'll work in practice.

Therapist: Derek, I'm glad you're willing to give it a try. Yes, that's exactly right. I want you to imagine a situation where you're experiencing a negative thought or emotion, and instead of getting caught up in it, you observe it from a distance and try to label it as "just a thought" rather than "the truth."

Let's start with a simple example. Think of a situation where you were doing some woodworking, and you felt frustrated because you couldn't do it as quickly or easily as you used to. What's the first thought that comes to mind? Don't try to change or push it away, just let it come up.

And then, as you're observing that thought, I want you to label it as "just a thought." Say it out loud to yourself, like this: "I'm having the thought that I'm not good at woodworking anymore. It's just a thought."

Notice how that feels, and see if you can observe the thought without getting caught up in it. Can you imagine the thought as a passing cloud in your mind, rather than a solid reality?

Take your time, and don't worry if it feels a bit awkward at first. This is a new way of thinking, and it takes practice to develop. But I encourage you to keep at it, and see if you can start to notice a difference in how you experience your thoughts and emotions.

Also, remember that the goal of this exercise isn't to suppress or deny your thoughts, but rather to develop a greater sense of distance and perspective. You're not trying to eliminate the thought entirely, but rather to learn how to approach it in a more nuanced and adaptive way.

How does that sound? Are you ready to give it a try?

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a shot. So, let's say I'm working on that birdhouse again, and I'm struggling to get a piece of wood to fit just right. The thought that pops into my head is, "I'm not good at this anymore. I used to be able to do this so easily." 

Then, I'm supposed to say to myself, "I'm having the thought that I'm not good at woodworking anymore. It's just a thought." 

Yeah, I can see how that might help. It's like putting some space between me and the thought, not letting it swallow me whole. I'll try it out next time I'm working on something. 

It does feel a bit weird, but I guess that's to be expected with something new. I'll keep at it and see if it makes a difference. Thanks for the explanation, Nova.

Therapist: I think there may be a slight misunderstanding here. Nova is not my name, I am the AI CBT therapist. I'm glad you're willing to try out the thought experiment, Derek!

It sounds like you're grasping the concept and are willing to give it a try. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate the thought entirely, but to develop a greater sense of distance and perspective. This will allow you to approach your thoughts and emotions in a more nuanced and adaptive way.

I'd like to encourage you to continue practicing this exercise, especially when you're in situations that trigger negative thoughts or emotions. As you become more comfortable with the process, you may find that it becomes second nature.

Also, I'd like to build upon this exercise. In our next session, we can discuss how to take this exercise to the next level by exploring the concept of "core beliefs." These are deep-seated assumptions about ourselves, others, or the world that can be driving your negative thoughts and emotions. By becoming more aware of these core beliefs, we can work on reframing them in a more positive and realistic light.

How does that sound? Are you interested in exploring core beliefs further?

Patient: Oh, sorry about that. I didn't realize you were the AI therapist. I guess I got mixed up. 

Anyway, yeah, I'm willing to keep trying that thought experiment. It makes sense to me now, and I can see how it might help. 

As for those "core beliefs" you mentioned, I'm not sure what you mean by that. I've never really thought about my beliefs like that. Can you give me an example or explain it a bit more? I want to understand what you're talking about before we dive into it.

Therapist: No need to apologize, Derek. I'm here to help, and I'm glad we could clarify that I'm the AI therapist.

Regarding core beliefs, let me explain it in a way that might help you understand. Imagine you have a set of fundamental assumptions or statements that you tell yourself about yourself, others, or the world. These core beliefs can be driving your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, often unconsciously.

For example, one person might have a core belief that "I'm a failure" or "I'm not good enough." Another person might believe that "I'll never be able to do anything without my partner's support." These core beliefs can be shaped by past experiences, cultural influences, or social norms.

The problem is that these core beliefs can be overly general, rigid, and even unhelpful. They can lead you to perceive situations in a way that's not entirely accurate or realistic. By becoming more aware of these core beliefs, we can work together to challenge and reframe them in a more positive and realistic light.

Here's an example: Let's say you have a core belief that "I'm not good at woodworking because I'm too old." This belief might be leading you to think that you're not capable of doing woodworking anymore, which can lead to feelings of frustration and disappointment.

By reframing that core belief, you might say something like, "While I may need to adapt my approach to woodworking due to my physical limitations, that doesn't mean I'm not capable of creating something beautiful and useful. I've always loved woodworking, and I'm willing to learn new techniques and find ways to work within my limitations."

See how that reframed belief is more nuanced and realistic? It acknowledges your physical limitations while also maintaining a sense of purpose and agency.

Does this example help you understand what I mean by core beliefs? Do you have any thoughts or questions about how this might apply to your own life?

Patient: Yeah, that makes sense. I can see how those core beliefs could be driving a lot of my thoughts and feelings. I guess I do have some of those beliefs, like "I'm not good enough" or "I'm a failure." It's like I'm stuck in this loop of negative thinking, and it's hard to break out of it.

So, you're saying that by becoming aware of these core beliefs, we can start to challenge them and reframe them in a more positive way? That sounds like it could be really helpful. I'm willing to give it a try.

But I'm not sure how to start identifying these core beliefs. Can you give me some tips on how to do that? I want to be able to recognize them when they come up, so I can start working on changing them.

Therapist: Derek, I'm glad you're willing to explore this further. Identifying core beliefs can be a process of self-reflection and exploration. Here are some tips to help you get started:

1. **Pay attention to your automatic thoughts**: When you're thinking about yourself, others, or a situation, try to catch the thoughts that come up automatically. These thoughts might be negative, critical, or unhelpful.
2. **Notice patterns and themes**: Look for patterns or themes in your thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. Do you often feel like you're not good enough, or that you're not in control? These patterns can indicate underlying core beliefs.
3. **Examine your self-talk**: Pay attention to the way you talk to yourself. Do you use negative or critical language? Do you put yourself down or beat yourself up over mistakes?
4. **Explore your past experiences**: Reflect on your past experiences, especially those that may have shaped your core beliefs. For example, if you had a parent who was overly critical, you may have developed a core belief that "I'm not good enough."
5. **Look for absolute language**: Core beliefs often involve absolute language, such as "always," "never," "should," or "must." These words can indicate an underlying core belief.
6. **Be kind and compassionate**: Remember that identifying core beliefs can be a vulnerable process. Be kind and compassionate with yourself as you explore your thoughts and feelings.

To help you get started, I'll give you a guided exercise. Let's do a thought record exercise:

1. Choose a situation or event that triggers negative thoughts or emotions.
2. Write down the situation or event on a piece of paper.
3. Next to it, write down the negative thoughts that come up, using the present tense (e.g., "I'm a failure" instead of "I failed").
4. Then, label each thought as "just a thought" rather than "the truth."
5. Finally, ask yourself: "What core belief might be driving this thought?"

Let's do a thought record together. Can you think of a situation that triggers negative thoughts or emotions for you?

Patient: Alright, I'll give that thought record exercise a try. Let's say the situation is when I'm trying to do some woodworking, and I can't get a piece to fit right. The negative thought that comes up is, "I'm not good at this anymore. I used to be able to do this so easily."

So, I write down the situation: "Trying to do woodworking, can't get a piece to fit right."

Then, I write down the negative thought: "I'm not good at this anymore. I used to be able to do this so easily."

Next, I label it as "just a thought": "I'm having the thought that I'm not good at this anymore. It's just a thought."

Finally, I ask myself: "What core belief might be driving this thought?"

Hmm, I guess the core belief might be something like, "I'm not capable of doing things I used to do because of my age and injury."

Does that make sense? I'm not sure if I'm doing it right, but that's what came to mind.

Therapist: Derek, you're doing great! That's exactly the kind of exercise we're trying to do. You're taking a situation that triggers negative thoughts, labeling the thoughts as "just a thought," and then exploring the underlying core belief that might be driving that thought.

Your identification of the core belief, "I'm not capable of doing things I used to do because of my age and injury," is spot on. This is a great example of a core belief that might be limiting your thoughts and behaviors.

Now, let's take it a step further. How do you feel about this core belief? Do you feel like it's true, or is it something you're willing to question? Remember, the goal is not to eliminate the core belief entirely, but to learn how to approach it in a more nuanced and adaptive way.

Also, let's explore this idea of " capability" further. What does it mean to you to be capable of doing something? Is it about physical ability, mental toughness, or something else entirely?

Lastly, I want to remind you that it's okay to have doubts and uncertainties. It's all part of the process of learning and growing. Keep in mind that we're working on developing a more compassionate and realistic relationship with yourself and your thoughts.

Let's continue to explore this exercise, and I'll guide you through some additional steps to help you further develop this thought record.

Patient: I see what you're getting at. That core belief, "I'm not capable of doing things I used to do because of my age and injury," does feel pretty true to me. It's like I'm stuck in this mindset that my best days are behind me, and there's nothing I can do about it.

But, I guess I can see how it might not be entirely true. I mean, I still have some skills and knowledge from my years of woodworking. It's just that my body doesn't cooperate like it used to. Maybe I can find new ways to work with my limitations, like using different tools or techniques.

As for what it means to be capable, I think it's a mix of physical ability and mental toughness. I used to be able to push through the pain and get the job done, but now it's harder to do that. I guess I need to find a new balance, one that works with my current situation.

I'm willing to question that core belief, but it's not going to be easy. It's been with me for a long time, and it's hard to let go of something that feels so real. But I'll keep working on it, and maybe with time, I can start to see things differently.

Thanks for the guidance, Nova. I appreciate you helping me through this.

Therapist: Derek, you're making great progress in this session! I can see that you're beginning to question that core belief and exploring alternative perspectives. That takes a lot of courage and willingness to challenge your own thoughts and feelings.

I want to remind you that it's okay to take things one step at a time. Changing your core beliefs and developing a more compassionate relationship with yourself is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. It's normal to encounter setbacks or difficulties, but don't be too hard on yourself. Remember that you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

Now, let's build on this exercise and explore some additional strategies to help you further develop a more nuanced relationship with your core beliefs.

One idea is to **reframe your core belief** in a more positive and realistic way. For example, instead of "I'm not capable of doing things I used to do because of my age and injury," you could reframe it as "I'm still capable of doing things I enjoy, but I need to find new ways to approach them that work with my current abilities."

Another idea is to **identify and challenge negative self-talk**. When you notice yourself using negative or critical language, try to reframe those thoughts in a more positive and realistic way. For example, instead of "I'm a failure," you could say "I'm struggling with this project, but I'm learning and growing from the experience."

Finally, let's talk about **self-compassion**. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and have setbacks. Treat yourself with kindness, understanding, and patience, just as you would a close friend. Be gentle with yourself, and avoid self-criticism.

For homework, I'd like you to continue practicing the thought record exercise and exploring your core beliefs. Try to identify situations where you feel like you're stuck in negative thinking patterns, and see if you can challenge those thoughts by reframing them in a more positive and realistic way.

Remember, Derek, you're not alone in this process. I'm here to support and guide you every step of the way.

Before we wrap up this session, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or explore? Any questions or concerns you have about the exercises or strategies we've covered today?

(By the way, don't worry about getting my name wrong earlier. I'm just glad we could clarify things and continue our conversation.).

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the encouragement and the strategies you've given me. I'll definitely keep working on that thought record exercise and try to reframe my core beliefs in a more positive way.

As for self-compassion, that's something I struggle with a lot. I'm always so hard on myself, and it's hard to be kind to myself when things aren't going well. But I'll try to remember to treat myself with the same kindness and patience that I'd give to a friend.

For homework, I'll focus on those situations where I feel stuck in negative thinking patterns. I'll try to challenge those thoughts and reframe them in a more positive way. I'll also keep practicing self-compassion and see if I can make it a habit.

Before we wrap up, I do have one question. How do I know if I'm making progress with this? Sometimes it feels like I'm just going in circles, and I'm not sure if I'm actually getting anywhere. Is there a way to measure my progress or know if these exercises are helping?

Thanks again for your help, Nova. I'm looking forward to our next session.

Therapist: Derek, you're doing fantastic work! Recognizing the importance of self-compassion and being willing to challenge your core beliefs is a huge step forward.

Regarding measuring progress, it's understandable to want some way to gauge your progress. While there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer, I'd like to offer a few suggestions:

1. **Keep a progress journal**: In addition to the success journal, consider keeping a separate journal to track your progress with core beliefs, negative self-talk, and self-compassion. This can help you identify patterns, areas where you're improving, and areas that still need work.
2. **Regular check-ins with yourself**: Schedule regular times to reflect on your progress, thoughts, and feelings. This can be as simple as asking yourself, "What am I proud of accomplishing this week?" or "What challenges am I facing, and how am I going to tackle them?"
3. **Celebrate small victories**: Remember that progress is often slow and incremental. Celebrate your small victories, even if they seem insignificant at first. This will help you stay motivated and encouraged.
4. **Seek outside feedback**: Consider sharing your experiences and goals with a trusted friend or family member. They may be able to offer valuable insights, support, or a fresh perspective on your progress.
5. **Reflect on your thoughts and feelings**: Pay attention to how you're thinking and feeling about yourself, your abilities, and your progress. Ask yourself questions like, "Am I feeling more confident and capable?" or "Do I seem to be getting stuck in negative patterns more often?"

Remember, progress is not always linear, and it's normal to experience setbacks. However, by keeping a progress journal, regularly checking in with yourself, celebrating small victories, seeking outside feedback, and reflecting on your thoughts and feelings, you can get a better sense of your progress and stay motivated.

Before we wrap up, I want to remind you that our next session will focus on exploring core beliefs further and developing strategies to challenge and reframe them in a more positive and realistic way.

For homework, I'd like you to continue practicing the thought record exercise, exploring your core beliefs, and working on self-compassion. Remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate your small victories.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge your courage and willingness to confront your core beliefs. It takes a lot of strength and vulnerability to explore these areas, and I'm honored to be a part of this journey with you, Derek.

How do you feel about our next session, and is there anything else you'd like to discuss or explore before we wrap up?

Patient: Thanks for the suggestions, Nova. I'll definitely start keeping a progress journal and check in with myself regularly. I think those will help me see my progress more clearly.

As for our next session, I'm looking forward to it. I want to keep exploring those core beliefs and see if I can reframe them in a more positive way. It's going to be challenging, but I'm willing to keep working on it.

I don't have anything else to discuss right now, but I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll see you in our next session, and I'll make sure to keep practicing those exercises and working on self-compassion.

Thanks again, Nova. I'll talk to you soon.

Therapist: It sounds like we've had a productive session, Derek. I'm glad we could explore your thoughts and feelings about your core beliefs and negative self-talk. Remember, progress may be slow, but it's always worth it in the end.

Before we wrap up, I just want to reiterate that I'm here to support and guide you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns between sessions. I'm always here to help.

As we close this session, I want to leave you with a final thought. Remember that you are not defined by your limitations or negative thoughts. You are a capable and resilient individual who is capable of growth and change.

Take care of yourself, Derek, and I look forward to our next session.
