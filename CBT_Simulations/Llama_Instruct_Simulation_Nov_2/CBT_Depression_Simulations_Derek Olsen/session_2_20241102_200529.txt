- Provided important feedback about feeling misunderstood and that assumptions were being made

Homework assigned:

Note: The session revealed some issues with therapeutic alliance and the need to better align with the client's actual experiences rather than making assumptions about their feelings and thoughts.

Therapist: Welcome back to our session, Derek. Thank you for taking the time to review the notes from our previous session. I want to start by acknowledging that I made some errors in our last session that may have led to feelings of being misunderstood. I want to assure you that I'm committed to doing better in our sessions together.

Can you tell me, how do you feel about our progress so far? Have you had a chance to try any of the exercises I suggested, such as gratitude journaling or values exploration? What did you think of them, and how did you find the experience?

Patient: Yeah, I gave those exercises a shot. The gratitude journaling was... okay. I wrote down three things I was grateful for, like my kids and the fact that I still have a roof over my head. But it felt kinda forced, you know? Like I was just writing stuff down to make it look good.

As for the values thing, I didn't really get it. What's the point of thinking about what's important to me now? My life's a mess, and I don't see how that's gonna change anything. I need something more concrete, something that'll actually help me get through the day without feeling like a failure.

Therapist: Derek, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to share your thoughts and feelings about our previous exercises. I completely understand your skepticism, and I'm glad we could discuss this further. 

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that gratitude journaling can feel forced or artificial, especially when you're going through a difficult time. That's okay. It's not about forcing it or pretending to be grateful when you're not. Instead, let's reframe it as an opportunity to practice mindfulness and presence in the midst of chaos. Perhaps we can try something different, like exploring what small, everyday moments bring you a sense of comfort or peace, even if it's just for a brief moment. 

Regarding the values exploration, I understand your concern that it may seem abstract or irrelevant. However, exploring your core values can actually help us identify potential small wins and areas where you can make progress towards your goals. It's not about changing your situation overnight, but about identifying what matters most to you and using those values as a guiding light to make decisions and take steps towards a more meaningful life. Can you tell me, what does it mean to you when you think about feeling like a failure? Is it related to not being able to do woodworking or fishing, or is it something more specific?

Patient: Feeling like a failure... it's everything, really. I used to be able to build stuff with my hands, fix things around the house, and provide for my family. Now, I can't even lift a hammer without my back screaming at me. My kids don't call much anymore, and I can't blame them. I'm behind on child support, and I know they're struggling too. It's like I've lost my whole identity. 

I guess if I had to pick something more specific, it's the fact that I can't provide anymore. I used to be the guy everyone could count on, and now I'm just a burden. I don't see how thinking about what's important to me is gonna change that. I need something that'll help me get back on my feet, not just talk about what I value.

Therapist: Derek, I can feel the weight of your struggles, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. It sounds like the feelings of failure are closely tied to your loss of identity and ability to provide for your family. I want to acknowledge that this is a huge blow, and it's understandable that you're struggling to see a way forward.

While it's true that thinking about values can seem abstract, I want to assure you that it's not just about abstract ideas. In fact, exploring your values can help us identify what small steps you can take towards rebuilding your sense of purpose and identity. It's not about changing your situation overnight, but about finding ways to reclaim a sense of control and agency in your life.

I'd like to propose a different approach. Instead of just talking about values, let's focus on identifying small, tangible goals that you can work towards, one step at a time. Perhaps we can start with something as simple as taking a short walk each day or engaging in a small hobby that brings you joy, despite your back pain. By building on these small successes, we can start to build momentum and confidence.

Regarding your concerns about child support and feeling like a burden, I want to acknowledge that those are real and significant challenges. However, I'd like to explore whether there might be some underlying fears or negative self-talk that's contributing to these feelings. Are you beating yourself up over past mistakes, or feeling like you're a bad person for not being able to provide? Sometimes, our negative self-talk can be more hurtful than our circumstances themselves.

Let's work together to challenge some of those negative thoughts and explore more balanced, compassionate perspectives. I'm not here to minimize your struggles, but to support you in finding ways to cope and move forward, even in the midst of difficulty. What do you think? Is there anything specific that you'd like to work on or talk about in our session today?

Patient: I appreciate the effort, but I'm still not sure how taking a walk or doing a small hobby is gonna fix my problems. I mean, I can't even afford to pay my bills, let alone think about doing something for fun. And as for the negative self-talk, yeah, I do beat myself up a lot. I keep thinking about how I let my kids down, how I can't provide for them like I used to. It's a constant loop in my head.

I guess what I'd really like to talk about is how to get out of this financial hole. I've been looking for odd jobs, but with my back, it's hard to find anything that pays enough to make a difference. I need something that'll help me get back on my feet, not just feel better for a moment.

Therapist: Derek, I completely understand your skepticism and frustration. It's clear that you're struggling with a lot of practical challenges, and it's hard to see how small steps towards self-care or exploration of values will make a tangible difference. I want to assure you that I'm not asking you to put on a brave face or pretend to be okay when you're not. 

It's true that our previous exercises may not have directly addressed your financial concerns. However, I want to suggest that the small steps we talk about don't have to be about grand, elaborate plans. Sometimes, it's the smallest, most incremental changes that can have a significant impact over time.

For example, have you considered reaching out to a local non-profit organization that provides financial assistance to people in your situation? Or exploring online resources that might help you find low-cost or no-cost activities that you can do despite your back pain? 

Regarding your negative self-talk, I'd like to propose a different way of framing those thoughts. Instead of beating yourself up over past mistakes, let's try to reframe those experiences as opportunities for growth and learning. What did you learn from those experiences, and how can you apply those lessons to your current situation? By reframing your mistakes as learning opportunities, you may be able to shift your focus away from guilt and shame and towards a more hopeful, constructive narrative.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge that your financial situation is a critical concern, and we'll definitely explore ways to address it. However, I'd also like to suggest that there may be other, more subtle factors at play that contribute to your feelings of being a burden. Are there any other relationships in your life, beyond your family, that you feel a sense of responsibility or obligation towards? 

Let's explore these areas further and see if we can identify any potential entry points for change. What do you think?

Patient: I appreciate the suggestions, but I'm not sure about reaching out to non-profits. I've always been the one helping others, not the other way around. It feels like admitting defeat. As for online resources, I'll look into that, but I'm not holding my breath.

Reframing my mistakes as learning opportunities... I get what you're saying, but it's hard to see it that way when I'm still dealing with the consequences. I lost my job, my family's struggling, and I can't even do the things I used to love. It's hard to find the silver lining in all that.

As for other relationships, I don't really have any outside of my family. My friends from work drifted away after the injury, and I haven't made any new ones. It's just me and the TV most days.

I guess what I'm looking for is something more immediate, something that'll give me a sense of accomplishment or control. I don't know what that is yet, but I'm open to ideas.

Therapist: I appreciate your honesty, Derek. It's clear that you're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to see a way forward. I want to assure you that I'm not asking you to do anything that feels like admitting defeat or giving up. Instead, I'm here to support you in finding ways to cope and make progress, even in the midst of difficulty.

I want to acknowledge that reaching out to non-profits or online resources might feel like a step back for you. That's okay. Instead, let's focus on exploring other areas where you might be able to find a sense of control or accomplishment. For example, we could brainstorm ways for you to reconnect with your family or rebuild relationships with old friends. Perhaps there's a small project or activity that you can take on, despite your back pain, that would give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment.

Regarding reframing your mistakes as learning opportunities, I understand that it's hard to see it that way right now. However, I want to suggest that we take small steps towards this perspective. Can you think of one specific experience or mistake from the past that you've been beating yourself up over? Let's take that experience and try to identify what you learned from it. What would you do differently if you had the chance? By exploring this experience in a more nuanced way, we may be able to start to shift your focus away from guilt and shame and towards a more constructive narrative.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge that you're feeling a lack of sense of control and accomplishment. I want to assure you that we can work together to find ways to address this. Perhaps we can identify small, manageable tasks that you can complete each day or week that would give you a sense of progress and momentum. It might be something as simple as cooking a meal, doing a load of laundry, or taking a short walk. By building on these small successes, we can start to build confidence and a sense of control.

What do you think? Is there anything specific that you'd like to work on or talk about in our session today?

Patient: I appreciate the support, but I'm still not sure about the whole reframing thing. I get what you're saying, but it's hard to see the lessons when I'm still dealing with the fallout. 

As for reconnecting with my family or friends, I've tried reaching out to my kids, but they're busy with their own lives. And my old friends from work, well, they've moved on. I don't blame them, but it's hard to start over.

Maybe we could focus on something more immediate, like finding a small project or activity that I can do despite my back pain. I used to love woodworking, but I can't do that anymore. Maybe there's something else I could try, something that doesn't require a lot of physical effort but still gives me a sense of accomplishment. Any ideas?

Therapist: I'm glad we could continue the conversation. I think it's great that you're open to exploring new ideas, despite feeling skeptical at times.

Considering your interest in finding a new activity that doesn't require a lot of physical effort, I'd like to propose a few options. Since woodworking is no longer an option, perhaps we could explore other hobbies or crafts that might appeal to you. For example, have you ever considered:

1. Painting or drawing? These activities can be done while seated, and you don't need to exert yourself physically. You might find that it brings you a sense of calm and creative expression.
2. Photography? You could take photos of nature, objects, or even your family. This could be a great way to explore your creativity while still being able to manage your physical limitations.
3. Writing? You could start a journal, write short stories, or even maintain a blog. This could help you process your thoughts and emotions, and might provide a sense of accomplishment and control.
4. Music or singing? If you enjoy music, you might consider listening to or playing soothing music, or even singing along to your favorite songs. This could be a great way to relax and express yourself.

These are just a few ideas to get you started. What do you think? Is any of these options something you'd be interested in exploring further?

Also, I want to acknowledge that you've been feeling a sense of isolation and disconnection from your loved ones. I'm here to support you in finding ways to reconnect and build stronger relationships. Perhaps we can brainstorm some ideas for small, low-key activities that you can do with your family or friends, despite your physical limitations. What do you think?

Patient: I appreciate the suggestions, but I'm not really into painting or drawing. I've never been artistic like that. Photography could be interesting, though. I used to enjoy taking pictures when I was younger, and it wouldn't require much physical effort. I could start with my phone and see where it goes.

As for reconnecting with my family, I'm not sure what kind of activities we could do together. My kids are busy with their own lives, and I don't want to be a burden. Maybe we could try something simple, like a phone call or a video chat. I know they're not big on that, but it's a start.

I'm still not convinced about the whole reframing thing, but I'll give it some thought. Maybe there's something there that I'm missing. For now, I'd like to focus on trying out photography and seeing if it brings me any sense of accomplishment or peace.

Therapist: It sounds like we've made some progress in our conversation today, Derek. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and that we can adjust our approach as needed. I'm glad you're open to exploring photography as a potential activity that brings you a sense of accomplishment and peace.

Regarding the reframing exercise, I understand that it may not be resonating with you right now. That's okay. We can continue to explore this idea at a later time, and see if it becomes more relevant or helpful for you.

For now, let's focus on the photography project. I encourage you to start with your phone and see where it takes you. You can explore different types of photography, such as nature, still-life, or even portrait photography. Who knows, you might discover a new passion!

Also, I want to suggest that we schedule a follow-up session for next week, where we can check in on your progress with photography and see if you're feeling more engaged or fulfilled. We can also continue to brainstorm ideas for reconnecting with your family and friends, and explore other ways to build stronger relationships.

Before we wrap up today's session, I want to leave you with a thought-provoking question, Derek. What would happen if you were to approach your current situation with a sense of curiosity, rather than frustration or despair? What might you discover about yourself or your capabilities if you were to approach this challenge with a growth mindset?

Take some time to reflect on this question, and we can discuss it further in our next session.

Lastly, I want to reiterate my commitment to supporting you in your journey, Derek. I'm here to listen, guide, and help you find ways to cope with your challenges. Remember that you're not alone in this, and that we can work together to find solutions that bring you greater peace and fulfillment.

Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or explore before we wrap up today's session?

Patient: I appreciate the support and the follow-up session idea. I'll give the photography a try and see how it goes. As for the thought-provoking question, I'll think about it. It's hard to approach things with curiosity when I'm so deep in this hole, but maybe there's something to it.

I don't have anything else to discuss right now. I'll see you next week, and we can talk more about how things are going with the photography and anything else that comes up.

Therapist: It seems like we've made some good progress in our conversation today, Derek. I appreciate your willingness to explore new ideas, despite feeling skeptical at times. I'm glad we could discuss your concerns and work together to find ways to address them.

Before we wrap up today's session, I want to summarize some of the key takeaways and action items we discussed:

1. We explored the idea of reframing negative thoughts and emotions, and you're willing to give it some thought.
2. We discussed potential activities that might bring you a sense of accomplishment and peace, such as photography.
3. We brainstormed ideas for reconnecting with your family and friends, such as phone calls or video chats.
4. We scheduled a follow-up session for next week to check in on your progress with photography and explore other areas for growth.

As we move forward, I want to encourage you to approach your current situation with a sense of curiosity, rather than frustration or despair. This might help you discover new insights and possibilities for growth.

Before we conclude, I want to leave you with a few homework assignments to work on between now and our next session:

1. Start exploring photography as a potential activity that brings you a sense of accomplishment and peace.
2. Reach out to your family and friends to reconnect and build stronger relationships.
3. Reflect on the thought-provoking question I left you with: What would happen if you were to approach your current situation with a sense of curiosity, rather than frustration or despair?

Remember, Derek, you're not alone in this journey. I'm here to support you, listen to you, and help you find ways to cope with your challenges. Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
