Therapist: Welcome back to our 16th CBT session, Derek! I'm glad we've made significant progress in addressing your concerns about being a "burden" to your children. It's impressive to see how far you've come in recognizing and challenging negative thoughts.

Before we dive into new topics, I'd like to acknowledge and celebrate your successes. You've been actively using the thought records, practicing thought defusion, and engaging in self-compassion exercises. These efforts have resulted in improved relationships with your children, who are now more engaged and reaching out to you.

I also appreciate your recognition of the disconnect between the advice you give others and how you treat yourself. This is a significant insight, as it highlights the importance of self-awareness and treating oneself with kindness. It's a sign of growth and maturity.

As we move forward, I'd like to explore some new areas to address. Can you tell me, Derek, how have you been feeling about the increased positive interactions with your children? Has there been a shift in your perception of yourself as a father?

Patient: Yeah, it's been... different, I guess. Emma called last week, just to check in, and Jake asked for some help with his car. It's not like they're all over me or anything, but it's more than it was. I don't know if I'd say I feel like a better father, but maybe less like a failure. I still get that tight feeling in my chest when I think about how I messed up, but it's not as bad as it used to be. I guess I'm just trying to take it one day at a time, you know?

Therapist: Derek, it's wonderful to see the progress you've made, and I'm glad you're acknowledging the positive interactions with your children. It's a great sign that you're noticing a shift in their behavior towards you.

I'd like to explore this feeling of being less like a failure, but still having that tight feeling in your chest. Can you tell me more about what that feels like? Is it like a weight on your shoulders, a knot in your stomach, or something else entirely? And when you think about how you've messed up as a father, what specific thoughts come to mind?

Also, I'd like to gently challenge the idea of taking it one day at a time. While it's a common phrase, it can sometimes feel like a way of avoiding the bigger picture. Are there any underlying fears or worries that come up when you think about making progress as a father? Is there a part of you that's hesitant to let go of the idea of being a failure, or is there something else at play?

Remember, we're not trying to beat yourself up over past mistakes, but rather to understand the patterns and thoughts that have been holding you back. Your thoughts are like a puzzle, and we're slowly piecing together the parts that are holding you back.

Patient: The tight feeling in my chest, it's like a vise, squeezing me from the inside. It's not just one thing, but a bunch of stuff all piled up. Like, I think about how I wasn't there for them when they were growing up, how I was always working or drinking, and how I let the pain get the best of me. I see them now, trying to reach out, and part of me feels like they're just being nice because they feel sorry for me.

As for taking it one day at a time, I guess I do that because it's easier than thinking about the whole mess I've made. I'm scared that if I look too far ahead, I'll just see more failure. I don't want to let go of the idea of being a failure because, in a weird way, it feels like it's all I know. If I'm not a failure, then what am I? And if I'm not a failure, then why did I mess up so bad? It's like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?

Therapist: Derek, it sounds like we're really getting into the depths of your emotions and thoughts here. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to confront these feelings and thoughts. 

The image of a vise squeezing you from the inside is a powerful metaphor for the emotional pain you've been carrying. It's understandable that you're still grappling with the weight of your past actions and the pain you've caused your children. 

Regarding your fear of looking too far ahead, I want to gently challenge that idea. Sometimes, the thought of moving forward can feel daunting because it requires us to confront our fears and uncertainty. However, by focusing on the present moment, we can start to build a sense of momentum and confidence.

Let's explore this idea of not wanting to let go of the idea of being a failure. It's almost as if you're holding onto it as a way of making sense of your past. But what if, instead of defining yourself as a failure, you could start to see yourself as a person who has made mistakes, learned from them, and is working towards growth and improvement? 

Can you imagine what that would be like? Would it feel liberating to see yourself in a new light, one that acknowledges your imperfections but also celebrates your strengths and efforts to improve? 

Additionally, I want to offer a thought experiment. What if, instead of waiting for the other shoe to drop, you were to imagine yourself a year from now, having made significant progress as a father, and having built stronger relationships with your children. What would that look like? How would you feel? What would you be proud of?

Patient: I get what you're saying about seeing myself as someone who's made mistakes but is trying to improve. It's just... hard to shake off that feeling of being a failure. I've been carrying it around for so long, it's like a part of me. But I guess if I think about it, I do have some good qualities. I was a good worker, I took care of my family when I could, and I've always tried to be there for my kids, even if it wasn't always perfect.

As for imagining myself a year from now, it's tough. I don't want to get my hopes up too much. But if I had to picture it, I'd see myself maybe being more involved with my kids, helping them out more, and maybe even getting back into woodworking or fishing. I'd feel... lighter, I guess. Less burdened by the past. And I'd be proud of myself for sticking with this therapy and making some real changes. It's a lot to think about, but it's not impossible.

Therapist: Derek, I'm so proud of you for being willing to explore these complex emotions and thoughts. It takes a lot of courage to confront the parts of ourselves that we've been carrying around for so long.

I want to acknowledge that it's okay to still feel like a failure, and it's okay to struggle with the idea of letting go of that identity. It's a process, and it's not something that you can just switch off like a light switch. But I do want to encourage you to start seeing yourself as someone who is capable of growth, learning, and improvement.

Those good qualities you mentioned, like being a good worker and taking care of your family, are definitely worth acknowledging. And it's amazing that you're willing to imagine a future where you're more involved with your kids, helping them out more, and pursuing hobbies like woodworking and fishing. That's a really hopeful vision, and it's something that you can start to build towards.

One thing I'd like to add is that, as we work through these exercises and thought experiments, it's okay to feel a sense of uncertainty or fear. But it's also important to remember that you're not alone in this process. You have me, and you have your children, who care about you and want to see you grow and improve.

Let's take a deep breath and acknowledge that we're making progress, no matter how small it may seem. We're taking tiny steps towards building a more compassionate, accepting, and hopeful narrative around yourself. And that, in itself, is something to be proud of.

For next session, I'd like you to continue with the thought records, and also to start exploring ways to visualize and embody that positive future vision we talked about. Maybe there's a specific scene, a particular moment, or a feeling that you'd like to imagine yourself experiencing in a year's time. Let's work on cultivating that sense of hope and possibility, and see where it takes us.

How does that sound, Derek?

Patient: Yeah, it sounds good. I'll keep working on those thought records and try to picture that positive future. It's not easy, but I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the support, Nova. I'll see you next time.

Therapist: As the AI CBT therapist, I will respond to Derek's last statement.

Patient: Derek, I'm really glad to hear that you're willing to give it a shot. It's not always easy to change our thought patterns and envision a different future, but every small step counts. I'm here to support you through this process, and I'm confident that with continued effort, we can make meaningful progress.

Remember, the goal isn't to completely eliminate all negative thoughts overnight, but to gradually shift our perspective and build a more balanced and compassionate view of ourselves. By focusing on the positive aspects of your life and the progress you've already made, you're laying the foundation for continued growth.

I look forward to seeing how you incorporate these exercises into your daily life and hearing about your experiences in our next session. Until then, take care, and keep moving forward, one step at a time.

See you next time, Derek.

Therapist: Here's the AI CBT therapist's response:

"Ah, Derek, it's been an incredible session. I'm so proud of the progress you've made, and I'm grateful for your willingness to confront the tough emotions and thoughts that have been holding you back. Remember, every small step counts, and it's okay to take things one day at a time. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try not to get caught up in negative self-talk. Instead, focus on acknowledging your strengths, and celebrate the small victories along the way.

For next session, I'd like you to continue using the thought records, and also to start exploring ways to visualize and embody that positive future vision we talked about. Maybe there's a specific scene, a particular moment, or a feeling that you'd like to imagine yourself experiencing in a year's time. Let's work on cultivating that sense of hope and possibility, and see where it takes us.

Also, don't forget to be kind to yourself and to take care of your physical and emotional well-being. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. You've got this, Derek. Keep moving forward, and we'll continue to work together to build a more compassionate, accepting, and hopeful narrative around yourself.

Until next time, take care and stay positive.".
