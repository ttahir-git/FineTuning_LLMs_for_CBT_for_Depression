Therapist: Welcome back to session 20, Naomi! I'm glad to see that you've been actively practicing the strategies we discussed last time, and that you've had some time to reflect on our previous conversations. How have you been feeling about the homework assignments I gave you? Have you started journaling daily, and if so, have you noticed any changes in your mood or stress levels?

Also, I'd love to hear more about how the "DEAR MAN" approach has been going with your parents. Have you had any opportunities to practice it in conversations about your career choices? And what about academic concerns - have you had a chance to speak with any professors or advisors yet?

Patient: I've been trying to journal daily, but I have to admit, some days are harder than others. I've noticed that when I do manage to write consistently, it helps me sort through my thoughts and feel less overwhelmed. My stress levels seem to fluctuate, but I think the journaling is making a difference on the days I stick with it.

As for the "DEAR MAN" approach with my parents, I haven't gotten a chance to use it much yet. Our recent conversations have been pretty tense, especially when they bring up my career choices. I'm still trying to figure out how to approach them without causing more conflict. 

Regarding academic concerns, I did speak with Professor Chen about one of my research projects. She was really understanding and offered some useful advice. I feel a bit more confident about it now, but I'm still struggling to keep up with all my deadlines.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making progress with journaling, Naomi, and that it's helping you feel more grounded on the days you're able to stick with it. That's a great accomplishment! It's also great to hear that you've had a chance to speak with Professor Chen and that she was supportive.

It's understandable that conversations with your parents about your career choices are still feeling tense. Using the "DEAR MAN" approach can take some practice, but it's not always easy to navigate these types of conversations. Let's take some time to review how you can apply the "DEAR MAN" approach in your next conversation with your parents.

When you use the "DEAR MAN" approach, remember to:

* D: Describe the issue or situation clearly
* E: Express your feelings and needs clearly
* A: Assert your needs and wants
* R: Reinforce the importance of your needs and wants
* M: Maintain the conversation and avoid getting sidetracked
* A: Agree on a plan or next steps
* N: Normalize the conversation by acknowledging the other person's perspective

Can you think of a specific scenario or conversation you'd like to prepare for using the "DEAR MAN" approach? What would you like to communicate to your parents about your career choices?

Also, regarding your academic concerns, it's great that you're taking steps to seek help and support from professors. Have you considered setting up a system or planner to help you keep track of your deadlines and responsibilities? We could work on developing a system together to help you stay organized and on top of things.

Patient: I appreciate the reminder about the "DEAR MAN" approach. I think the next time my parents bring up my career choices, I'll try to use it. Specifically, I want to communicate that while I respect their concerns and cultural values, I also need to pursue a path that aligns with my passions and strengths. I want them to understand that I'm not just rebelling but trying to find a balance that works for both of us.

As for academic organization, I've been using a planner, but it's not always enough. I think I need something more structured, maybe even a digital tool that sends reminders. I'm open to any suggestions you might have.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making great progress, Naomi. Let's break down your plan for using the "DEAR MAN" approach with your parents. Can you walk me through how you would like to describe the issue or situation clearly? How would you express your feelings and needs, and what specific needs and wants would you like to assert? 

Also, I love that you're open to exploring digital tools for academic organization. We could brainstorm some options together, such as using a task management app like Todoist or Trello, or setting up reminders on your phone or computer. Have you considered creating a schedule or planner specifically for your academic responsibilities, including dedicated blocks of time for studying and working on projects? 

As we work on this, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to navigate these conversations with your parents, especially when you're trying to balance your own needs with theirs. Remember that it's okay to prioritize your own goals and aspirations, and that seeking support from professors like Professor Chen is a great step towards achieving them. 

One thing to consider is how you can reframe your conversations with your parents to focus on shared values and goals, rather than just trying to convince them of your point of view. For example, what are some common values or interests that you and your parents share? How can you use those shared values to find common ground and build a stronger relationship? 

What are your thoughts on this, Naomi?

Patient: For the "DEAR MAN" approach, I think I would start by describing the situation as my parents wanting me to pursue a career that aligns with their cultural expectations, while I'm feeling pulled towards environmental science, which is my passion. I would express my feelings by saying that I understand their concerns and want to make them proud, but I also need to follow my own path to be happy and fulfilled. My needs and wants would be to find a career that combines my love for the environment with my cultural background, and to have their support in exploring these options.

Regarding digital tools, I've heard of Todoist and Trello, but I haven't used them before. I think a schedule with dedicated blocks of time for studying and project work could really help me stay on track. I'm willing to try anything that might make things easier.

As for reframing conversations with my parents, I think we share a strong value in wanting to help and support our community. I could talk about how my environmental science research can have a positive impact on coastal communities, which is something that resonates with our family's roots in Gujarat. I think finding this common ground could help bridge the gap between our different perspectives.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making great progress, Naomi. Let's summarize our plan for using the "DEAR MAN" approach with your parents.

First, you'll describe the situation clearly by explaining their concerns and your own feelings about pursuing a career in environmental science. Then, you'll express your feelings and needs by saying that you understand their concerns, but you also need to follow your own path to be happy and fulfilled. You'll assert your needs and wants by stating that you'd like to find a career that combines your love for the environment with your cultural background, and that you'd appreciate their support in exploring these options.

Regarding digital tools, we can definitely explore options like Todoist, Trello, or other task management apps that might help you stay organized and on top of your academic responsibilities. We can also brainstorm ways to create a schedule or planner specifically for your academic responsibilities, including dedicated blocks of time for studying and project work.

I'm glad you're thinking about reframing your conversations with your parents around shared values and goals. Using your parents' cultural background in coastal communities as a way to find common ground is a great idea. It's possible that they may be more open to your career choices if they see how they align with your values and goals.

As we move forward, I'd like to work on some role-playing exercises to help you practice using the "DEAR MAN" approach in different scenarios. We can also continue to work on developing a system for managing your academic responsibilities, including creating a schedule and setting up reminders.

Before we end this session, I'd like to check in with you about how you're feeling about our conversation today. Are there any emotions or concerns that are coming up for you that you'd like to talk about?

Patient: I feel a bit anxious about actually having the conversation with my parents, but I think the "DEAR MAN" approach will help me stay focused and clear. I'm also excited to try out some new digital tools for organizing my academic work. It feels like a step in the right direction.

One concern that's been on my mind is whether my parents will ever fully accept my identity as non-binary. They still use feminine pronouns and seem to have a hard time understanding why I've made these changes. I worry that this might affect how they respond to my career choices.

Therapist: It's completely understandable to feel anxious about having conversations with your parents, especially when you're trying to navigate complex issues like identity and career choices. But it's great that you're feeling more confident about using the "DEAR MAN" approach to communicate your needs and wants.

Regarding your concern about your parents accepting your non-binary identity, it's essential to remember that their understanding and acceptance may take time. It's possible that they may be struggling to understand or come to terms with your identity, but that doesn't mean they won't ever accept it.

In our next session, let's work on developing some strategies for having conversations with your parents about your identity, including how to express your needs and feelings in a clear and assertive way. We can also discuss how to deal with potential pushback or resistance from them.

It's also worth noting that your parents' acceptance of your non-binary identity may be related to their own cultural background and values. As we discussed earlier, using shared values and goals to find common ground can be a powerful way to build stronger relationships and navigate challenging conversations.

Before we end this session, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to be yourself, especially when you're navigating complex issues like identity and career choices. You're doing an amazing job, Naomi, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

As we move forward, let's make sure to prioritize your emotional well-being and safety. If you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to cope with emotions related to these conversations, we can work on developing some coping strategies and support systems.

Homework for next session:

1. Continue practicing the "DEAR MAN" approach in conversations with your parents, focusing on finding common ground and shared values.
2. Explore digital tools for managing your academic responsibilities, such as Todoist or Trello, and set up a schedule or planner specifically for your academic work.
3. Brainstorm strategies for having conversations with your parents about your non-binary identity, including how to express your needs and feelings in a clear and assertive way.

Remember, Naomi, you're not alone in this journey. I'm here to support you, and together, we can work towards building stronger relationships and navigating complex challenges.

Patient: Thank you for the support, Nova. I appreciate it. I'll definitely work on the homework assignments and try to practice the "DEAR MAN" approach more with my parents. I'll also explore those digital tools for organizing my academic work.

I'm feeling a bit more hopeful after our conversation today. I'll keep you updated on how things go.

Therapist: I'm glad I could help facilitate a productive conversation with you, Naomi. It sounds like we've made some great progress in exploring the "DEAR MAN" approach and developing strategies for managing your academic responsibilities.

Remember, using the "DEAR MAN" approach is not a one-time fix, but rather a tool that can help you navigate complex conversations with your parents over time. Be patient with yourself and remember to take breaks when you need to.

Regarding your academic organization, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance on setting up digital tools or a schedule. We can work together to find a system that works for you.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to navigate conversations about your non-binary identity with your parents. Remember that your identity is valid and deserving of respect, and it's okay to express your needs and feelings in a clear and assertive way.

Before we wrap up, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling about our conversation today. Are there any final thoughts or emotions that you'd like to share?

Also, don't forget to practice self-care and prioritize your emotional well-being throughout the week. Remember to take breaks, engage in activities that bring you joy, and reach out to me if you need any further support.

Next session, we'll continue to work on developing strategies for navigating conversations about your non-binary identity with your parents and explore further ways to build stronger relationships and manage challenging emotions.

Until then, take care of yourself, Naomi. You're doing great!
