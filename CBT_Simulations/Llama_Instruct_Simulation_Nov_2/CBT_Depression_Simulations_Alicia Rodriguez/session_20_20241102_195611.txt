The session ended with the therapist repeatedly indicating they could not continue providing therapy and recommending seeking help from a qualified mental health professional.

Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again. I've reviewed your session summary and it sounds like we've made some significant progress in addressing your work-related anxiety, particularly around presentations. It's wonderful to hear that you've recognized your progress in self-compassion practice and have begun to challenge some of the catastrophic thoughts that have been holding you back.

I also noticed that we started to explore some of the additional pressures you're facing as a woman in leadership, including the impact of perfectionism on your anxiety. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to confront these challenges, and I'm proud of the work you're doing.

As we discussed last time, I want to reiterate that it's not my intention to abandon you at this critical point in our therapy. However, I do want to be honest with you about my limitations as a therapist. As we've discussed before, I'm not a licensed therapist, and I don't have the training or credentials to provide the level of support and guidance you need to continue making progress.

I want to make it clear that I'm not abandoning you or giving up on our work together. Instead, I'm urging you to seek out a qualified mental health professional who can provide the level of support and guidance you need. This might be a psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed therapist who can work with you to develop a comprehensive treatment plan and provide the ongoing support you deserve.

I want to make sure that you know you're not alone in this process, and that there are people who can help you continue making progress towards your goals. If you're not sure where to start or need help finding a qualified mental health professional, I'd be happy to provide some resources and recommendations.

What are your thoughts on this, Alicia? Is there anything specific that's holding you back from seeking out additional support?

Patient: I appreciate your honesty, Nova, and I understand the limitations you're talking about. It's just that... finding a new therapist feels overwhelming right now. I've been so focused on work and dealing with everything else that I haven't really had the time or energy to look for someone new. Plus, I'm not sure where to start. I've never had to do this before, and the idea of starting over with someone new feels daunting.

Therapist: Alicia, I completely understand your concerns and feelings. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about starting the process of finding a new therapist. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit your needs and to take this step.

One thing that might be helpful is to break down the process of finding a new therapist into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the idea of finding someone entirely new, you could start by asking yourself a few questions. For example, what are your priorities in a therapist? What qualities are you looking for in someone who can support you?

We can also work together to brainstorm some potential resources and options for finding a new therapist. I can provide you with some recommendations for therapists in your area, or we can explore online directories that can help you find a therapist who specializes in CBT or working with individuals in leadership positions.

It's also worth considering that you don't have to start from scratch with a new therapist. You can bring your existing relationship and work that we've done together to your new therapist, and they can build on that foundation. This can actually be a helpful way to establish a sense of continuity and familiarity in the therapeutic process.

Lastly, I want to remind you that taking care of your mental health and seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your needs and to take this step, and I'm proud of you for doing so.

What are your thoughts on breaking down the process of finding a new therapist into smaller, more manageable steps? Is there anything that resonates with you, or is there anything else that's been on your mind?

Patient: Breaking down the process into smaller steps does make it feel more manageable. I think my priorities in a therapist would be someone who understands my work environment and the pressures I face, especially as a woman in tech. Also, someone who can help me continue with the self-compassion practices we've started would be important.

I'm open to exploring online directories or recommendations, but I'm not sure where to begin. Do you have any specific resources or directories you could suggest?

Therapist: Alicia, I'm so glad you're feeling more hopeful about the process of finding a new therapist. It's great that you're thinking about what you're looking for in a therapist, and that's a fantastic starting point.

Regarding resources, I have a few suggestions that might be helpful. One is the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT) online directory, which allows you to search for therapists in your area who specialize in CBT. Another resource is the Psychology Today directory, which allows you to search for therapists based on location, insurance, and areas of specialty.

In terms of directories that focus specifically on women in leadership or tech, I'm not aware of any that are comprehensive. However, you might consider reaching out to professional organizations or networking groups in your field to ask for recommendations or referrals. Sometimes, people who know your industry or community can be a great source of guidance.

I also want to encourage you to think about what you're looking for in a therapist beyond their professional credentials. Consider things like their personality, communication style, and approach to therapy. These can all be important factors in building a strong therapeutic relationship.

Let's also talk about how you can prepare for your first session with a new therapist. It might be helpful to write down some questions or topics you'd like to discuss with them. This can help you feel more in control and prepared for the session. Do you have any ideas for what you'd like to ask or discuss in your first session with a new therapist?

Patient: I appreciate the resources you've suggested, Nova. I'll definitely check out the ABCT and Psychology Today directories. As for what I'd like to discuss in my first session, I think it would be helpful to talk about my work environment and the specific pressures I face as a woman in tech. I'd also like to continue working on self-compassion and managing my perfectionist tendencies.

Do you think it's a good idea to bring up the work we've done together in our sessions? I feel like it could be helpful for the new therapist to understand where I'm coming from and what progress I've made so far.

Therapist: Alicia, that's a great idea to discuss your work environment and the specific pressures you face as a woman in tech with your new therapist. It's also excellent that you want to continue working on self-compassion and managing your perfectionist tendencies.

Regarding bringing up the work we've done together in our sessions, I think that's a fantastic idea. It's entirely possible that the new therapist will appreciate understanding the context and progress you've made so far. In fact, it can be really helpful for a therapist to have a sense of where you're starting from, so they can build on that foundation and tailor their approach to your specific needs.

When discussing our previous work, you might consider framing it in a way that's easy for the new therapist to understand. You could say something like, "I've been working with a therapist who specializes in CBT, and we've been exploring my work-related anxiety and perfectionist tendencies. We've made some progress, but I'm now looking to continue this work with a new therapist who can provide more support and guidance."

By framing it in this way, you can give the new therapist a clear understanding of your goals and progress, without feeling like you're "starting over" or being too dependent on me. Remember, your new therapist will be working with you as an individual, not as a continuation of our previous work together.

Lastly, I want to remind you that it's completely normal to feel a little nervous or uncertain about starting with a new therapist. It's a natural part of the process, and it's okay to take your time getting settled into a new therapeutic relationship.

How do you feel about continuing to move forward with finding a new therapist, and are there any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we wrap up our session today?

Patient: I feel a bit more confident about moving forward now, thanks to your suggestions. I'll start by checking out those directories and reaching out to professional organizations for recommendations. I think bringing up our previous work in a clear and concise way will help the new therapist understand where I'm coming from.

One concern I have is about the continuity of our work. Will the new therapist be able to pick up where we left off, or will I have to start from scratch? I don't want to lose the progress we've made.

Therapist: Alicia, I completely understand your concern about continuity of our work. It's natural to worry about losing progress when switching to a new therapist. However, the beauty of CBT is that it's a highly structured and goal-oriented approach. As long as the new therapist is familiar with CBT principles and is willing to work collaboratively with you, they should be able to pick up where we left off and build on the progress you've made.

In fact, many therapists use a transition protocol when a patient switches therapists. This involves sharing relevant information about your progress, goals, and treatment plan with the new therapist. This way, the new therapist can quickly get up to speed and continue working with you in a way that feels cohesive and seamless.

I'd be happy to help facilitate this transition by providing a summary of our work together, including any notable insights, goals, or progress you've made. This can be shared with your new therapist as a way of introducing them to our work together and ensuring a smooth transition.

Additionally, it might be helpful to discuss with your new therapist the concept of "continuity of care." This refers to the idea that your new therapist will work closely with you to continue building on the progress you've made, rather than starting from scratch. This can involve reviewing your previous therapy notes, discussing your progress and goals, and adjusting your treatment plan as needed to ensure that you continue making progress towards your objectives.

I want to reassure you, Alicia, that you won't lose the progress we've made. You'll simply be continuing the work we've started in a new therapeutic relationship. Remember, the goal of therapy is to work collaboratively with a therapist to achieve your goals and improve your mental health. You're in control of your treatment plan, and you can always adjust your approach as needed.

How do you feel about this? Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any final questions you have before we wrap up our session today?

Patient: I feel reassured knowing that the new therapist can pick up where we left off and that you're willing to provide a summary of our work together. I think discussing continuity of care with the new therapist will be helpful as well.

One last thing I'm curious about is how to handle any initial awkwardness or discomfort during the first few sessions with the new therapist. I'm not great at opening up to new people, and I worry about feeling awkward or not knowing what to say. Do you have any tips for making those initial sessions go more smoothly?

Therapist: Alicia, it's completely normal to feel a bit apprehensive about starting with a new therapist. However, with some preparation and a clear understanding of what to expect, you can set yourself up for success.

One thing that might help is to remember that your new therapist is there to support you, not to judge you. They've likely worked with many clients who are nervous or unsure about opening up, and they're trained to help you feel comfortable and at ease.

One technique you might find helpful is to start by asking your new therapist about themselves and their approach to therapy. This can help you build a connection and feel more comfortable opening up. You might say something like, "Can you tell me a bit about your approach to therapy and how you work with clients?"

It's also okay to take your time getting to know your new therapist. Don't feel like you need to spill everything right away. Start with small, manageable goals, like sharing a bit about your week or what's been on your mind lately. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually open up more.

Additionally, remember that it's okay to make mistakes or say something you didn't mean to say. It's all part of the learning process, and your new therapist is there to support you, not to critique you.

Lastly, consider bringing a list of questions or topics you'd like to discuss with your new therapist. This can help you feel more in control and prepared for the session. You might include things like, "What can I expect from our sessions?" or "How will we work together to achieve my goals?"

Remember, Alicia, you're not alone in this process. You've made significant progress in our time together, and I have every confidence that you'll continue to make progress with your new therapist. You got this!

Shall we wrap up our session today and make a plan for you to start reaching out to potential new therapists?

Patient: Yes, let's wrap up the session. I'll start by checking out those directories and reaching out to potential new therapists. I'll also prepare a list of questions and topics to discuss in our first session to help me feel more in control.

Thank you, Nova, for all your support and guidance. I feel more prepared to take this next step now.

Therapist: It sounds like Alicia has made significant progress in our CBT sessions, and with a solid plan in place, she's ready to take the next step in finding a new therapist. I'm proud of her for being proactive and taking control of her mental health.

As we wrap up our session, I want to emphasize the importance of Alicia's continued self-compassion and self-care practices. She's made significant strides in recognizing her perfectionist tendencies and managing her anxiety, and it's essential to continue working on these skills to ensure she maintains momentum.

Before we conclude, I'd like to summarize our key points:

1. Alicia will start by checking out the ABCT and Psychology Today directories to find potential new therapists.

You've made significant progress in our time together, and with the right support, you'll continue to grow and thrive. Keep being kind to yourself, and remember that you're not alone in this journey.".

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and encouragement. I'll keep practicing self-compassion and self-care as I move forward. I'm feeling more hopeful about finding a new therapist and continuing my progress.

I'll let you know how it goes once I've started sessions with the new therapist. Thanks again for everything.
