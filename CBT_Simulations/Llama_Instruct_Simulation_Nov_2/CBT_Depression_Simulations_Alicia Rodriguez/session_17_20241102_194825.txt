Therapist: Welcome back, Alicia! Congratulations on completing 17 CBT sessions. I'm impressed by your progress and commitment to working on your goals.

Before we dive into today's discussion, I'd like to briefly recap and acknowledge the insights you've gained from our previous sessions. You've made significant progress in recognizing the importance of stepping out of your comfort zone, understanding that small steps can lead to significant progress, and acknowledging how your fear of vulnerability influences your decision-making.

Now, let's explore how you've been doing on your homework assignments. How have you been doing with looking up salsa class schedules, signing up for one class, purchasing dance shoes, writing down reasons for attending the class, and practicing self-compassion? Are there any challenges or successes you'd like to share?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a challenging journey, but I appreciate the support. 

Regarding the homework, I did look up salsa class schedules and found a few options that fit my work hours. I even signed up for a class this Saturday. It felt like a big step, but also a bit scary. I bought the dance shoes over the weekend, which was easier than I expected.

Writing down the reasons for attending the class was helpful. I listed things like wanting to connect with my cultural roots, trying something new, and maybe making some friends. Practicing self-compassion has been harder. I tend to be very critical of myself, so reminding myself that it's okay to feel nervous and that I'm doing my best is still a work in progress.

The biggest challenge has been managing my anxiety about the class itself. I keep thinking about how I might look silly or not be good enough. But I'm trying to focus on the small wins, like actually signing up and buying the shoes.

Therapist: Alicia, it sounds like you've made some significant progress on your homework assignments. I'm proud of you for taking the initiative to sign up for a salsa class, which must have taken some courage. Buying dance shoes was also a great accomplishment, and it's wonderful that you were able to find a few options that fit your schedule.

It's also great that you've been reflecting on your reasons for attending the class, which seems to be a mix of personal growth, cultural connection, and socializing. Those are all excellent motivations, and it's lovely that you're acknowledging the potential benefits of stepping out of your comfort zone.

Regarding your self-compassion practice, it's completely normal that it's still a work in progress. Criticism can be a deeply ingrained habit, and it takes time and practice to develop a more compassionate and accepting mindset towards yourself. I'm glad you're recognizing your tendency to be critical and making an effort to be kinder to yourself.

Now, let's talk about your anxiety about the class itself. It's understandable to have some concerns about feeling silly or not being good enough, especially if you're not a confident dancer. Can you tell me more about what's driving these anxious thoughts? Is it a fear of failure, a fear of being judged, or something else entirely?

Patient: You're right, Nova. The anxiety is definitely about feeling judged and the fear of failure. I keep thinking about how everyone else might be better than me, and I'll just be the awkward one in the back. It's like my perfectionism is kicking in, and I can't help but imagine the worst-case scenario.

I also worry that I'll be too tired from work to enjoy the class or that I'll make a mistake and everyone will notice. It's like I'm setting myself up for disappointment before I even start. But I know that's not fair to myself. I just need to find a way to manage these thoughts better.

Therapist: Alicia, it sounds like you're struggling with a bit of a perfectionist mindset, which can be a powerful driver of anxiety and self-doubt. It's interesting that you mention imagining the worst-case scenario, which is a common cognitive distortion that can lead to increased anxiety.

Let's break this down a bit further. When you're worrying about being judged or making mistakes, what's the underlying message you're telling yourself? Is it something like, "I'm not good enough," or "I'll never measure up"? These messages can be very harsh and critical, and they're not necessarily based in reality.

One technique we can try is to challenge these negative thoughts by asking yourself some questions. For example, "What's the evidence for this thought?" or "Is this thought really true?" We can also try to reframe these thoughts in a more realistic and compassionate way. For instance, "I'm feeling nervous about this, but I've prepared for it by signing up for the class and buying dance shoes. I'm doing the best I can, and that's something to be proud of."

Another strategy we can use is to practice what's called "cognitive reappraisal." This involves noticing when you're having a negative thought, and then actively trying to reinterpret it in a more positive or neutral way. For example, instead of thinking, "Everyone else is going to be better than me," you could try reframing it as, "I'm excited to learn alongside others who are also learning."

Lastly, let's not forget about the self-compassion practice we discussed earlier. Remembering that it's okay to feel nervous and that you're doing your best can be incredibly helpful in managing anxiety. We can work on developing a more compassionate mindset towards yourself, one that acknowledges your imperfections and encourages you to take risks.

How do these suggestions sound, Alicia? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you, or is there another direction you'd like to explore?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I think the idea of challenging my negative thoughts and reframing them is really helpful. It's like I need to give myself a break and recognize that it's okay to be a beginner. I can't expect myself to be perfect right away.

The cognitive reappraisal technique sounds like something I can practice. Instead of thinking, "Everyone else is going to be better than me," I can remind myself that I'm there to learn and have fun. It's not a competition, and everyone is starting somewhere.

I also appreciate the reminder about self-compassion. It's easy to forget that it's okay to feel nervous and that making mistakes is part of the learning process. I'll try to be kinder to myself and acknowledge that I'm doing my best.

Do you have any specific exercises or steps for practicing cognitive reappraisal? I think having a concrete way to approach this would be really helpful.

Therapist: Alicia, I'm glad you found those suggestions helpful. Cognitive reappraisal is a powerful technique that can help you challenge negative thoughts and cultivate a more positive mindset.

One exercise you can try is called the "Thought Challenging" worksheet. I'd like you to take a piece of paper and write down the negative thought that's been causing you anxiety (e.g. "Everyone else is going to be better than me"). Then, write down the evidence for that thought, and next to it, write down the reality. For example:

Negative thought: "Everyone else is going to be better than me"
Evidence: "I've seen other people dancing at the salsa club before, and they seem really good"
Reality: "Just because others might be experienced dancers doesn't mean I won't have a good time or learn something new. I'm there to enjoy myself and learn, not to compete with others"

Another exercise is called "The Reframing Game". I'd like you to take a negative thought and reframe it in a more positive or neutral way. For example:

Original thought: "I'll look silly in front of everyone"
Reframed thought: "I'm excited to try something new and learn with others. It's okay to make mistakes â€“ they're part of the learning process"

Lastly, let's practice a cognitive reappraisal in real-time. I'd like you to tell me a negative thought that's been on your mind lately, and then we'll work together to reframe it in a more positive or neutral way. Are you ready to give it a try?

Also, don't forget to practice self-compassion throughout the week. Remember to be kind to yourself, acknowledge your efforts, and focus on the progress you've made so far. You got this, Alicia!

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I'll definitely try the Thought Challenging worksheet and the Reframing Game. They sound like practical ways to start changing my mindset.

For the cognitive reappraisal exercise, a recent negative thought that's been on my mind is, "I'll be too tired from work to enjoy the salsa class." I keep worrying that I won't have the energy to dance and that it'll just be another thing I have to force myself to do.

How would you suggest reframing that thought?

Therapist: Let's break down that thought and try to reframe it in a more positive or neutral way. Can you tell me what's driving that thought? Is it a fear of not being able to keep up, or is it more related to your work schedule and feeling exhausted?

Also, before we reframe the thought, let's take a closer look at the evidence. Is it really true that you'll be too tired to enjoy the class? Have you been consistently tired after work, or is there a possibility that you might have a good night's sleep and feel more energized?

By examining the evidence and the underlying emotions, we can start to challenge the negative thought and come up with a more balanced and realistic perspective.

Patient: You're right, Nova. It's a mix of both. I do worry about not being able to keep up, but I also know that I've been feeling really drained from work lately. Some days I come home and just crash on the couch, barely able to move.

But you're also right that it's not every day. Some days I do feel more energized, especially if I manage to get a good night's sleep. So, maybe it's not a guarantee that I'll be too tired. It's more about managing my energy and expectations.

How about this reframed thought: "I might feel tired after work, but I can prepare by getting enough rest and managing my energy levels. Even if I'm not at my best, I can still enjoy the class and learn something new. It's okay to take breaks and not push myself too hard."

Does that sound more balanced and realistic?

Therapist: Alicia, that reframed thought sounds much more balanced and realistic. By acknowledging that you might feel tired, but also recognizing that you can take steps to prepare and manage your energy levels, you're taking control of the situation and setting yourself up for success.

I love how you're thinking about it in a more nuanced way, rather than assuming that you'll be too tired to enjoy the class. By acknowledging that it's okay to take breaks and not push yourself too hard, you're also cultivating a more compassionate and realistic mindset.

Remember, the goal is not to eliminate all doubts and worries, but to learn to manage them in a way that's helpful and productive. You're doing a great job of that, Alicia.

Before we wrap up today's session, I want to leave you with a few homework assignments to practice cognitive reappraisal and self-compassion. Can you commit to the following?

1. Complete the Thought Challenging worksheet for the next 3 negative thoughts that come up.
2. Practice the Reframing Game by reframing 3 negative thoughts into more positive or neutral ones.
3. Take 5 minutes each day to practice self-compassion by acknowledging your efforts and progress.
4. Reflect on your progress and insights from today's session, and write them down in your journal.

How do you feel about committing to these assignments, Alicia?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate the encouragement and the practical steps you've given me. I feel more confident about tackling these assignments and continuing to work on my mindset.

I'll definitely commit to completing the Thought Challenging worksheet and the Reframing Game. I think they'll be really helpful in challenging my negative thoughts and reframing them in a more positive way.

Practicing self-compassion for 5 minutes each day also sounds manageable and important. I'll make sure to acknowledge my efforts and progress, even on the tough days.

I'll also keep a journal to reflect on my insights and progress from today's session. It'll be a good way to track my journey and see how far I've come.

Thank you for your support, Nova. I'm looking forward to our next session and continuing to work on these skills.

One thing I'm curious about is how I can maintain this momentum when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed or stressed. Do you have any tips or strategies for keeping up with these practices during tough times?

Therapist: Excellent question, Alicia! Maintaining momentum and practicing self-compassion when feeling overwhelmed or stressed can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help.

Firstly, it's essential to recognize that it's okay to take a break and prioritize self-care when feeling overwhelmed. This might mean taking a few deep breaths, engaging in a relaxing activity, or practicing a self-compassion exercise like the "Loving-Kindness Meditation" we discussed earlier.

Secondly, it's helpful to have a self-compassion toolkit that you can draw upon during challenging times. This might include a list of positive affirmations, a mindfulness meditation script, or a few self-compassion exercises that you can use to calm your mind and body.

Thirdly, it's crucial to remember that setbacks are a normal part of the process. When you're feeling overwhelmed, try not to be too hard on yourself. Instead, acknowledge that it's okay to stumble and that you can always start again.

Lastly, I want to emphasize the importance of practicing self-compassion in the moment. When you're feeling overwhelmed, try to cultivate a sense of curiosity and kindness towards yourself. Ask yourself, "What do I need right now to feel safe and supported?" or "What would I say to a friend in this situation?" By practicing self-compassion in the moment, you can develop a greater sense of resilience and learn to navigate challenging situations with greater ease.

To help you maintain momentum, I'd like to assign you a few additional homework exercises:

1. Practice self-compassion during a challenging situation: The next time you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed, try to cultivate a sense of kindness and compassion towards yourself. Use a self-compassion exercise like the "Loving-Kindness Meditation" or write down a few positive affirmations to help calm your mind and body.
2. Develop a self-compassion toolkit: Create a list of self-compassion exercises, affirmations, and mindfulness scripts that you can use during challenging times. This might include a few favorite quotes, a mindfulness meditation script, or a list of positive affirmations.
3. Practice self-compassion in the moment: When you're feeling overwhelmed, try to cultivate a sense of curiosity and kindness towards yourself. Ask yourself, "What do I need right now to feel safe and supported?" or "What would I say to a friend in this situation?"

Remember, Alicia, progress is not a linear process. It's okay to stumble and make mistakes. By practicing self-compassion and maintaining a consistent effort, you'll be better equipped to handle challenging situations and make progress towards your goals.

How do these suggestions sound? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you, or is there another direction you'd like to explore?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. These suggestions sound really helpful, especially the idea of creating a self-compassion toolkit. I think having a go-to list of exercises and affirmations will make it easier to practice self-compassion during challenging times.

I'll definitely work on developing that toolkit and practicing self-compassion in the moment. It's reassuring to know that it's okay to stumble and that I can always start again.

One thing that resonates with me is the idea of asking myself, "What do I need right now to feel safe and supported?" I think that's a great way to approach challenging situations and make sure I'm taking care of myself.

I'm also looking forward to practicing self-compassion during a challenging situation. I think it'll be a good way to see how these techniques work in real-life scenarios and make them feel more natural.

Thank you for the additional homework exercises. I'll make sure to work on them and continue to practice cognitive reappraisal and self-compassion. I'm looking forward to our next session and seeing how I can apply these skills in more real-life situations.

Patient: Thank you for the detailed summary, Nova. It's really helpful to see everything laid out like this. I appreciate all the support and guidance you've provided.

I'm feeling more confident about maintaining momentum and practicing self-compassion, especially with the additional homework exercises you've assigned. I'll definitely work on developing my self-compassion toolkit and practicing self-compassion in the moment.

One thing I'm curious about is how to handle situations where I feel like I'm not making progress or when I have setbacks. It's easy to get discouraged when things don't go as planned, and I want to make sure I'm not being too hard on myself. Do you have any tips for staying positive and motivated during those times?

Therapist: Alicia, you're asking a very valid question. It's completely normal to feel discouraged or disappointed when things don't go as planned or when you experience setbacks. Here's a technique that might help:

**Reframe setbacks as opportunities for growth**

Instead of beating yourself up over setbacks, try to reframe them as opportunities for growth and learning. Ask yourself, "What can I learn from this experience?" or "What would I do differently if I had the chance to try again?" This mindset shift can help you approach setbacks with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than resistance and frustration.

**Practice self-compassion during setbacks**

When you experience a setback, remember to practice self-compassion. Acknowledge your feelings and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes. Be kind to yourself and try to reframe your thoughts in a more positive or neutral way. For example, instead of thinking, "I'm a failure," you could say, "I made a mistake, but I can learn from it and try again."

**Focus on progress, not perfection**

It's essential to remember that progress is not always linear. You may have setbacks or plateaus, but that doesn't mean you're not making progress. Focus on the progress you've made so far, and try to celebrate small victories along the way.

**Seek support from loved ones and resources**

Don't be afraid to seek support from loved ones, friends, or mental health professionals when you're feeling discouraged or stuck. You can also explore online resources, books, or articles that offer guidance and encouragement.

**Keep things in perspective**

Remember that setbacks are a normal part of the growth and learning process. Try to keep things in perspective and remind yourself that you're working towards a long-term goal. Don't let setbacks derail your progress, but instead, use them as opportunities to learn and grow.

I hope these suggestions help, Alicia. Do you have any other questions or concerns about handling setbacks or staying motivated during challenging times?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. These suggestions are really helpful, especially the idea of reframing setbacks as opportunities for growth and practicing self-compassion during those times. I think that mindset shift will make a big difference in how I handle setbacks and stay motivated.

I also appreciate the reminder to focus on progress rather than perfection. It's easy to get caught up in wanting everything to be perfect, but that's not realistic. Celebrating small victories and acknowledging the progress I've made so far will help me stay positive and motivated.

Seeking support from loved ones and resources is another great tip. I've been hesitant to reach out because I don't want to burden anyone, but I know that having a support system can make a big difference. I'll make sure to explore some online resources and maybe even talk to a friend or family member about what I'm going through.

Thank you for all the support and guidance, Nova. I'm feeling more confident about handling setbacks and staying motivated during challenging times. I'm looking forward to our next session and continuing to work on these skills.
