Therapist: Thank you for coming in today, Alicia. It's great to see you again. Before we dive into today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made so far. You've been actively working on reframing "good enough," processing your grief, and developing self-compassion. That takes a lot of courage and commitment.

Can you tell me how you've been feeling since our last session? Have you noticed any changes in your thoughts, emotions, or behaviors?

Also, I'd like to review the homework you were assigned last time. Have you been sticking to your journaling, tracking perfectionist thinking, and practicing self-compassion exercises daily? Are there any challenges you're facing in implementing these new habits?

Lastly, I'd love to hear about any insights or realizations you've had since our last session. Are there any new perspectives or understandings that you've gained about yourself or your struggles with perfectionism and grief?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's good to be here.

Since our last session, I've been feeling a bit more stable, but still pretty overwhelmed. I've noticed that I'm catching myself more often when I start to spiral into perfectionist thinking. For example, last week, I was reviewing some code and instead of tearing it apart, I reminded myself that "good enough" is okay. It felt weird at first, but also kind of liberating.

I've been trying to stick to the journaling and self-compassion exercises, but it's been tough. Some days, I just don't feel like doing it, and I end up working late instead. I know that's not the best way to cope, but it's what I'm used to.

One insight I've had is that my perfectionism isn't just about doing things perfectly—it's also about avoiding failure and the disappointment that comes with it. I realized that if I don't try to be perfect, I might fail, and that scares me. But I'm starting to see that failure isn't the end of the world, and it's actually a part of learning and growing.

I've also been thinking a lot about my grandmother and how she would want me to live my life. She always encouraged me to be strong and independent, but she also knew when to ask

Therapist: Alicia, it sounds like you've made some great progress in recognizing your perfectionist thinking and starting to challenge it. That takes a lot of awareness and courage, so kudos to you!

It's also great to hear that you're feeling a bit more stable, but still acknowledging that you're not feeling 100% yet. That's totally okay. It's a process, and we're taking it one step at a time.

I love that you mentioned the insight about avoiding failure and the disappointment that comes with it. That's a really key piece of the puzzle. It sounds like you're starting to understand that perfectionism is not just about doing things perfectly, but also about protecting yourself from potential pain. That's a really vulnerable and honest place to be.

Regarding the homework, it's understandable that you've been struggling to stick to the journaling and self-compassion exercises some days. That's actually a great opportunity to practice self-compassion and acknowledge that it's okay to have off days. Perhaps we can explore some strategies to help you make self-care and self-compassion more of a habit.

I'd also love to hear more about your thoughts on failure and how that's related to your grandmother's influence. Can you tell me more about what you're thinking about when you consider asking for help or making a mistake? Is there a fear of disappointing her, or something else that's at play?

Let's dive deeper into that and see if we can uncover any more insights and patterns.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the encouragement.

When I think about failure, it's not just about disappointing my grandmother, but also about letting myself down. I've always been the one who could handle everything on my own, and admitting that I can't do it all is really hard. It feels like a weakness.

As for asking for help, it's like I'm afraid that if I show any vulnerability, people will see that I'm not as strong as they think I am. I know that's not rational, but it's how I feel. I guess I'm worried that if I ask for help, it will confirm my imposter syndrome and make me feel even more like a fraud.

I've been trying to remind myself that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. But old habits die hard, and it's still really tough to put that into practice.

I've also been thinking about how my grandmother would handle situations where she felt overwhelmed. She was always so resilient and resourceful. I want to honor her memory by being the same way, but I also need to remember that it's okay to take care of myself and ask for help when I need it.

It's a delicate balance, and I'm still figuring it out.

Therapist: Alicia, it's wonderful that you're recognizing the link between your perfectionism, fear of failure, and imposter syndrome. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge these vulnerabilities, and I'm proud of you for being so honest with yourself.

It sounds like you're struggling with the idea that asking for help would make you appear weak or vulnerable to others. This is a common fear, but it's also a misconception. As we've discussed before, asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes courage to admit when we need support, and it's a necessary part of growth and learning.

I love that you're trying to remind yourself of this, and it's great that you're thinking about how your grandmother would handle similar situations. It's beautiful that you want to honor her memory by being resilient and resourceful. However, it's also essential to remember that you're not your grandmother, and you have your own unique strengths and challenges.

Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about what you think others would think of you if you asked for help? Is there a specific fear or expectation that's driving this concern? And what would it mean for you to ask for help and receive it? How might that change your perception of yourself and your abilities?

Additionally, let's talk about self-compassion and how you can practice it in a way that feels more natural to you. We can brainstorm some ideas for making self-care and self-compassion more of a habit, so it's not just something you do when you feel like it.

Lastly, I want to gently challenge the idea that asking for help would confirm your imposter syndrome. While it's possible that others might view you as less capable, it's also possible that they would see you as brave and willing to learn. What if asking for help was seen as a sign of growth and determination, rather than a weakness? How might that shift your perspective and behavior?

Patient: When I think about what others might think if I asked for help, I imagine them seeing me as less competent or less capable. I worry that they'll think I'm not cut out for my role as a team lead, especially since I'm one of the few women in a leadership position. It feels like a big risk to show any vulnerability.

If I were to ask for help and receive it, it would mean acknowledging that I don't have to do everything on my own. It would be a step towards trusting others and building stronger relationships. But it's hard to let go of the fear that asking for help would make me seem less competent.

As for self-compassion, I'm still trying to figure out how to make it feel more natural. I think part of the problem is that I'm so used to pushing myself hard that being kind to myself feels foreign. Maybe if I could find a way to integrate self-compassion into my daily routine, like setting aside a specific time each day to practice it, it might become more habitual.

I understand what you're saying about asking for help being seen as a sign of growth and determination. It's a perspective shift that I'm working on. I guess I need to remind myself that everyone needs help at some point, and it's okay to be one of those people.

I'm still grappling with these ideas, but

Therapist: Alicia, it sounds like you're still grappling with the fear of being seen as less competent or capable by others, especially in a leadership role. This is a common concern, but it's essential to remember that vulnerability and asking for help are not signs of weakness, but rather signs of strength and courage.

Let's explore this further. Can you think of a specific situation where you might be able to ask for help without feeling like it would compromise your competence or leadership role? Perhaps it's a situation where you can ask for help from someone you trust, like a colleague or a mentor. How might you approach that situation, and what language might you use to ask for help?

Regarding self-compassion, I love the idea of setting aside a specific time each day to practice it. We can brainstorm some ideas for self-compassion exercises that might feel more natural to you, such as writing yourself a kind letter, practicing mindfulness, or engaging in a relaxing activity. The goal is to find ways to cultivate self-compassion that feel enjoyable and sustainable for you.

Remember, self-compassion is not just about being kind to yourself when you're feeling good; it's also about being kind to yourself when you're feeling struggling or uncertain. By practicing self-compassion, you can develop a more positive and accepting relationship with yourself, even in the midst of challenges.

Let's also talk about reframing your thinking around failure and asking for help. Can you think of a specific situation where you might be able to ask for help and view it as a sign of growth and determination, rather than weakness? Perhaps it's a situation where you can reframe your thinking around failure as an opportunity for learning and growth, rather than a source of shame or embarrassment.

Lastly, I want to encourage you to continue to practice self-compassion and to be kind to yourself as you work through these challenges. Remember that you're not alone, and that it's okay to take things at your own pace. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

Let's set a goal for the next session to practice asking for help in a specific situation, and to continue to work on reframing your thinking around failure and vulnerability. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I appreciate the encouragement.

For the specific situation where I might ask for help, I think I could approach one of my colleagues who's really good at project management. I've been struggling with balancing all the tasks as a team lead, and I know she has a lot of experience in that area. I could ask her for advice on how to better manage my time and prioritize tasks.

As for self-compassion exercises, I think writing myself a kind letter could be a good start. I've never done that before, but it sounds like it could help me be more gentle with myself. Maybe I could also try some mindfulness exercises, like focusing on my breath for a few minutes each day.

I'll work on reframing my thinking around failure and asking for help. I know it's not easy, but I'm willing to give it a try. I'll think of a specific situation where I can practice asking for help and view it as a sign of growth.

Thanks for the support, Nova. I'll see you in the next session.

Patient: ### Session 10: Beyond Perfection

**Alicia:**
Nova, I appreciate your words, but honestly, I still feel a bit lost. The idea of asking for help is so foreign to me, even after all these sessions. It’s like I’m trying to break a habit that’s been ingrained in me since I was a kid. My parents always told me to be strong, to never show weakness, and to always succeed. So, when you talk about asking for help being a sign of strength, it just feels... counterintuitive.

And the self-compassion exercises, like writing a kind letter to myself? I’ve tried it, but it feels so forced. I end up criticizing myself in the letter instead of being kind. It’s like I can’t turn off that critical voice in my head no matter how hard I try.

I’ve been thinking about what you said about my grandmother. She was always so resilient, but she also knew when to lean on others. I guess I’m struggling with the balance between being strong and being vulnerable. It’s almost like I’m afraid that if I ask for help, I’ll lose that part of me that’s supposed to be so strong. Does that make sense?

**Nova:**
Alicia, your honesty is incredibly valuable, and it’s perfectly understandable that these concepts feel counterintuitive or

Therapist: **Nova:**
Alicia, your honesty is incredibly valuable, and it’s perfectly understandable that these concepts feel counterintuitive or difficult to implement, especially when they go against deeply ingrained habits and expectations.

Let’s break down this feeling of being lost and struggling with the idea of asking for help. Can you tell me more about what it means to be “strong” to you? What does that look like, and how does it feel when you embody that strength? Perhaps we can explore some scenarios where you might feel like you’re compromising that strength by asking for help.

Regarding the self-compassion exercises, it’s not uncommon for the critical voice to surface initially. However, with practice, you can learn to be kinder and more compassionate towards yourself. I want to encourage you to keep experimenting with these exercises and see what works best for you. Maybe we can try a different approach or explore other self-compassion strategies that might feel more natural.

As for the balance between being strong and vulnerable, it’s a great point. Recognizing that vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness, can be a powerful shift in perspective. Let’s work on reframing this idea and exploring ways to integrate vulnerability into your daily life, so you can feel more confident and authentic in your relationships and decision-making.

To start, I’d like to assign some homework for you to practice asking for help in a low-stakes situation. Perhaps it’s asking a colleague for advice on a project or seeking feedback from a friend on a creative project. The goal is to build your confidence and comfort level with asking for help, so you can start to see it as a sign of strength rather than weakness.

Additionally, I want to encourage you to keep exploring self-compassion exercises and find what works best for you. We can brainstorm more ideas and strategies in our next session.

Lastly, let’s schedule a check-in for our next session to review your progress, discuss any challenges, and continue to work on reframing your thoughts around perfectionism and vulnerability.

How does this sound, Alicia?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I appreciate the support and the practical steps you're suggesting.

When I think about what being "strong" means to me, it's usually about being independent, capable, and always finding a way to solve problems on my own. It feels like a shield that protects me from feeling inadequate or vulnerable. But at the same time, it also feels exhausting because it means I never let myself rely on others.

For the homework, I can try asking a colleague for advice on a project. I think it would be easier to start with something work-related since I’m more comfortable in that environment. Maybe I can ask for feedback on a new coding project I’m working on. It’s a low-stakes situation, and it would be a good way to practice asking for help without feeling like I’m compromising my strength.

As for the self-compassion exercises, I’ll keep experimenting with different approaches. Maybe I can try a guided meditation or a mindfulness app to see if that feels more natural. I’ll also keep writing those kind letters, even if they feel forced at first.

I’m looking forward to our next session and seeing how these exercises can help me continue to grow. Thanks for the guidance, Nova.

Therapist: It sounds like Alicia has made some progress in recognizing her perfectionism and imposter syndrome, but is still struggling with the idea of asking for help and being vulnerable. She feels like she's losing her sense of strength and independence if she asks for help, and is having trouble implementing self-compassion exercises due to her critical inner voice.

Some possible CBT strategies to address these issues could be:

1. **Cognitive restructuring:** Help Alicia to challenge her negative thoughts and reframe her perceptions of asking for help as a sign of strength, rather than weakness.
2. **Behavioral experiments:** Encourage Alicia to practice asking for help in low-stakes situations, such as asking a colleague for advice, to build her confidence and comfort level with vulnerability.
3. **Self-compassion skills training:** Help Alicia to develop self-compassion skills through exercises such as writing kind letters, practicing mindfulness, or using a guided meditation.
4. **Values-based action:** Help Alicia to identify her core values and connect them to her behavior, such as valuing independence and self-reliance, but also valuing growth, learning, and building strong relationships.

Some possible questions to explore in the next session could be:

* What are some specific situations where Alicia feels like she's compromising her strength by asking for help?
* How can Alicia reframe her thoughts around vulnerability and asking for help as a sign of strength, rather than weakness?
* What are some low-stakes situations where Alicia can practice asking for help, such as asking a colleague for advice or seeking feedback on a project?
* How can Alicia develop self-compassion skills to counteract her critical inner voice and build a more positive and accepting relationship with herself?

Patient: ### Session 11: Embracing Vulnerability

**Alicia:**
Nova, I’ve been thinking about what you said last time about reframing asking for help as a sign of strength. It’s still a bit of a struggle, but I’m trying to see it differently. I think part of the problem is that I’m so used to being the one who solves problems that it feels strange to ask for help. It’s like I’m admitting that I can’t do it all on my own, which is hard to accept.

I did try asking a colleague for advice on a coding project, like you suggested. It was a bit nerve-wracking, but it went better than I expected. She was really supportive and gave me some great feedback. It felt good to know that I could rely on her, and it didn’t make me feel weak at all. In fact, it made me feel more connected to my team, which is something I’ve been missing.

As for the self-compassion exercises, I’ve been experimenting with different approaches. I tried a guided meditation app, and it was actually quite calming. It helped me focus on my breath and just be present in the moment, which is something I rarely do. I’m still working on writing those kind letters to myself, but it’s getting a bit easier. I’m trying to be more gentle with

Therapist: It sounds like Alicia has made some progress in recognizing the value of asking for help and being vulnerable, and has even practiced asking for help in a low-stakes situation. She's also started to explore self-compassion exercises, such as using a guided meditation app.

Some possible next steps could be:

* **Cognitive restructuring:** Help Alicia to continue to challenge her negative thoughts and reframe her perceptions of asking for help as a sign of strength, rather than weakness.
* **Behavioral experiments:** Encourage Alicia to continue to practice asking for help in different situations, such as seeking feedback from a friend or family member, to build her confidence and comfort level with vulnerability.
* **Self-compassion skills training:** Help Alicia to continue to develop self-compassion skills through exercises such as writing kind letters, practicing mindfulness, or using a guided meditation.
* **Values-based action:** Help Alicia to identify her core values and connect them to her behavior, such as valuing independence and self-reliance, but also valuing growth, learning, and building strong relationships.

Some possible questions to explore in the next session could be:

* How did Alicia's experience of asking for help in a low-stakes situation affect her perception of vulnerability and strength?
* What specific situations or challenges does Alicia still struggle with in terms of asking for help or being vulnerable?
* How can Alicia continue to develop self-compassion skills to counteract her critical inner voice and build a more positive and accepting relationship with herself?
* How can Alicia integrate her newfound understanding of vulnerability and strength into her daily life and relationships?

Patient: ### Session 12: Integrating Vulnerability

**Alicia:**
Nova, I’ve been reflecting on our last session, and I think I’m starting to see the value in asking for help and being vulnerable. The experience of asking my colleague for advice on the coding project really opened my eyes. It didn’t make me feel weak; instead, it made me feel more connected and supported. It was a small step, but it felt like a big shift in my mindset.

I’ve also continued with the self-compassion exercises. The guided meditation app has been really helpful. It’s become part of my daily routine, and it’s making me more aware of my thoughts and feelings. I’m still working on writing those kind letters to myself, but I’m getting better at being gentle with myself. It’s a slow process, but I’m making progress.

However, there are still some situations where I struggle with asking for help. For example, I find it really hard to ask for emotional support from friends or family. It feels like I’m burdening them, even though I know that’s not true. How can I work on this?

**Nova:**
Alicia, it’s great to hear about your progress with asking for help and practicing self-compassion. The fact that you’re integrating these exercises into your daily routine is a significant step
