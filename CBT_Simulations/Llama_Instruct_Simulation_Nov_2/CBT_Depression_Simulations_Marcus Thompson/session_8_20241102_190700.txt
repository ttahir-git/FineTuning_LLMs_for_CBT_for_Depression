Therapist: Welcome back to our session, Marcus! It's great to see you again. I've reviewed our previous session and am pleased to see that you've been actively practicing the kindness meditation and tracking your feelings. Can you tell me a bit more about your experience with these exercises? How have you found it? Have you noticed any changes in your thoughts or emotions, particularly around your perfectionism and guilt?

Patient: Hey, Nova. Thanks for having me back. I've been trying to stick to that kindness meditation before bed, and I have to say, it's been a mixed bag. Some nights, it feels really good—like I'm giving myself a break for once. Other nights, I find myself zoning out or thinking about all the things I need to do the next day. 

As for changes, I think I'm catching myself being more critical less often. Like, I'll start to think, "You didn't do enough for your students today," and then I'll remember to ask myself, "Why do I think that? Is it really true?" It's helping me step back a bit, but I still have a long way to go.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your experience with the kindness meditation and tracking your feelings, Marcus. It takes a lot of courage to be honest about the mixed results. It's great to hear that you're catching yourself being more critical less often, and that's definitely a step in the right direction.

It's also understandable that you'd find it challenging to stick to the meditation practice, especially if you're someone who tends to get caught up in thoughts about work or responsibilities. However, the fact that you're recognizing the pattern of zoning out or thinking about tasks to be done suggests that your self-awareness is growing.

Can I ask, what do you think might be the underlying reasons for the varying levels of success with the kindness meditation? Is there something specific that triggers the zoning out or critical thinking when you're trying to practice kindness towards yourself?

Additionally, let's build on the progress you've made with challenging critical thoughts. When you catch yourself thinking, "You didn't do enough for your students today," what is it that you're hoping to achieve by reframing that thought? What's the desired outcome?

Patient: You're right, Nova. I think the varying success with the meditation might be tied to how tired I am or how much stress I'm carrying that day. If I've had a particularly rough day at school or with my mom, my mind just doesn't want to slow down. It's like it's too wound up to relax.

As for the critical thoughts, I guess I'm hoping that by reframing them, I can stop beating myself up so much. I want to feel like I'm doing enough, like I'm not constantly falling short. It's hard because I've always pushed myself to be the best, to make a difference, and when I don't feel like I'm meeting those high standards, it eats at me. So, the desired outcome is to feel more balanced, less like I'm failing all the time.

Therapist: Thank you, Marcus, for your honest reflection on the challenges you're facing with the kindness meditation and your critical thoughts. It's great that you've identified some patterns, such as your energy levels and stress, that might be impacting your ability to practice self-compassion. That self-awareness is a huge step forward.

Regarding the zoning out or critical thinking, I'd like to suggest a few possibilities. Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed or stuck, our minds might resort to familiar patterns of thought, like rumination or perfectionism, as a way of coping. It's possible that your mind is using these patterns as a way to temporarily escape from the emotions or stress you're experiencing.

It might be helpful to experiment with some modifications to your kindness meditation practice. For example, you could try starting with shorter sessions or practicing the meditation at a different time of day when you're feeling more energized. You could also try incorporating some physical relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, to help calm your body and mind before practicing the meditation.

Regarding your goal of reframing critical thoughts, I'd like to ask: What would it mean for you to feel more balanced, less like you're failing all the time? What would that look like in your daily life and interactions? Is there a specific scenario or situation where you'd feel more confident or competent?

Additionally, I'd like to explore this idea of "not constantly falling short." What would happen if you allowed yourself to acknowledge and accept that you're doing the best you can, rather than striving for an impossible perfection? How might that shift your experience and your relationships with others?

Let's work together to unpack these questions and see if we can uncover some new insights that can help you build on the progress you've made so far.

Patient: Thanks for the suggestions, Nova. I think trying shorter sessions or practicing at a different time of day could help. Maybe I'll give that a shot.

As for feeling more balanced, I guess it would mean being able to focus better during the day, not feeling so drained by the end of it. It would be nice to feel like I'm making a difference without constantly second-guessing myself. Like, if I could just trust that I'm doing okay, that would be huge.

A specific scenario where I'd feel more confident? Hmm, maybe during parent-teacher conferences. I always feel like I have to prove myself, like I'm not just a teacher but a savior for these kids. If I could just be myself and trust that I'm doing my best, that would be a big relief.

And about accepting that I'm doing the best I can—that's tough. I've always been driven to be the best, to make a real impact. But maybe if I could let go of that a bit, I wouldn't feel so overwhelmed all the time. It's like I'm carrying this huge weight of expectations, and it's exhausting.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a significant burden of self-expectation, Marcus. It's understandable that you'd want to make a difference in your students' lives, but the weight of that responsibility can be crushing. I'd like to explore this idea of "letting go" of the need to be perfect or make a huge impact. What do you think would happen if you started to reframe your expectations, not to say you're not good enough, but to say that you're doing the best you can with the resources you have?

Let's consider the idea of "good enough." Would it be helpful to explore what "good enough" means to you? Is it about achieving certain results, receiving certain praise or recognition, or is it about something more intrinsic, like feeling content with your work or being at peace with yourself?

Additionally, I'd like to ask: What are some of the messages you've received from others, whether from your family, teachers, or society at large, that may have contributed to your perfectionist tendencies? Have you ever noticed any patterns or inconsistencies in how people react to your achievements or mistakes?

Lastly, I'd like to introduce a new concept to work with: the idea of "compassionate self-inquiry." This involves being gentle and non-judgmental towards yourself as you explore your thoughts, feelings, and actions. Would you be willing to practice self-inquiry with me, exploring what it means to be compassionate towards yourself, even when you're not meeting your own high standards?

Patient: You're right, Nova. The weight of those expectations is definitely crushing. I think reframing my expectations to just doing the best I can with what I have could help. It's not about lowering the bar, but about being realistic and kind to myself.

As for "good enough," I guess it's a mix of both. I want to see results, like my students improving and feeling more confident. But I also want to feel content with my work, like I'm not constantly chasing some unattainable goal. It's about finding a balance, I think.

Messages from others? Growing up, my mom always told me to aim high, to be the best I could be. She worked so hard to provide for us, and I think I internalized that as needing to be perfect. In school, teachers praised me for being a high achiever, but they also expected a lot. It's like I've always felt this pressure to live up to those high standards.

Patterns or inconsistencies? Definitely. Sometimes people praise me for my achievements, but other times, they seem to expect even more. It's like no matter what I do, it's never quite enough. That's been tough to deal with.

Compassionate self-inquiry sounds like a good idea. I'm willing to try it. I think being gentle with myself, even when I'm not meeting my

Therapist: It sounds like you're making some great progress, Marcus. You're recognizing the weight of your expectations and the impact it's having on your well-being. It's wonderful that you're willing to explore what it means to be compassionate towards yourself, even when you're not meeting your own high standards.

Let's dive into compassionate self-inquiry. Can you tell me, what would it mean for you to be kind and understanding towards yourself when you make a mistake or don't meet your expectations? How would you talk to yourself in those moments?

Also, I'd like to ask, have you noticed any situations or interactions where you're more likely to be kind and compassionate towards others, but not towards yourself? For example, would you be more understanding with a friend who's struggling, but less so with yourself when you're facing similar challenges?

Let's also work on reframing your expectations. What if, instead of aiming for perfection, you aimed for "good enough" or "doing the best I can with what I have"? How might that change your approach to your work and your relationships? Would you be more relaxed, more focused, or more confident in your abilities?

Lastly, I'd like to introduce a technique called "self-compassion letters." Would you be willing to write a letter to yourself, acknowledging your struggles, and offering kindness and understanding? This can help you develop a more compassionate relationship with yourself and cultivate a sense of self-acceptance.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I think being kind and understanding towards myself when I make a mistake would mean not beating myself up so much. Instead of saying, "You messed up again," I'd try to say, "It's okay, you're doing your best, and that's enough." It's about giving myself the same grace I'd give to a friend.

Yeah, I definitely notice that I'm more compassionate towards others than myself. If a friend is struggling, I'll offer support and understanding, but when it comes to me, I'm quick to criticize. It's like I hold myself to a higher standard, and that's not fair.

Reframing my expectations to "good enough" or "doing the best I can with what I have" could definitely change things. I think I'd be more relaxed and focused, less stressed out about trying to be perfect. It would be a relief to know that my best is good enough, and that I don't have to constantly prove myself.

I'm willing to try the self-compassion letters. It sounds like a good way to start being kinder to myself. I'll write a letter acknowledging my struggles and offering kindness and understanding. I think it could really help me see myself in a more compassionate light.

Therapist: It sounds like we've had a very productive session, Marcus. I'm impressed by your willingness to explore and challenge your perfectionist tendencies and critical self-talk. You're taking some huge steps towards developing a more compassionate and realistic approach to your work and relationships.

I'd like to summarize some of the key insights we've discussed today:

1. You've identified some patterns and triggers that impact your ability to practice kindness meditation, such as feeling tired or overwhelmed.
2. You're recognizing the weight of your self-expectations and the impact it's having on your well-being.
3. You're willing to explore the concept of "good enough" and reframing your expectations to focus on "doing the best you can with what you have."
4. You're recognizing the importance of being kind and compassionate towards yourself, even when you make mistakes or don't meet your expectations.

For homework, I'd like you to:

1. Continue practicing kindness meditation, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. Experiment with different techniques, such as starting with shorter sessions or practicing at a different time of day.
2. Write a self-compassion letter to yourself, acknowledging your struggles and offering kindness and understanding.
3. Practice reframing your self-critical thoughts by asking yourself questions like "Is this thought really true?" or "Is there another way to look at this situation?"
4. Reflect on situations where you're more likely to be kind and compassionate towards others, but not towards yourself. Identify ways to apply that same compassion to yourself.

Remember, Marcus, that developing self-compassion and challenging perfectionism is a process that takes time and practice. Be patient and kind to yourself as you work through these exercises and continue to explore your thoughts and feelings.

Before we wrap up, I'd like to give you a small exercise to try before our next session. I'd like you to carry a small note or card with you that says, "I'm doing the best I can." Whenever you notice yourself feeling stressed or critical, take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can with what you have. See how that feels and what impact it has on your thoughts and emotions.

Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or explore before we wrap up today's session?

Patient: Thanks for the summary, Nova. It's good to have all that in mind. I'll definitely work on those homework assignments.

The small note idea sounds helpful. I'll carry it with me and see how it goes. It's a simple reminder, but sometimes those little things can make a big difference.

I think that's it for today. I appreciate your support and guidance. I'm looking forward to our next session and seeing how these exercises help.

Therapist: It sounds like we've had a very productive session, Marcus. I'm impressed by your willingness to explore and challenge your perfectionist tendencies and critical self-talk. You're taking some huge steps towards developing a more compassionate and realistic approach to your work and relationships.

As we wrap up today's session, I want to remind you that developing self-compassion and challenging perfectionism is a process that takes time and practice. Be patient and kind to yourself as you work through these exercises and continue to explore your thoughts and feelings.

Remember, it's okay to make mistakes and it's okay to not be perfect. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Don't be too hard on yourself if you encounter setbacks or challenges along the way. Instead, use those opportunities to learn and grow.

Before we go, I'd like to leave you with a final thought. As you go about your day, remember to be gentle with yourself. Treat yourself with the same kindness and compassion that you would offer to a friend. And whenever you notice yourself feeling stressed or critical, take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can.

I'll see you at our next session, Marcus. Keep up the great work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any support or guidance along the way.
