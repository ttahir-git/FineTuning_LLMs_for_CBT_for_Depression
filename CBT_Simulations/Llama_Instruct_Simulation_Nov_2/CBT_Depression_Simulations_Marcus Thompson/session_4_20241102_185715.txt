Therapist: Welcome back to our 4th session, Marcus! I'm glad to see you've made significant progress in recognizing the sources of your guilt related to boundary-setting and understanding the importance of "enoughness" in your various roles. It's also great to see that you've been practicing self-compassion and setting boundaries at work.

Before we dive in, how have you been feeling about your progress so far? Have there been any challenges or setbacks that have come up since our last session?

Also, I noticed that you mentioned reaching out to family members about helping with your mother's care as part of your homework. How did that conversation go, and have you made any progress in that area?

Remember, this is a safe and non-judgmental space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. I'm here to support you in your journey towards developing healthier boundaries and improving your overall well-being.

Patient: Thanks for the warm welcome, Nova. I've been feeling a bit mixed about my progress. On one hand, I've been sticking to leaving work by 5 PM, which has been a big change for me. It feels strange at first, but I think it's helping me be more present with my kids and mom. On the other hand, I still catch myself feeling guilty about not being at work longer, especially when I see my colleagues staying late.

As for reaching out to family members about helping with my mom's care, it was tougher than I expected. I talked to my cousins and some close family friends, but they all have their own busy lives. They offered to help occasionally, but not on a regular basis. It's hard not to feel like I'm shouldering most of the responsibility alone. I guess I need to keep looking for more support, but it's discouraging when people can't commit.

Overall, I'm trying to stay positive and keep practicing that self-compassion phrase when the guilt hits. It's a work in progress, but I'm determined to keep moving forward.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me, Marcus. It takes a lot of courage to admit when things are tough, especially when it comes to seeking support.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge your efforts in sticking to your work schedule and practicing self-compassion. That's no small feat, and it's clear that you're committed to making progress. The fact that you're still feeling guilty about not working longer hours is understandable, given your childhood experiences and the messages you received about being a good son and student. It's like there's a voice inside you that's still trying to prove itself, even though you're doing your best.

Regarding your conversation with family members about helping with your mom's care, I can understand why it's been tough to get the support you need. It's not uncommon for people to mean well but struggle to follow through, especially when they're busy with their own lives. It's possible that you might need to reframe your expectations around what's realistic and possible for them to provide.

Rather than feeling discouraged, let's explore some possible next steps together. Have you considered reaching out to other family members or friends who might be more available to help? Or, have you thought about exploring other options for caregiving support, such as home health care or adult day programs?

Remember, seeking help isn't a sign of weakness; it's a sign of strength and a willingness to prioritize your own well-being and your mom's care. What do you think about exploring some of these options further?

Also, I want to check in with you about your self-compassion practice. Have you been using the reframing phrase consistently, and if so, how has it been helping you cope with guilt and anxiety?

Patient: I appreciate your understanding, Nova. It's true, there's a lot of pressure from both my past and present to keep pushing myself. I've been trying to use the reframing phrase, and it's helped a bit in moments of stress. It's like I can remind myself that I'm doing enough, even when everything feels like it's piling up.

As for reaching out to family members, I did speak with a few cousins and my aunt, and they were sympathetic but didn't offer much practical help. It's frustrating, but I understand everyone has their own lives and responsibilities. I've looked into home health care options, and there's a service that my mom's doctor recommended. They offer part-time assistance, which might be a good start.

I'm hesitant because I want to be there for her myself, but I know it's not sustainable to keep running between her place, my kids, and my job. It's tough to accept that I can't do it all on my own. Do you have any suggestions for how to balance this without feeling so guilty?

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me, Marcus. I can sense the weight of responsibility you're carrying, and it's completely understandable that you want to be there for your mom.

Firstly, let's acknowledge that you're already taking steps towards finding additional support, which is a huge accomplishment. Exploring home health care options is a great start, and I encourage you to pursue that further. It's possible that this could be a game-changer for you and your mom, allowing you to maintain a better work-life balance and alleviate some of the guilt you're carrying.

Regarding balancing your responsibilities without feeling guilty, I'd like to suggest a few reframes that might help. Remember, your worth and value aren't defined by your ability to do everything yourself. In fact, seeking help can be a sign of strength and a willingness to prioritize your own well-being and your mom's care.

Let's try to reframe the idea of "not being able to do it all on your own" as a sign of self-awareness and self-compassion. Instead of beating yourself up over it, you could try saying to yourself, "I'm doing the best I can with the resources I have, and that's enough." This phrase can help you accept that you can't do everything, and that it's okay to ask for help.

Another reframing idea might be to focus on the benefits of having additional support. Instead of feeling guilty for not being able to take care of your mom yourself, you could try focusing on the positive impact that home health care might have on her quality of life. You might say to yourself, "By seeking help, I'm giving my mom the opportunity to receive the care she needs, and I'm also taking care of my own well-being. That's something to be proud of!"

Lastly, remember that you're not alone in this journey. I'm here to support you, and we can work together to develop a plan that feels sustainable and manageable for you. What do you think about exploring some of these reframes and ideas further, and seeing how they might help you navigate your responsibilities with greater ease and compassion?

Also, I'd like to ask, what do you think about scheduling a session with a social worker or a caregiver support specialist to help you explore your options and find the right resources for your mom? This could be a great way to get more support and guidance in navigating this complex situation.

Session Summary:

I hear how much you're wrestling with wanting to be there for your mom while recognizing your own limitations. It's a difficult balance, and your hesitation about accepting outside help is completely understandable. The fact that you're considering home health care shows that you're thinking practically about what's best for both you and your mom, even though it's emotionally challenging.

Let's explore this further. What specific concerns do you have about bringing in home health care? Sometimes understanding our reservations can help us work through them more effectively. Also, how do you think your mom might feel about having additional support?

Remember, accepting help doesn't diminish your role as a son or make you any less caring. In fact, recognizing when we need support and taking steps to get it can actually make us more effective caregivers. What are your thoughts about that?

I also want to acknowledge that you're already making positive changes by maintaining your work boundaries and using the self-compassion phrase. These are important steps in taking care of yourself. How do you think having some additional support might impact your ability to be present with both your mom and your children?
