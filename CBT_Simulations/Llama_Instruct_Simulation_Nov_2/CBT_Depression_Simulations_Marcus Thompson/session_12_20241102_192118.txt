Therapist: Hello Marcus, nice to see you again. I've taken note of our previous session and the progress you've made with the Time Cube exercise. Before we dive in, how have things been since our last session? Have you started implementing the Time Cube system and tracking your progress as assigned?

Patient: Hey, Nova. It's good to see you too. Yeah, I've been trying to stick to the Time Cube system, but it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days I feel like I'm getting a handle on things, and other days it feels like I'm just adding another layer of stress. I've been tracking my progress, though. I can show you the notes if you want.

Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again too! Congratulations on taking the first step towards implementing the Time Cube system, even if it's been a bit rocky so far. That takes a lot of courage.

I'd love to see your notes on how it's been going. Please feel free to share them with me. I'm curious to hear more about the days when you feel like you're getting a handle on things, and the days when it feels like too much.

Before we dive into the specifics, I want to acknowledge that it's completely normal for this process to feel overwhelming, especially with so many responsibilities on your plate. It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of a seesaw effect, where you're feeling more in control on some days, but struggling on others.

Let's take a moment to reflect on what you think might be contributing to this rollercoaster effect. Is there anything specific that's making it harder for you to stick to the Time Cube system, or any particular challenges that keep arising?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. Yeah, it's definitely been a mix of both. On the good days, I feel like I'm actually making progress. I've been able to carve out some dedicated time for lesson planning, which has made my classes more engaging. I've also managed to spend more quality time with my kids, which has been great.

But on the tougher days, it's like everything piles up. My mom's condition seems to be getting worse, and I'm finding it harder to balance her care with everything else. Plus, there are always unexpected things that come up at school or in the community that throw off my schedule.

I think the main challenge is that I'm still trying to do too much. Even with the Time Cube, I'm squeezing in too many tasks, and it's leaving me feeling stretched thin. I know I need to be more realistic about what I can handle, but it's hard to let go of some things, especially when I feel like they're important.

Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a common challenge many people face when implementing new time management systems: the tendency to overload yourself with too many tasks and responsibilities.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that it's amazing that you've been able to make progress and carve out dedicated time for lesson planning and quality time with your kids. Those are significant accomplishments, and it's clear that you're committed to making positive changes.

Now, let's explore this idea of trying to do too much. Can you tell me more about what's driving this need to take on so many responsibilities? Is it a sense of obligation, a fear of failure, or something else entirely?

Additionally, I'd like to propose an exercise to help you better understand your priorities and boundaries. Let's work on creating a "Stop Doing" list. This can be a powerful tool to help you let go of tasks and responsibilities that are no longer serving you or causing more stress than they're worth.

What are some things that you've been doing, but might need to stop or delegate, given your current circumstances? This might include things like taking on too much at school, overcommitting to community work, or even trying to manage your mom's care on your own.

Remember, it's okay to say no to things that don't align with your priorities or that are causing you undue stress. Let's work together to identify areas where you can realistically let go and make space for more manageable responsibilities.

How does this sound, Marcus?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's been a mixed bag since the last session. On some days, I've managed to stick to the Time Cube pretty well. I've been setting aside specific times for lesson planning, and I've been getting home earlier to spend quality time with Jamal and Aisha. Those days feel productive and less overwhelming.

But then there are days when I slip up. I get caught up in community work or helping students outside of class, and suddenly, the day is over, and I haven't checked off everything I needed to. I end up feeling guilty and like I've let everyone down.

I think part of the issue is that I'm driven by a sense of obligation. Growing up in a single-parent household, I learned early on that you have to work hard and take on responsibilities to get by. I feel like if I don't do everything, who will? This sense of duty is strong, and it's hard for me to let go of tasks, even when they're not mine to carry.

Creating a "Stop Doing" list sounds helpful. I know I need to prioritize better, but it's tough to know where to start. I've been trying to manage my mom's care on my own, but it's draining me. Maybe that's something I need to delegate or seek more support for. And I've been taking on too

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling with a strong sense of obligation and a fear of not being able to meet others' needs. This can be a heavy burden to carry, especially when it's tied to your past experiences and sense of responsibility.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that your sense of duty is a powerful motivator, and it's clear that you're committed to helping others. However, it's also important to recognize that taking on too much can have negative consequences, not just for you, but also for those you care about.

Creating a "Stop Doing" list can be a helpful exercise in identifying areas where you might be overcommitting or taking on too much. But I also want to gently challenge the idea that you need to do everything yourself. It's okay to ask for help, delegate tasks, or seek support from others.

Let's take a step back and look at your situation more closely. Who are the people you're trying to meet the needs for? Your mom, your children, your students, your community? Are there any specific expectations or pressures that are driving your sense of obligation?

It might also be helpful to explore the idea of "enough." What does enough look like for you in your current circumstances? Are there certain tasks or responsibilities that you can realistically let go of without feeling guilty or like you're abandoning others?

Remember, taking care of yourself and setting boundaries is not selfish; it's necessary for maintaining your physical, emotional, and mental well-being. By prioritizing your own needs, you'll be better equipped to show up for others in a more sustainable and healthy way.

Let's work together to create that "Stop Doing" list and explore ways to delegate or seek support where possible. How does that sound, Marcus?

Patient: That sounds like a good approach, Nova. I can definitely see how taking on too much is hurting me and the people I care about. It's like I'm trying to be a superhero for everyone, but I end up feeling exhausted and ineffective.

I think my strong sense of obligation comes from growing up in a single-parent household where my mom worked multiple jobs to support us. I always felt like I had to step up and help her, even as a kid. Now, as an adult, it's like I can't shake that mentality. I feel guilty if I'm not constantly doing something to help others, whether it's my students, my kids, or my mom.

Creating a "Stop Doing" list makes sense, but honestly, I don't know where to start. It feels like everything is important, and I'm worried that if I stop doing something, it will fall through the cracks. But I know I can't keep going like this. I need to find a way to balance everything without feeling like I'm failing.

Do you have any suggestions for how to start making that list? What kinds of things should I consider including?

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling with a strong sense of obligation and a fear of not being able to meet others' needs. This can be a heavy burden to carry, especially when it's tied to your past experiences and sense of responsibility.

Let's start by brainstorming together. Can you think of any tasks or responsibilities that you've been doing consistently, but that might not be essential or could be delegated to others? For example, are there any community events or commitments that you feel like you need to attend, but that might not be crucial to your well-being or the well-being of others?

Another approach is to think about the tasks that make you feel most overwhelmed or stressed. Which ones are they, and can you consider ways to break them down or delegate them to others? For instance, if you're managing your mom's care on your own, could you consider seeking support from family members, friends, or healthcare professionals?

We can also explore the concept of "good enough." What does it look like for you to do something "good enough" rather than trying to do everything perfectly? Can you think of examples where doing "good enough" might be acceptable, even if it's not ideal?

Lastly, let's talk about self-care. What are some activities or habits that nourish your mind, body, and spirit? Are there any things that you've been putting off or neglecting because you feel like you don't have time for them? We can work on incorporating more self-care into your daily routine to help you feel more energized and motivated.

To start creating your "Stop Doing" list, let's try a simple exercise. Take a piece of paper and write down everything you're doing regularly. Then, next to each task, write a small letter next to it, such as "D" for delegate, "C" for cut back, or "E" for eliminate. This will help you visualize where you might be able to make some changes.

Remember, this is not about cutting out things that are truly important, but about finding ways to prioritize what's essential and letting go of things that are holding you back. We'll work together to identify areas where you can realistically cut back or delegate tasks, and explore ways to make self-care a non-negotiable part of your daily routine.

How does this sound, Marcus?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I can definitely see how some tasks might not be essential and could be delegated or cut back on. Let's start with brainstorming.

One thing that comes to mind is the community events I attend. I feel like I need to be there for everything, but realistically, I can't. Maybe I can start by cutting back on the number of events I attend each month.

Another area is my mom's care. I've been trying to do everything myself, but I know I need to seek more support. Maybe I can look into hiring a part-time caregiver or asking family members to help out more.

As for self-care, I've been neglecting my own needs. I used to run every morning, but lately, I've been skipping it to get more work done. I know I need to prioritize that again because it helps me clear my mind and stay focused.

I'll start by writing down everything I'm doing regularly and categorize them as you suggested. I think this exercise will help me see where I can make some changes. Thanks for the guidance, Nova.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making some great progress, Marcus. I'm impressed by your willingness to acknowledge the areas where you can improve and your commitment to making changes.

Before we move forward, I want to summarize the key points we've discussed:

* You've been implementing the Time Cube system, but it's been a mixed bag. Some days you feel like you're getting a handle on things, while others feel overwhelming.
* You've identified some specific challenges, including your tendency to take on too much and your strong sense of obligation to others.
* We've discussed creating a "Stop Doing" list to help you identify areas where you can cut back or delegate tasks.
* You've started brainstorming potential areas to cut back, including community events and your mom's care.
* We've also talked about the importance of self-care and prioritizing activities that nourish your mind, body, and spirit.

To further support your progress, I'd like to suggest a few additional exercises:

* Next time you're feeling overwhelmed, try to identify the tasks that are contributing to that feeling. Are there any tasks that you can delegate or cut back on?
* Practice saying "no" to requests that don't align with your priorities or values. Remember, it's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs.
* Schedule time for self-care into your daily routine. This might mean taking a 10-minute walk each morning or dedicating 30 minutes to meditation each day.
* Consider seeking support from others, whether it's a friend, family member, or professional. You don't have to do everything on your own.

Remember, making changes takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up. You're making progress, and that's something to be proud of.

Before we wrap up, I'd like to schedule a review of your Time Cube progress for our next session. Are you available to come in at the same time next week?

Patient: Thanks for the summary, Nova. It's helpful to have everything laid out like that. I appreciate the additional exercises you suggested. I'll definitely try to identify the tasks that contribute to my feeling overwhelmed and practice saying "no" more often.

As for scheduling, I can come in at the same time next week. I'll make sure to keep track of my progress with the Time Cube and self-care activities so we can review them then.

I'm feeling a bit more hopeful about making these changes. It's going to take some time, but I'm committed to finding a better balance. Thanks for your support, Nova.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making some great progress, Marcus. I'm proud of you for being honest about your challenges and for being willing to try new things.

Remember, it's a process to make changes, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up - just acknowledge it and try to do better next time.

I'm looking forward to our next session and reviewing your progress with the Time Cube and your self-care activities. In the meantime, keep up the good work and remember to be kind to yourself.

Before we wrap up, I'd like to leave you with a final thought. You've been saying yes to a lot of things lately, and that's great. But remember that saying no is also okay. In fact, it's often necessary. Don't be afraid to say no to things that don't align with your priorities or values. Your time and energy are precious, and you deserve to use them wisely.

Keep in mind that it's not selfish to prioritize yourself. In fact, it's necessary for maintaining your physical, emotional, and mental well-being. By taking care of yourself, you'll be better equipped to show up for others in a more sustainable and healthy way.

Remember, you got this, Marcus. You're capable and strong, and you can do this.

Next steps:

* Continue to implement the Time Cube system and track your progress
* Practice saying no to requests that don't align with your priorities or values
* Schedule time for self-care into your daily routine
* Seek support from others when needed

Let's schedule our next session for the same time next week. I'll see you then, and we'll review your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plan.

Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have before we wrap up?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the encouragement and the reminder that it's okay to say no sometimes. I'll definitely keep that in mind as I move forward.

I think I'm good for now. I'll continue to track my progress with the Time Cube and make sure to schedule some self-care time each day. I'm looking forward to our next session and seeing how things have improved.

Thanks again for your support, Nova. I'll see you next week.
