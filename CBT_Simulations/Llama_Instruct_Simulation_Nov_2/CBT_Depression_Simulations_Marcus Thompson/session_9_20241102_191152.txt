Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again in session 9. Before we dive into today's topics, how did you find the last session's homework and exercises? Did you notice any progress or challenges in implementing the kindness meditation practice, writing self-compassion letters, and using the reminder note? 

Also, I'd like to review your progress on recognizing and reframing self-critical thoughts, as well as reflecting on situations where perfectionism is most challenging. Have you experienced any shifts in your thinking patterns or behaviors since our last session?

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for the session. The last exercises were a bit challenging, but I'm seeing some positive changes. The kindness meditation practice felt weird at first, but it's starting to bring a bit of calm. Writing self-compassion letters was tough—I guess I'm just not used to being that nice to myself. I did take the reminder note with me, and it helped a few times when I felt that wave of guilt or pressure.

As for recognizing self-critical thoughts, I'm getting better at catching them, especially during lesson planning. It’s like I’m always waiting for that moment when things don’t go well, but I’m trying to pause and reframe it. It's not easy, but I'm making an effort. Perfectionism is still a struggle, especially with my mom’s condition and the kids. I find myself worrying all the time about not doing enough, but I’m slowly learning to appreciate what I can manage.

Therapist: It sounds like you've made some good progress since our last session, Marcus. It's great to hear that the kindness meditation practice is bringing you some calm, even if it didn't feel natural at first. And I'm glad you're taking the reminder note with you and finding it helpful.

Recognizing and reframing self-critical thoughts is a process, and it's impressive that you're making an effort to catch them, especially during challenging situations like lesson planning. It's also wonderful that you're acknowledging your limitations and trying to appreciate what you can manage, rather than getting caught up in worries about not doing enough.

One thing that stood out to me from our session summary is the connection you made between perfectionism and your mom's condition and the kids. Can you tell me more about what you mean by that? How do you think your experiences with your mom and the kids are contributing to your perfectionistic tendencies?

Also, I want to ask about the self-compassion letters. What was the most challenging part of writing those letters for you, and how do you think they could be more effective in helping you develop self-compassion?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. Yeah, the connection between my perfectionism and my mom's condition and the kids is pretty strong. With my mom, it's like I feel this intense pressure to be perfect in my caregiving, to make sure I'm doing everything right, because I know how much she sacrificed for me growing up. And with the kids, I want to be the perfect dad, the one who always has it together, especially after the divorce. I guess I'm afraid that if I slip up, I'll be letting them down, just like I feel like I let my mom down sometimes.

As for the self-compassion letters, the most challenging part was really putting myself in the shoes of someone I deeply care about and trying to give myself the same kindness and understanding. It felt almost fake at first, like I was lying to myself. I think they could be more effective if I could find a way to make them feel more genuine, more like something I truly believe rather than just words on paper. Maybe if I could connect them to real memories or moments where I've shown compassion to others, it might help.

Therapist: It sounds like you've made some significant connections, Marcus. The pressure to be perfect for your mom and the kids is a heavy burden to carry. It's no wonder you're struggling with perfectionism.

First, let's acknowledge that your desire to be a good caregiver and father is rooted in love and a sense of responsibility. That's a beautiful thing. However, it's also essential to recognize that your mom's expectations and your own fears of letting others down have created an unrealistic and unhealthy standard for yourself.

Regarding the self-compassion letters, I think you're on the right track by wanting to make them feel more genuine and connected to your experiences. One exercise we could try is to explore the idea of "small, specific, and realistic" self-compassion. Instead of trying to write a grand, sweeping letter to yourself, we could focus on writing small, specific letters that acknowledge and validate your experiences.

For example, we could write a letter to yourself after a particularly challenging lesson, acknowledging your efforts and the challenges you faced. Or, we could write a letter to yourself when you're feeling anxious about your mom's condition, recognizing that it's okay to feel scared and overwhelmed, and that you're doing the best you can.

The goal is to make these letters feel more authentic and connected to your experiences, rather than just a generic exercise. We could also explore ways to incorporate more sensory details and memories into your self-compassion letters, to help them feel more real and genuine.

How does that sound, Marcus? Would you be willing to give it a try and see if it feels more effective for you?

Patient: That sounds like a good approach, Nova. I think breaking it down into smaller, more specific letters could help make it feel more real and less like a chore. I can definitely see how acknowledging my efforts after a tough lesson or when I'm feeling anxious about my mom could be more effective. It might help me connect with those moments better and feel more genuine compassion for myself.

I'm willing to give it a try. It might take some time to get used to, but I think it could be a step in the right direction. I'll focus on writing those smaller, specific letters and see how it goes. Thanks for the suggestion.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling more hopeful about the self-compassion letters, Marcus. Breaking them down into smaller, more specific letters is a great way to make them feel more manageable and authentic. I'm glad we could brainstorm a new approach together that feels more accessible to you.

As we move forward with this exercise, I want to encourage you to be kind to yourself and not worry if it doesn't feel perfect at first. It's a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Remember, the goal is to cultivate self-compassion and understanding, not to write a flawless letter.

Before we wrap up this session, I want to check in with you about your progress on the reminder note. You mentioned earlier that it helped you a few times when you felt that wave of guilt or pressure. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that tend to make you feel that way? Are there any situations or thoughts that seem to set you off more than others?

Also, I'd like to explore further how you can apply the kindness meditation practice and the self-compassion letters to your daily life, especially in situations where perfectionism tends to creep in. Let's brainstorm some ways you can integrate these practices into your daily routine, so you can continue to build on the progress you've made.

How does that sound, Marcus?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the encouragement. Yeah, the reminder note has been helpful, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed or guilty. Some patterns I've noticed are when I'm planning lessons or dealing with my mom's care. Those are the times when I tend to feel the most pressure and start beating myself up.

For integrating the kindness meditation and self-compassion letters into my daily routine, I think starting my day with a short meditation could help set a positive tone. Maybe even just a few minutes before I start lesson planning or head over to my mom's. And for the letters, I could try writing one right after a tough lesson or a stressful visit with my mom. It might help me process those feelings better and not let them build up.

I'm open to any other suggestions you might have. I want to keep making progress and find ways to make these practices more a part of my daily life.

Therapist: It sounds like we've made some significant progress in this session, Marcus. I'm glad we were able to brainstorm a new approach to the self-compassion letters that feels more accessible to you. Remember, it's okay to take it one step at a time and be kind to yourself as you work on this exercise.

Regarding the reminder note, it's great that you've been able to identify some patterns and triggers that tend to make you feel pressure or guilt. Recognizing these patterns is a big step in being able to address them more effectively.

I love your idea of starting your day with a short kindness meditation to set a positive tone. That's a great way to integrate the practice into your daily routine. And writing a self-compassion letter after a tough lesson or stressful visit with your mom is a wonderful way to process your feelings and cultivate self-compassion.

Here's an exercise I'd like to assign to you for homework: for the next week, commit to writing one small, specific self-compassion letter each day. It can be after a lesson, a conversation with your mom, or even just a moment when you're feeling overwhelmed. The goal is to make it a habit and to start to feel more comfortable with the practice.

Additionally, I'd like you to explore ways to incorporate the kindness meditation into your daily routine, as you mentioned. Even just a few minutes a day can be beneficial. You can also try to carry the reminder note with you and refer to it whenever you feel pressure or guilt.

One more thing I'd like to suggest is to start to notice and challenge those self-critical thoughts that tend to pop up when you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed. We can work on some specific techniques to help you reframe those thoughts and cultivate a more compassionate mindset.

How does that sound, Marcus? Are you feeling more hopeful and motivated to continue making progress?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the encouragement and the homework assignment. Writing a self-compassion letter each day for the next week sounds doable, and I think it could really help. I'll also make sure to start my day with a short kindness meditation and keep the reminder note handy.

I'm feeling more hopeful and motivated to keep making progress. It's been a tough road, but I can see some positive changes starting to happen. I'm ready to keep pushing forward and finding ways to make these practices more a part of my daily life.

Thanks for the support, Nova. I'm looking forward to our next session and seeing how things go with the homework.
