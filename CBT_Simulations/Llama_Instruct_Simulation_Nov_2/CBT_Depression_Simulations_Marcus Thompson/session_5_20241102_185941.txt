Session Number: 5

Patient: Hi, I'm Marcus Thompson. This is my 5 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

I hear how much you're wrestling with wanting to be there for your mom while recognizing your own limitations. It's a difficult balance, and your hesitation about accepting outside help is completely understandable. The fact that you're considering home health care shows that you're thinking practically about what's best for both you and your mom, even though it's emotionally challenging.

Let's explore this further. What specific concerns do you have about bringing in home health care? Sometimes understanding our reservations can help us work through them more effectively. Also, how do you think your mom might feel about having additional support?

Remember, accepting help doesn't diminish your role as a son or make you any less caring. In fact, recognizing when we need support and taking steps to get it can actually make us more effective caregivers. What are your thoughts about that?

I also want to acknowledge that you're already making positive changes by maintaining your work boundaries and using the self-compassion phrase. These are important steps in taking care of yourself. How do you think having some additional support might impact your ability to be present with both your mom and your children?

Therapist: Hello Marcus. It's great to see you again. I'm glad we could pick up where we left off last session. You're doing some great work, and I want to commend you on recognizing the importance of setting boundaries and practicing self-compassion. That takes a lot of courage and self-awareness.

To respond to your question, I want to explore those specific concerns you mentioned about bringing in home health care. What are some of the worries or fears that are holding you back from pursuing this option? Is it the cost, the logistics of managing additional caregivers, or something else entirely? Sometimes, breaking down our concerns into smaller, more manageable parts can help us feel more in control and less overwhelmed.

Also, I want to acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel uncertain about how your mom might feel about having additional support. That can be a complex and emotional topic, especially if she's been relying on you for care. What are your thoughts on this? Have you talked to your mom about your concerns or potential feelings she might have about this?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's good to be back. I appreciate the encouragement about setting boundaries and practicing self-compassion. It's still a work in progress, but I'm trying.

Regarding home health care, my main concerns are twofold. First, there's the cost. With alimony, child support, and now potential home health care expenses, it feels like a financial burden that's hard to shoulder. I worry about stretching myself too thin financially. Second, there's the emotional aspect. My mom has always been fiercely independent, and I'm not sure how she'll react to having strangers in the house helping her. I don't want her to feel like she's losing her autonomy or that I'm abandoning her.

I haven't talked to her about it yet. I guess I'm afraid of her reaction and what it might mean for our relationship. I want to do what's best for her, but I also want to respect her wishes and dignity.

Therapist: Marcus, it sounds like you're carrying a heavy load, financially and emotionally. It's completely understandable that you're worried about the cost of home health care and how it might impact your financial stability. It's also natural that you're concerned about your mom's feelings and potential reaction to having strangers in the house.

First, let's break down the cost concern. We can explore some financial planning options together, such as discussing potential funding sources, budgeting, and prioritizing expenses. Sometimes, breaking down the financial aspects into smaller, manageable parts can make it feel less overwhelming.

Regarding your mom's potential reaction, it's great that you're considering her feelings and dignity. It's natural to want to respect her autonomy and independence. However, it might be helpful to remember that accepting help doesn't mean losing control or autonomy. In fact, having additional support can often give people a sense of security and freedom.

One possible approach could be to involve your mom in the decision-making process as much as possible. This way, she'll feel more invested and in control of her care. We can also explore ways to balance her needs with your own emotional well-being and boundaries.

Before we dive deeper into this, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to consider your mom's feelings and potential reactions. That shows you're thinking about her needs and wanting to do what's best for her. How do you think you'll feel if we can find a solution that works for both of you, and your mom is able to maintain her independence while also getting the support she needs?

Patient: Thanks for breaking it down, Nova. It does help to think about the financial aspects in smaller pieces. I'll admit, the idea of involving my mom in the decision-making process is both daunting and comforting. I want her to feel like she's still in control, but I also worry about how she'll handle the reality of her condition.

If we can find a solution that works for both of us, I think it would be a huge relief. I'd feel less guilty about not being able to do everything myself, and I hope it would give me more time to be present for my kids and my students. It's a delicate balance, but I'm willing to explore it if it means better care for my mom and less stress for me.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a sense of hope and willingness to explore solutions that could benefit both you and your mom. That's a great place to be.

Let's build on this momentum. I'd like to propose a plan for the next few sessions. We'll work together to involve your mom in the decision-making process, explore financial planning options, and discuss ways to balance her needs with your own emotional well-being and boundaries.

Before our next session, I want you to have an open and honest conversation with your mom about your concerns and ideas. It might be helpful to start with a conversation about what her needs are and what she's looking for in terms of care. You could say something like, "Mom, I want to make sure I'm doing what's best for you, and I'm considering some options for home health care. I want to involve you in this decision as much as possible. What are your thoughts on this?"

This conversation will help you understand her perspective and concerns, and it will also give you both a chance to explore potential solutions together. Are you feeling okay with having this conversation with your mom? Do you have any concerns or fears about how it might go?

Patient: I appreciate the plan, Nova. It does sound like a good approach. I'll try to have that conversation with my mom before our next session. I'm a bit nervous about it, but I think it's important to involve her in the decision-making process.

One concern I have is that she might feel defensive or upset if I bring up the idea of home health care. She's always been so independent, and I don't want her to feel like I'm taking away her control. I'll need to approach it carefully and make sure she knows that this is about supporting her, not taking over.

Do you have any tips on how to make that conversation go more smoothly? I want to be respectful and understanding, but also clear about the need for additional help.

Therapist: Marcus, I completely understand your concerns about having this conversation with your mom. It's natural to feel nervous, especially when discussing sensitive topics like her independence and care.

Firstly, it's great that you're approaching the conversation with empathy and understanding. Remember to focus on your mom's needs and feelings, rather than your own worries or concerns. Use "I" statements to express your thoughts and feelings, such as "I want to make sure you're getting the support you need" or "I'm worried about the impact of your condition on our daily life."

When discussing the idea of home health care, try to frame it as a collaborative effort to find a solution that works for both of you. You might say something like, "Mom, I want to explore some options to make it easier for us to take care of you. Would you be open to talking about what kind of support you think you might need?"

It's also essential to listen actively to your mom's perspective and concerns. Give her space to share her thoughts and feelings, and try not to interrupt or become defensive. Remember, this conversation is about finding a solution that works for both of you.

If your mom does feel defensive or upset, it's essential to acknowledge her emotions and validate her feelings. You can say something like, "I can see why you'd feel that way. I want to make sure you know that I'm coming from a place of love and concern for your well-being."

Lastly, be prepared to have a conversation that may not go as smoothly as you'd like. It's okay if you need to have multiple conversations or revisit the topic in the future. What's essential is that you're having an open and honest conversation with your mom, and that you're working together to find a solution that works for both of you.

How do you feel about having this conversation with your mom now? Do you have any other questions or concerns that might help you feel more prepared?
