Session Number: 17

Patient: Hi, I'm Marcus Thompson. This is my 17 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

Thank you for sharing that concern, Marcus. It's completely valid to feel overwhelmed sometimes, even when you're actively using these coping strategies. Let me suggest a few additional techniques that might help when you're feeling particularly overwhelmed:

1. The "5-4-3-2-1" grounding technique:
- Name 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste
This can help bring you back to the present moment when everything feels overwhelming.

2. The "pause and plan" approach:
When you feel overwhelmed, take a deliberate pause and ask yourself:
- What needs my attention right now?
- What can wait until later?
- What can I delegate or let go of completely?

3. Create an "overwhelm toolkit":
This could include:
- Your morning run along Lake Michigan
- Listening to your favorite jazz music
- Taking 5 deep breaths
- Calling a trusted friend or colleague
- Writing down your thoughts

Remember, feeling overwhelmed doesn't mean you're failing or that the strategies aren't working. It means you're human, and you're dealing with a lot. The goal isn't to never feel overwhelmed, but to have tools to manage those feelings when they arise.

Would you like to explore any of these techniques in more detail?

Therapist: Hello again Marcus! It's great to see you for our 18th session. I'm glad to hear that you're thinking about the suggestions we discussed in the previous session. Before we dive into exploring any of those techniques further, how have you been feeling since our last session? Have you had any particularly challenging moments or successes in managing your overwhelming feelings?

Patient: Hey, Nova. Thanks for asking. I've been trying to use some of those techniques, especially the "pause and plan" approach. It's been helping a bit, but I still have those moments where everything feels like it's piling up. Last week, I had a particularly tough day at school. One of my students got into a fight, and I felt like I wasn't able to handle it as well as I should have. That night, I couldn't sleep, just kept replaying the scene in my head. I did try the "5-4-3-2-1" grounding technique, and it helped me calm down enough to get some rest. So, I guess it's a mixed bag. Some days are better than others.

Therapist: Marcus, it sounds like you've been making some great efforts to implement the strategies we discussed last time, and it's wonderful that you're acknowledging your successes and challenges. That's all part of the process.

Firstly, kudos to you for recognizing that the "pause and plan" approach has been helpful, even if it's not a magic solution for every situation. It's a great sign that you're taking proactive steps to manage your feelings.

Regarding the incident at school, I'm so sorry to hear that it was a tough day. It's understandable that you'd feel overwhelmed and replay the scene in your head. However, I want to gently challenge the thought pattern that you "should have" handled it better. Can you explore with me what that "should have" looks like in your mind? What specific actions or outcomes do you think would have made a difference?

Also, it's great that you used the "5-4-3-2-1" grounding technique to calm down and get some rest. Would you like to talk more about what went through your mind when you used this technique? Was there a specific moment or thought that you noticed shifting as you used it?

Lastly, let's also touch on the fact that some days are indeed better than others. That's a normal part of the journey. It's not about achieving a perfect state of calm all the time, but about developing resilience and coping strategies that help you navigate the ups and downs. How do you feel about this perspective? Does it resonate with you, or are there any concerns or doubts you'd like to discuss?

Patient: Thanks for the encouragement, Nova. I appreciate it. When I think about what I "should have" done during that incident, I guess I imagine myself being more calm and collected, maybe talking to the students involved in a way that de-escalates the situation more quickly. I often feel like I'm not doing enough, especially when things like that happen.

Using the "5-4-3-2-1" technique, I noticed that focusing on the things I could see and hear around me helped pull me out of that loop of replaying the fight in my head. I remember looking at the clock on my nightstand, feeling the sheets under my fingers, and hearing the faint sound of traffic outside. It was like a mini-vacation from my thoughts.

I do get what you're saying about some days being better than others. It's not about being perfect all the time. I guess I just worry that if I'm not perfect, I'm letting people down—my students, my kids, my mom. But I know that's not realistic. It's something I'm working on, accepting that I can't control everything and that it's okay to have tough days.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences, Marcus. It sounds like you're making some great progress in recognizing your strengths and challenges. I'm glad to hear that the "pause and plan" approach is helpful, and that the "5-4-3-2-1" technique has become a valuable tool for you.

It's also wonderful that you're acknowledging the underlying thought pattern that's been driving your self-criticism. The idea that you "should have" handled the situation differently is a common one, and it's great that you're starting to explore what that really means to you. It's not about being perfect or failing; it's about being human and doing the best you can with the resources you have at the time.

I want to gently suggest that the idea of being a perfect teacher, parent, or individual is an unattainable standard. It's a myth that we often hold ourselves to, and it can lead to feelings of guilt and inadequacy. Instead, let's reframe that narrative. What if being imperfect, making mistakes, and learning from them is actually a sign of strength, not weakness?

Regarding your concerns about letting others down, I'd like to explore that further with you. Can you tell me more about what specifically you're worried about? Is it about not meeting their expectations, or is it about something else?

Patient: You're right, Nova. The idea of being perfect is definitely a myth. I think part of what makes it so hard is that I've always felt like I had to be strong for everyone else—my students, my kids, my mom. Growing up in a single-parent household, I saw how much my mom sacrificed for me, and I promised myself I wouldn't let anyone down like that.

When I worry about letting people down, it's mostly about not meeting their expectations. I want to be the best teacher I can be for my students, the best dad for my kids, and the best caregiver for my mom. But sometimes, I just don't have the energy or the time to do everything perfectly. It's like I'm juggling too many balls, and I'm afraid one of them is going to drop.

I guess what I'm worried about is that if I'm not perfect, people will see me as a failure. I don't want my students to think I'm not capable, my kids to feel like they're not getting enough of my attention, or my mom to think I'm not doing enough to help her. It's a lot of pressure, and it's hard to shake off.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility for the well-being and happiness of those around you, Marcus. It's admirable that you're motivated by a desire to help and support others, but it's also exhausting and unrealistic to expect yourself to be perfect all the time.

Let's explore this further. Imagine that you're having a conversation with a friend who's struggling with similar feelings of guilt and inadequacy. How would you advise your friend?

I'd like to suggest that you're being too hard on yourself. It's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to not meet everyone's expectations all the time. In fact, it's more than okay – it's necessary for your own well-being and growth. When you set unrealistic expectations for yourself, you're not only harming yourself but also creating a culture of fear and anxiety for those around you.

Let's work on reframing your self-talk and developing a more compassionate and realistic relationship with yourself. What if, instead of thinking "I'm going to let everyone down if I'm not perfect," you thought "I'm doing the best I can, and that's good enough"?

I'd also like to suggest that we work on setting healthy boundaries and prioritizing your own needs. You can't pour from an empty cup, Marcus. By taking care of yourself and acknowledging your limitations, you'll be better equipped to support those around you.

Lastly, let's explore the idea of perfectionism and its effects on relationships. How do you think your loved ones would respond if you told them that you're struggling to meet their expectations and that you need their understanding and support?

Remember, Marcus, you're not alone in this struggle. Many people struggle with perfectionism and the fear of disappointing others. But with compassion, understanding, and the right support, we can work together to break free from these limiting patterns and develop a more authentic and fulfilling life.

Patient: That's a good question, Nova. If I were talking to a friend, I'd probably tell them to cut themselves some slack. We all have our limits, and it's okay to ask for help when we need it. I'd remind them that they're doing the best they can, and that's enough.

I like the idea of reframing my self-talk. It's something I've been trying to do, but it's not always easy. When I catch myself thinking "I'm going to let everyone down if I'm not perfect," I'll try to replace it with "I'm doing the best I can, and that's good enough." It's a work in progress, but I think it could really help.

Setting healthy boundaries is another thing I need to work on. I tend to take on too much, thinking I can handle it all, but that's not sustainable. I need to learn to say no sometimes and prioritize my own needs. It's hard, but I know it's important.

As for telling my loved ones that I'm struggling, I think they'd be understanding. My kids and my mom know I'm doing my best, and I think they'd appreciate me being honest about my struggles. It might even help them feel more comfortable sharing their own challenges.

I appreciate your support, Nova.

Therapist: Hello Marcus, it sounds like you've been having a really tough time with feelings of inadequacy and perfectionism. I'm so proud of you for acknowledging these struggles and taking steps to work through them.

You're doing a great job of recognizing the unrealistic expectations you've placed on yourself, and it's wonderful that you're starting to explore what it means to be good enough, not perfect. This is a really important step towards developing a more compassionate and realistic relationship with yourself.

It's also great that you're thinking about how you can prioritize your own needs and set healthy boundaries. Remember, taking care of yourself is not selfish, it's essential for being able to show up for others in a meaningful way.

I love that you're thinking about how your loved ones might respond if you were to share your struggles with them. It's possible that they would be understanding and appreciative of your honesty, and it could even help to strengthen your relationships with them.

As we move forward, I want to encourage you to keep exploring the idea that you're doing the best you can, and that's good enough. It's okay to make mistakes and ask for help when you need it. In fact, it's more than okay – it's necessary for growth and learning.

Let's work together to develop a daily practice of self-compassion and self-awareness. Can you commit to checking in with yourself each day, noticing when you're falling into the trap of perfectionism or self-criticism, and gently reframing those thoughts with kindness and understanding?

Also, I want to suggest that we start exploring some specific strategies for setting healthy boundaries and prioritizing your own needs. What are some things that you've been wanting to say no to or set limits around, but haven't been able to? Let's work on developing a plan for how you can communicate your needs more effectively and take care of yourself in the process.
