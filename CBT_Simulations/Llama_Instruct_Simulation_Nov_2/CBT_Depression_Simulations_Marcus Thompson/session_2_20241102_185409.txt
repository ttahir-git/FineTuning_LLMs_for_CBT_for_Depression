Therapist: Hello again, Marcus. It's great to see you again in our 2nd CBT session. I'll start by asking how you feel about the progress we made in our last session. Can you tell me what's been on your mind lately, and how you've been feeling about the exercises and strategies we discussed?

Also, I'd like to ask: How would you rate your emotional distress level today, on a scale of 1-100?

Patient: Hey, Nova. It's good to be back. I've been thinking a lot about the exercises we talked about last time. The Responsibility Pie Chart really helped me see where I'm spreading myself too thin. I've been trying to break down my tasks more, and it's making a difference. I'm not feeling as overwhelmed as I was.

As for the daily reflection practice, I've been writing down three accomplishments each day. It's surprising how much that helps. I don't feel like such a failure when I see all the little things I'm getting done.

Emotional distress level today? I'd say it's around 65/100. It's still high, but it's an improvement from the 75 we talked about last time.

Therapist: Excellent progress, Marcus. It sounds like the Responsibility Pie Chart and daily reflection practice have been really helpful in reducing your feelings of overwhelm and guilt. It's also wonderful that you're acknowledging your small wins each day, which can really boost self-esteem.

Before we dive deeper, I want to acknowledge that a 10-point reduction in emotional distress is a significant improvement. That takes a lot of courage and effort. I'm proud of you for taking these steps and seeking support.

Now, I'd like to explore a bit further. You mentioned that the Responsibility Pie Chart has helped you see where you're spreading yourself too thin. Are there any areas where you feel like you're still struggling to set realistic boundaries or manage your responsibilities? Additionally, I'm curious to know more about how your mother's Alzheimer's diagnosis and co-parenting after divorce are still impacting you. How have you been feeling about those aspects of your life recently?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It means a lot to hear that. 

Yeah, there are still some areas where I'm struggling to set boundaries. Work is a big one. I keep taking on more projects and responsibilities at school because I feel like I have to. It's hard to say no when I see the need, especially with the kids.

As for my mom, it's been tough. Her condition is progressing, and I feel this constant pressure to be there for her. I spend most weekends at her place, trying to help out, but it's exhausting. I worry about her all the time, and I feel guilty when I can't be there.

Co-parenting with my ex-wife, Sarah, is another area where I'm struggling. We're trying to make it work, but it's complicated. I want to be there for my kids, but I also need to take care of myself. It's hard to balance everything.

So, yeah, those are the main areas where I'm still feeling the strain.

Therapist: It sounds like you're still carrying a heavy load, Marcus. It's great that you're acknowledging the areas where you're struggling to set realistic boundaries. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're feeling overwhelmed.

Let's break down each of these areas further. Starting with work, you mentioned taking on more projects and responsibilities because you feel like you have to. Can you tell me more about what's driving this need to take on more? Is it a desire to please others, a need for control, or something else?

Regarding your mom's Alzheimer's diagnosis, it's completely understandable that you feel a deep sense of responsibility and worry. Have you considered talking to your family about creating a support system to help share the caregiving responsibilities? This might include other family members, friends, or even hiring professional caregivers.

Lastly, co-parenting with Sarah can be challenging, especially when there are complicated emotions involved. Have you tried setting clear boundaries with Sarah regarding what you're comfortable with and what you're not? It might also be helpful to discuss your feelings and concerns with her, rather than trying to manage everything on your own.

I'd like to propose a thought experiment for you, Marcus. Let's imagine that you had unlimited resources and could hire a team of people to take care of everything on your list. What would you do with the time and energy that would be freed up? How would you prioritize your own needs and self-care in that scenario?

This can help us tap into your values and what's truly important to you, rather than just trying to manage the symptoms of burnout and overwhelm. What do you think?
