Therapist: Welcome back, Marcus! It's great to see you again. I'll start by reviewing the progress we've made so far, as outlined in your session summary. It's impressive to see how far you've come in just 18 sessions!

Before we dive into the present, I want to acknowledge and celebrate the progress you've made on setting boundaries and practicing time management. Using the "gray rock" approach and prioritizing tasks with the Eisenhower Matrix have been game-changers for you. I'm also delighted to hear that the grounding technique has been helpful for sleep and anxiety.

However, you've also mentioned that you're still struggling with perfectionism and being the "go-to" person. This is a common challenge many people face, and it's great that we're addressing it together. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been on your mind lately regarding these struggles? What specific situations or thoughts have been causing you distress?

Patient: Thanks for the acknowledgment, Nova. It's been a journey, for sure. The "gray rock" approach has been a bit of a revelation for me. It's helped me navigate some tricky situations at school and with my community work without feeling like I'm letting people down. The Eisenhower Matrix has also been a game-changer. I've been able to break down my tasks more effectively, which has reduced some of the overwhelm.

As for the perfectionism and being the "go-to" person, it's still a daily battle. Lately, I've been feeling the pressure especially when it comes to my teaching. I want to give my students the best, but sometimes I feel like I'm not doing enough, especially with the systemic issues they face. There's this constant voice in my head telling me I should be doing more, organizing more workshops, finding more resources. It's exhausting.

And then there's my mom. Her condition is progressing, and I feel this immense guilt that I can't be there for her as much as I want to. I'm trying to balance everything, but it feels like I'm constantly failing at something. The self-compassion exercise helped a bit, but the thoughts still creep in.

I guess what's been on my mind is this: Am I doing enough? Am I enough?

Therapist: Marcus, it sounds like you're carrying a heavy load, and it's no wonder you're feeling overwhelmed. The pressure to be perfect and meet everyone's expectations can be suffocating. It's interesting that you mention the voice in your head telling you that you should be doing more. Can we explore this voice further? What is it saying to you, exactly? Is it a specific phrase or sentence that's been repeating in your mind?

Also, I want to acknowledge that your concerns about not being there for your mom are valid. It's natural to feel guilty and worried about not being able to meet her needs. But I'd like to gently challenge this thought: "Am I doing enough?" Can we reframe this question together? Instead of focusing on whether you're doing enough, let's explore what's within your control and what you can realistically manage. Perhaps we can break down your responsibilities and tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks, just like we did with the Eisenhower Matrix.

Additionally, I want to remind you that you've made significant progress in recognizing the importance of self-care and setting boundaries. Remember, taking care of yourself doesn't mean you're being selfish; it means you're being responsible and kind to yourself. What do you think? Is there something specific you'd like to try or explore further to help shift your focus away from perfectionism and towards what's truly within your control?

Patient: That voice in my head, it's like a broken record. It keeps saying, "You should be doing more. You're not enough." It's relentless, especially when I'm trying to plan lessons or when I'm at my mom's place. It's like I'm constantly being judged, and I can't seem to silence it.

Reframing the question, "Am I doing enough?" is a good idea. I guess what I can control is how I approach each day and each task. Maybe instead of asking if I'm doing enough, I can ask, "What can I do today that will make a difference?" It's a subtle shift, but it might help me focus on what's within my reach.

Breaking down my responsibilities into smaller chunks sounds like a solid plan. I've been trying to do that with the Eisenhower Matrix, but I think I can be more intentional about it. Maybe I can start by listing out my top three priorities for each day and focusing on those.

As for shifting my focus away from perfectionism, I think I need to keep practicing self-compassion. The exercise you gave me last time helped, but I need to do it more consistently. Maybe I can set a reminder on my phone to take a few minutes each day to reflect on something positive I've done, even if it's small.
