Session Number: 15

Patient: Hi, I'm Marcus Thompson. This is my 15 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

Thank you for sharing those insights, Marcus. I can hear how deeply ingrained these patterns of thinking are, and how they're affecting multiple areas of your life. Let's try something together.

I'd like to introduce a concept called "the oxygen mask principle." You know how on airplanes they tell you to put your own oxygen mask on before helping others? This isn't selfish - it's necessary for survival and being able to help others effectively. How would it feel to apply this principle to your life?

Let's do a quick exercise. Imagine you're advising a close friend who's in your situation - someone who's trying to support their family, make a difference in their community, and be there for everyone. What would you tell them about taking time for self-care? Would you see them as selfish for needing to recharge?

This might help us start to challenge some of these deeply held beliefs about selfishness and responsibility. What are your thoughts on this?

Therapist: As a follow-up response, I'll assume the role of a CBT therapist and continue the conversation:

Marcus: I think it's really interesting to consider this from a different perspective. At first, it feels a bit weird to think about prioritizing my own needs over others. It's like, isn't that being selfish? But as I think about it more, I realize that it's not about being selfish, it's about being effective. If I don't take care of myself, I'm not going to be able to support others in the way I want to.

It's funny, because when I'm feeling burned out and exhausted, I often feel like I'm failing as a friend, partner, and family member. But what if I'm actually failing myself by not prioritizing my own well-being? That thought is kind of liberating, actually. I feel like it's giving me permission to take a step back and say, "You know what, I need some time for myself right now."

I can imagine advising a friend in this situation and telling them that taking time for self-care isn't selfish, it's necessary. In fact, I'd probably tell them that it's a sign of strength, not weakness. That by taking care of themselves, they're actually going to be able to be more present and supportive for everyone else in their life.

How does that sound? Am I on the right track here?
