Therapist: Welcome back to our session, Samantha! I'm glad to hear that we're at session 14. Before we dive into what we'll be working on today, let's take a moment to review your progress from session 13.

From our previous conversation, it sounds like you're making some good headway with reframing your business expectations, practicing gratitude, and breaking down communication strategies with Michael. You've also been recognizing the impact of perfectionism on your business decisions and acknowledging the importance of small steps towards positive interactions with your parents.

Before we move forward, I'd like to ask: what are your thoughts on the homework assignments I gave you last time? Which ones did you find most helpful or challenging? Was there anything that felt particularly difficult or overwhelming?

Also, what are some of the insights or realizations you've had since our last session? Have there been any moments where you felt like you made progress, or any moments where you felt stuck or frustrated?

Patient: Hi, Nova. Thanks for the welcome. I've been thinking a lot about the homework assignments, and I have to say, the self-compassion letter was really eye-opening. Writing it felt strange at first, almost like I was talking to a stranger, but by the end, I felt a bit more understanding towards myself. It was helpful to see my struggles from a different perspective.

The gratitude exercise was also surprisingly impactful. Listing three things each day that I'm grateful for has made me more aware of the small, positive moments in my day, like a good night's sleep or a supportive text from Michael.

However, the "good enough" concept in business decisions is still a struggle. I find myself redoing tasks multiple times, even when they're "good enough." It's hard to let go of that perfectionism, especially when I'm so invested in GreenThread's success.

I've had moments of progress, like when I managed to have a calm conversation with my parents about my business without getting defensive. But there are also days when I feel completely stuck, especially when sales are slow or when I miss a deadline. Those moments are really frustrating and make me question if I made the right decision to leave my corporate job.

Overall, I'm trying to be more patient with myself, but it's a work in progress.

Therapist: Samantha, it sounds like you've had some positive experiences with the homework assignments, especially the self-compassion letter and the gratitude exercise. That's wonderful to hear! It takes a lot of courage to write a self-compassion letter, and it's great that you're feeling more understanding towards yourself.

Regarding the "good enough" concept, it's not uncommon for people to struggle with letting go of perfectionism, especially when it comes to something as important as their business. It might be helpful to explore why you feel the need to redo tasks multiple times. Is it because you're worried that it won't be good enough, or is it because you're trying to control the outcome? Sometimes, perfectionism can be a way of trying to control the uncontrollable.

It's also great to hear that you had a calm conversation with your parents about your business. That's a significant step forward, and it shows that you're making progress with using "gray rock" responses.

Regarding the days when you feel stuck and frustrated, it's totally normal to have those moments. It's how you respond to them that matters. One thing that might be helpful is to try to catch those moments when you're feeling stuck and ask yourself, "What's the worst that could happen if I take a break and focus on something else?" or "What's the smallest step I can take right now to move forward?" Sometimes, taking a step back and re-evaluating our goals and expectations can help us feel more grounded and focused.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to question your decision to leave your corporate job. That's a big change, and it's natural to have doubts. But it's also great that you're recognizing that those doubts don't define your worth or your decision. Let's explore more about what's driving those doubts and see if we can work through them together.

What are your thoughts on this, Samantha? Is there anything that stands out to you, or anything you'd like to add?

Patient: Thanks for acknowledging that, Nova. It really helps to hear that it's normal to struggle with these things. I think you're right about perfectionism being a way to control the uncontrollable. With GreenThread, there's so much uncertainty, and I guess I'm trying to control what I can by making everything perfect. But it's exhausting, and it's not sustainable.

The idea of taking a break and focusing on something else when I feel stuck is something I'll definitely try. Sometimes, stepping back and re-evaluating can give me a fresh perspective. I've noticed that when I force myself to keep going, I end up feeling more overwhelmed and less productive.

As for questioning my decision to leave my corporate job, it's mostly about the financial stability and the pressure from my parents. They still see it as a reckless move, and their disapproval weighs heavily on me. I know they want the best for me, but their expectations are so high, and I feel like I'm constantly falling short.

I'd like to explore more about how to manage these doubts and the pressure from my parents. It's something that's been on my mind a lot lately, and I think it's affecting my overall well-being.

Therapist: Samantha, it sounds like you've made some excellent connections between your perfectionism and the desire to control the uncontrollable. Recognizing this pattern is a huge step forward, and it's great that you're willing to explore ways to let go of that need for perfection.

Regarding your doubts about leaving your corporate job, it's completely understandable that you're feeling pressure from your parents. It's like they're saying, "You're not good enough, and you've made a huge mistake by leaving your safe and secure job." That's a really tough message to receive, especially when you're already feeling uncertain and vulnerable.

Let's work on reframing their expectations and your own self-worth. Instead of seeing their disapproval as a reflection of your worth or your decision, let's try to reframe it as their own fear and uncertainty. They might be worried about your financial stability, but that's not because you're not capable or intelligent. It's because they're afraid of the unknown, and they're holding onto their own biases and expectations.

In terms of managing these doubts and the pressure from your parents, one strategy might be to create a support system of people who believe in you and your decisions. That could be friends, mentors, or even a therapist (wink). Having a community of people who support and encourage you can help counterbalance the negative voices in your life.

Another strategy might be to create a "pre-game" ritual for yourself when you're feeling anxious or uncertain. That could be something as simple as taking a few deep breaths, going for a walk, or doing a quick meditation. Having a consistent pre-game ritual can help you prepare for challenging situations and reduce your stress levels.

Lastly, let's work on developing a more compassionate and kind response to your parents' disapproval. Instead of internalizing their criticism and taking it as a personal attack, let's practice responding with empathy and understanding. You could say something like, "I understand that you're worried about my financial stability, but I'm doing my best to make this work. I appreciate your concern, but I need to trust my own abilities and decisions."

How do these suggestions sound, Samantha? Is there anything that resonates with you, or anything you'd like to add?

Patient: Those suggestions make a lot of sense, Nova. I think creating a support system of people who believe in me is really important. I've been isolating myself a bit, and it's made things worse. I have a few friends who are really supportive, and I should lean on them more.

The "pre-game" ritual idea is also something I can definitely try. I often feel anxious before meetings or when I have to talk to my parents, and having a consistent routine to calm myself down could be really helpful. Maybe I'll start with a quick meditation or a walk around the block before these situations.

As for responding to my parents with empathy and understanding, that's a tough one. I usually get defensive or shut down when they criticize my decisions. But I see how responding with empathy could help defuse the tension and maybe even open up a more constructive conversation. I'll try to practice that the next time we talk.

Overall, I feel like these strategies could really help me manage the pressure and doubts I'm dealing with. I'm ready to give them a try and see how they work for me.

How do you feel about these assignments, Samantha? Are there any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we wrap up our session?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate the summary and the specific homework assignments. It feels encouraging to see the progress we've made so far.

One thing that stood out to me was the idea of creating a support system. I've been hesitant to reach out to friends and mentors because I don't want to come across as needy or incompetent. Do you have any advice on how to approach this without feeling that way?

Also, I've been trying the pre-game ritual before important business meetings, and it's helped a bit, but I still find myself getting overwhelmed. Is there a more structured way to do this, or additional techniques I could try?

Lastly, I noticed you mentioned re-evaluating business goals and expectations. Can you give me an example of how to do that in a practical way? I often set big goals, but then feel paralyzed by the pressure to achieve them perfectly.

Therapist: As the AI CBT therapist, I'm glad you're excited about the progress we've made so far, Samantha.

Regarding creating a support system, it's great that you're willing to reach out to friends and mentors. One way to approach this without feeling needy or incompetent is to be clear about what you need and how they can support you. Instead of saying "I need your help," try saying "I'm feeling overwhelmed and would love to bounce some ideas off you. Can we grab coffee and talk about this?"

Regarding pre-game rituals, while there's no one-size-fits-all approach, you might find it helpful to try a combination of techniques. Here are a few ideas:

1. **Progressive muscle relaxation**: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting with your toes and moving up to your head.
2. **Mindfulness meditation**: Focus on the present moment, without judgment. You can use a guided meditation app or simply pay attention to your breath.
3. **Visualization**: Imagine yourself successfully navigating the challenging situation. Visualize yourself feeling calm, confident, and in control.
4. **Physical activity**: Engage in some light physical activity, like a short walk or some stretching exercises, to help release tension and increase energy.
5. **Grounding techniques**: Use your senses to ground yourself in the present moment. For example, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sounds around you, or the sensation of the air on your skin.

As for re-evaluating business goals and expectations, it's essential to make them more manageable and achievable. Here's an example of how to do that in a practical way:

1. **Break down big goals into smaller, actionable steps**: Instead of saying "I want to increase sales by 20% in the next quarter," try breaking it down into smaller goals, such as:
	* Research and identify new marketing channels
	* Create a content calendar to engage with customers
	* Develop a social media strategy to reach a wider audience
2. **Set realistic deadlines and milestones**: Instead of setting an unrealistic deadline, try setting smaller, achievable milestones. For example, instead of saying "I want to launch a new product by the end of the quarter," try setting a deadline of "I will complete the product development phase within the next two weeks."
3. **Focus on progress, not perfection**: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. Instead of striving for perfection, focus on making progress and improving your processes.

For homework, I'd like you to continue practicing self-compassion and gratitude exercises, reaching out to friends and mentors to create a support system, developing a pre-game ritual, and practicing responding with empathy to your parents' criticism.

Next week, we can work on re-evaluating and adjusting your business goals and expectations, and I'll provide more guidance on how to do that in a practical way.

How do.

Patient: Thank you for the detailed advice, Nova. I appreciate the specific strategies you've provided.

Regarding reaching out to friends and mentors, I'll try to be more clear about what I need and how they can support me. I think framing it as a collaborative discussion rather than asking for help will make it easier for me.

For the pre-game rituals, I'll experiment with a combination of techniques like progressive muscle relaxation and visualization. I think incorporating physical activity into my routine could also be beneficial.

As for re-evaluating business goals, breaking them down into smaller, actionable steps and setting realistic deadlines sounds like a practical approach. I'll start by focusing on progress rather than perfection and see how that helps.

I'm looking forward to our next session and working on these strategies. Thanks for your support, Nova.

Therapist: As the AI CBT therapist, I'm glad you found the advice helpful, Samantha. Remember, it's all about taking small steps and being kind to yourself as you work through these challenges.
