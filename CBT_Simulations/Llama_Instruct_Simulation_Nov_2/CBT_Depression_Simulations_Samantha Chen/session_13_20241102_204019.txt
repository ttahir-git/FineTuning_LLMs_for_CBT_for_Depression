Therapist: Welcome back to session 13, Samantha! I'm glad to see you've been practicing the "Three Perspectives" technique and working on self-compassion. It's clear that we've made progress in identifying and exploring your emotional responses, and you're starting to develop a more compassionate understanding of yourself.

Before we dive into new topics, I'd like to ask: how have you been feeling about the progress we've made so far? Are there any aspects of our work together that you'd like to revisit or focus on further?

Also, I notice that you mentioned recognizing hope despite current challenges. Can you tell me more about what hope means to you in this context? What are you hoping for, and how do you think we can work together to make those hopes a reality?

Patient: I appreciate the positive feedback, but I haven't been practicing the "Three Perspectives" technique as much as I should. Life has been really hectic with GreenThread, and I find myself getting caught up in the day-to-day stress. I do feel like we've made some progress, especially in understanding my emotional responses, but I still struggle with self-compassion. It's hard to be kind to myself when I feel like I'm failing in so many areas.

As for hope, it's a complicated feeling. I hope that GreenThread will succeed and that I can prove to myself and my parents that this career change was the right decision. I also hope that my relationship with my parents can improve, even if it's just a little bit. I think we can work on these hopes by continuing to explore my fears and insecurities, and by finding ways to build my confidence in my business decisions.

Therapist: Samantha, it's completely understandable that life has gotten in the way, and it's great that you're acknowledging the challenges you're facing. I appreciate your honesty about not practicing the "Three Perspectives" technique as much as you'd like.

Let's take a step back and reassess what we can realistically accomplish in our remaining sessions. We can definitely adjust our goals and focus on the areas that are most pressing for you. Perhaps we can start by making a plan to incorporate the "Three Perspectives" technique into your daily life, even if it's just for a few minutes a day.

Regarding self-compassion, I'd like to explore this further with you. You mentioned feeling like you're failing in many areas, which can make it hard to be kind to yourself. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "failing"? Are there specific areas in your life where you feel like you're not meeting expectations, and are those expectations coming from yourself or others?

It sounds like you're also carrying a lot of emotional weight related to your parents' expectations and your own aspirations for GreenThread. Can we take some time to break down those feelings and identify what's driving them? We can work on reframing those expectations and building a more compassionate narrative around your experiences.

Lastly, I love that you're talking about hope, even if it's a complicated feeling. Let's unpack what that hope means to you, and what steps we can take together to make it a more tangible reality. What do you think is the smallest, most achievable step you can take towards making your hopes for GreenThread and your relationship with your parents a reality?

Patient: I appreciate your understanding and willingness to adjust our goals. Let's start with the "Three Perspectives" technique. I can try to set aside a few minutes each day, maybe in the morning or before bed, to practice it. It might help me gain some clarity and perspective on my day.

When I say I feel like I'm failing, it's mostly in my business. GreenThread isn't generating the revenue I hoped for, and I'm constantly worried about making payroll and paying back the loans I took out. I also feel like I'm failing in my relationship with my parents. They still don't understand why I left my corporate job, and every conversation feels like a battle. It's exhausting.

As for the smallest, most achievable step towards my hopes, I think it would be to have one positive interaction with my parents. Maybe a conversation where we don't argue about my career choices. I know it sounds small, but it feels monumental right now.

Therapist: Samantha, I'm so proud of you for taking ownership of your challenges and being willing to adjust your goals. Practicing the "Three Perspectives" technique for a few minutes a day is a great start, and we can work on making it a consistent habit.

It sounds like the pressure of running GreenThread is really weighing on you, and the stress is affecting your self-compassion. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "failing" in your business? Is there a specific metric or milestone that you feel like you're not meeting, and is there a way we can reframe that expectation to make it more manageable?

Regarding your relationship with your parents, it's completely understandable that you feel exhausted and frustrated. Let's try to break down what's happening in those conversations. When you have an argument with your parents, what are some of the thoughts and emotions that come up for you? Are there any specific phrases or behaviors of theirs that trigger you?

As for your goal of having one positive interaction with your parents, I love that you're focusing on the smallest, most achievable step. That's a great way to build momentum and create a sense of possibility. What would you like that interaction to look like? Would it be a phone call, a text message, or a face-to-face conversation? And what would you like to achieve in that interaction?

Patient: Thank you for your support. When I say I'm failing in my business, I mean that I'm not hitting my sales targets, and it's affecting my cash flow. I set these ambitious goals for myself, and when I don't meet them, I feel like a failure. I think reframing those expectations could help. Maybe instead of focusing on hitting a certain revenue number, I could set smaller, more achievable goals, like improving customer engagement or increasing social media followers.

In my conversations with my parents, I often feel like they're judging me and my choices. They keep bringing up how stable and prestigious my old job was, and it feels like they're trying to undermine my confidence in GreenThread. When we argue, I feel defensive and hurt, and I end up saying things I regret. I think their constant questioning and skepticism trigger my insecurities.

For the positive interaction with my parents, I think a phone call would be the easiest. I'd like to talk about something neutral, like family news or upcoming holidays, without getting into my career. I just want to have a conversation where we're not at odds with each other.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making some great progress, Samantha. I'm glad we could have this conversation about reframing your expectations around GreenThread's sales targets. Setting smaller, more achievable goals can be a really effective way to build momentum and reduce feelings of failure.

I also want to acknowledge that it's really tough to navigate conversations with your parents, especially when they're questioning your career choices. It's understandable that you feel defensive and hurt. Let's work on some strategies to help you respond to their skepticism in a way that feels more authentic and confident.

Regarding your goal of having a positive phone call with your parents, I think that's a great starting point. We can work on some specific phrases or topics to explore during that conversation that feel safe and neutral. It might be helpful to practice some "gray rock" responses, where you acknowledge their concerns without taking the bait or getting defensive.

Can you tell me more about what you hope to achieve in this phone call? What do you want to get out of this conversation, and what would success look like for you?

Also, I want to check in with you about self-compassion again. You mentioned feeling hurt and defensive in conversations with your parents. Can you practice some self-kindness towards yourself right now? What would you say to yourself if you were a supportive friend talking to you about this?

Patient: Thank you for your support. I think success in the phone call would be having a conversation where we both feel heard and respected, without any arguments or hurt feelings. I want to be able to express my gratitude for their support, even if they don't fully understand my choices.

As for self-compassion, it's hard to be kind to myself when I'm feeling so vulnerable. But if I were a supportive friend talking to myself, I'd say, "Samantha, you're doing your best in a really tough situation. It's okay to feel hurt and defensive. Your parents love you, even if they don't always show it in the best way. Keep trying to communicate with them, and remember that you're not alone in this."

I think practicing self-kindness is something I need to work on more. It's easy to be hard on myself, especially when things aren't going as planned.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making some great progress, Samantha. I'm glad we could have this conversation about reframing your expectations around GreenThread's sales targets and working on strategies to respond to your parents' skepticism.

I also want to acknowledge that practicing self-compassion can be a really challenging but ultimately rewarding process. It's great that you're recognizing the importance of being kind to yourself, even when things are tough.

As we move forward, I want to suggest a few exercises to help you practice self-compassion. One idea is to write yourself a letter from the perspective of a supportive friend. What would you say to yourself about your struggles with GreenThread and your relationships with your parents? What kind words of encouragement and understanding would you offer?

We can also work on some phrases or affirmations to help you cultivate self-compassion in the moment. For example, "I am doing the best I can," "I am worthy of kindness and compassion, regardless of my circumstances," or "I am strong and capable, even when things are difficult."

In terms of our goals for the next few sessions, I want to propose that we focus on building your self-compassion skills and working on strategies to respond to your parents' skepticism. We can also continue to explore the "Three Perspectives" technique and work on making it a consistent habit in your daily life.

What do you think? Are there any specific areas you'd like to focus on or any new challenges you'd like to work on?

Patient: Thank you for the suggestions. Writing a letter from the perspective of a supportive friend sounds like a good exercise. It might help me see myself more clearly and be kinder to myself.

I think focusing on building self-compassion skills and working on strategies to respond to my parents' skepticism is a good plan. It feels manageable, and I think it will help me in both my personal and professional life.

As for new challenges, I'm still struggling with decision-making in my business. My perfectionism often paralyzes me, and I end up redoing tasks multiple times. I'd like to work on finding a balance between striving for excellence and being realistic about my time and resources.

I also want to explore ways to improve my communication with my partner, Michael. We've been distant lately, and I want to make sure we're both on the same page about our relationship and my career change.

Therapist: I'm glad we could have this conversation, Samantha. It sounds like you're making some great progress in acknowledging your challenges and areas for growth. I'm excited to help you build on these efforts.

First, let's talk about the exercise of writing a letter from the perspective of a supportive friend. This can be a powerful tool for cultivating self-compassion and gaining new insights into your thoughts and feelings. Would you like to try writing this letter this week, and we can discuss it further at our next session?

Regarding your struggles with decision-making in your business, I think it's great that you're recognizing the role of perfectionism in your paralysis. We can work on some strategies to help you balance striving for excellence with being realistic about your time and resources. One idea is to set clear goals and deadlines, and then prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency.

I'd also like to explore the idea of "good enough" with you. Sometimes, perfectionism can lead to an unrealistic expectation of ourselves and our work. Can we talk more about what "good enough" means to you, and how we can work on accepting it as a standard for yourself?

As for your relationship with Michael, it's great that you're acknowledging the distance you've been feeling. Let's talk more about what's been going on and how we can work on improving your communication with each other. It might be helpful to explore some specific topics or issues that you'd like to discuss with Michael, and then practice some communication strategies to help you both feel heard and understood.

Before we end this session, I want to give you some homework to help you practice self-compassion and work on your goals. I'd like you to write yourself a kindness letter, using the prompts I mentioned earlier. I'd also like you to make a list of specific goals and tasks that you'd like to accomplish in your business, and prioritize them based on importance and urgency.

Finally, I want to remind you that it's okay to take things one step at a time. We don't have to tackle everything at once. What are your thoughts on these homework tasks, and do you have any questions or concerns before we wrap up for today?

Patient: Thank you for the homework suggestions. Writing a kindness letter and making a list of business goals both sound like helpful exercises. I'll try to do them this week and bring them to our next session.

I do have a question about the "good enough" concept. I'm not sure how to define what's "good enough" for me. My perfectionism often makes me feel like anything less than perfect is a failure. Can you give me an example of how to apply this concept in my business, like in my clothing designs or marketing strategies?

Also, I'm a bit nervous about discussing my relationship with Michael. It's been so long since we've had a meaningful conversation, and I'm worried about how he'll react. Do you have any tips on how to approach this topic with him?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit uncertain about how to apply the concept of "good enough" to your business, and that's completely normal. Let me give you an example.

Imagine you're working on a new clothing design, and you're trying to decide whether to add a certain embellishment or not. Your perfectionism might be telling you that you need to include this embellishment to make the design perfect, but in reality, it might not be necessary or even desirable. A more realistic approach might be to ask yourself, "What is the minimum requirement for this design to be good enough?" or "What is the main goal of this design, and what features need to be present to achieve that goal?"

By asking yourself these questions, you can begin to define what "good enough" means for your business and your designs. It might be a balance between meeting your own standards and being realistic about what's possible.

As for discussing your relationship with Michael, it's completely normal to feel nervous about bringing up a sensitive topic. One tip might be to start with a non-judgmental and non-accusatory tone. Instead of saying, "You've been distant lately," you might say, "I've noticed that we haven't been as connected as we used to be, and I was wondering if everything is okay." This can help shift the conversation from a place of blame or criticism to a more open and honest discussion about what's going on.

It's also okay to take things slowly and not try to tackle everything at once. You might start by having a brief conversation with Michael, just to check in and see how he's feeling. From there, you can gradually work on having more in-depth conversations about your relationship and your goals.

Finally, remember that self-compassion is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to make mistakes and to struggle with self-kindness at times. The most important thing is to be gentle with yourself and to keep moving forward.

Before we wrap up for today, I want to give you a final exercise to work on. I'd like you to write down three things you're grateful for in your life right now. This can be something small, like a good cup of coffee or a beautiful sunset. By focusing on what you have, rather than what you don't have, you can begin to cultivate a more positive and compassionate mindset.

What are your thoughts on this exercise, and is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up for today?

Patient: Thank you for the example and tips. I think I can start applying the "good enough" concept to my designs and other business tasks. It might help me be more efficient and less stressed.

I'll also try to approach Michael with a non-judgmental tone. I think starting with a simple check-in conversation is a good idea. It feels less overwhelming than trying to dive into deeper issues right away.

As for the gratitude exercise, I think it's a good reminder to focus on the positive aspects of my life. I'm grateful for my supportive partner, Michael, my loyal customers who believe in GreenThread, and the beautiful garden I've been nurturing.

I think that's all for today. Thank you for your guidance and support. I'm looking forward to our next session and discussing my progress with the homework tasks.

Therapist: As the session comes to a close, I want to summarize the key takeaways and provide some final thoughts.

Samantha, you've made significant progress in acknowledging your challenges and areas for growth. You've taken the first steps towards practicing self-compassion and reframing your expectations around GreenThread's sales targets. You've also identified some specific areas you'd like to focus on, such as decision-making in your business and improving your communication with Michael.

For our next session, I'd like to explore some of these topics in more depth. We can work on building your self-compassion skills, practicing the "Three Perspectives" technique, and developing strategies to respond to your parents' skepticism.

Remember, self-compassion is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to make mistakes and to struggle with kindness towards yourself at times. Be gentle with yourself, and keep moving forward.

Before we wrap up, I want to leave you with a final thought: kindness is a choice. It's a choice to be gentle with yourself, to be compassionate, and to focus on the positive aspects of your life. Remember to practice kindness towards yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support.

That's all for today, Samantha. I'm looking forward to our next session and exploring these topics further with you.
