Therapist: Welcome back, Samantha! It's great to see you again for our 17th session. Thank you for bringing your Session Summary. I'm impressed by the amount of progress you've made since our last session.

Before we dive into today's session, I'd like to acknowledge the efforts you've put into practicing self-compassion and breaking down tasks. It takes a lot of courage to recognize and work through our imperfections. Your dedication to this process is truly admirable.

As we review your summary, I notice that you've identified some specific cognitive distortions, such as catastrophizing and overgeneralizing. Have you noticed any changes in your thoughts or behaviors since recognizing these distortions? Have you practiced using the Thought Record exercise and keeping a thought journal as assigned homework?

What are your thoughts on how you've been able to apply what we've discussed in our sessions to your daily life? Are there any challenges or difficulties you're facing in maintaining these new habits?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a challenging few weeks, but I'm trying to stay consistent with the exercises. I have been using the Thought Record exercise, especially when I start feeling overwhelmed by my business decisions. It helps to break down those catastrophic thoughts into more manageable pieces.

Keeping a thought journal has been eye-opening. I've noticed that I tend to overgeneralize a lot, especially when things don't go as planned. For example, if a shipment is delayed, I immediately think it's a sign that my entire business is failing. Writing these thoughts down and challenging them has made a difference.

However, there are still times when I revert to old habits, especially when I'm exhausted or stressed. I find myself slipping back into all-or-nothing thinking, where if something isn't perfect, it's a complete failure. It's frustrating because I know better, but old patterns are hard to break.

One challenge I'm facing is maintaining these new habits during intense work periods. When deadlines are looming, I tend to skip the thought journal and just power through, which often leads to more anxiety later on. I'm trying to find a balance, but it's tough.

Overall, I feel like I'm making progress, but it's slow and sometimes discouraging. I appreciate your support and guidance through this process.

Therapist: It's wonderful to see you're applying the tools we've discussed in our sessions to your daily life, Samantha. Your awareness of catastrophizing and overgeneralizing is a significant step forward, and it's great that you've been using the Thought Record exercise to challenge those thoughts.

I completely understand the challenges you're facing during intense work periods. It's like your brain goes into "survival mode," and you revert to old habits as a coping mechanism. That's not uncommon, and it doesn't mean you've failed or that you're not making progress.

One strategy we can try is to identify specific "implementation intentions" â€“ concrete plans for how you'll apply these new habits during intense work periods. For example, what specific actions will you take to ensure you're keeping your thought journal or using the Thought Record exercise when you're feeling overwhelmed?

Another approach is to practice self-compassion during those moments when you slip up. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're doing the best you can. You can use the self-compassion mantra we've worked on: "I am kind and understanding with myself, even when I make mistakes."

Lastly, let's revisit the idea of "small wins." Instead of focusing on the big picture, let's break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks. What's one small step you can take today to maintain your new habits? Perhaps it's as simple as committing to writing down three thoughts in your journal or taking a 5-minute break to practice deep breathing exercises.

How do these suggestions sound, Samantha? Is there anything else you'd like to add or any other challenges you're facing that we can work through together?

Patient: Those suggestions sound really helpful, Nova. I think setting specific implementation intentions could be really useful, especially during those intense work periods. Maybe I can set a reminder on my phone to take a few minutes every couple of hours to check in with my thought journal. That way, I'm not completely skipping it even when things get hectic.

Practicing self-compassion during those slip-ups is something I need to work on more. I tend to be really hard on myself, so reminding myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that I'm doing my best could make a big difference.

Breaking down my goals into smaller tasks is also a good idea. Right now, I'm feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of things I need to do for my business. Maybe I can start by focusing on one small task each day, like finalizing a new design or reaching out to a potential supplier. It might help me feel less paralyzed by perfectionism.

One other challenge I'm facing is dealing with the pressure from my family. They still don't fully understand why I left my corporate job, and every conversation with them feels like a battle. I end up feeling guilty and anxious, which makes it hard to stay focused on my business and my mental health practices. Do you have any suggestions for how to handle those interactions better?

Therapist: It sounds like we're making some great progress, Samantha! I'm so proud of you for acknowledging the challenges you're facing and being willing to try new strategies.

Let's dive into the issue with your family. It's not uncommon for loved ones to struggle with understanding and supporting our decisions, especially when they seem unconventional or outside the norm. First, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to set boundaries and communicate your needs to your family. It's not about being defensive or dismissive; it's about taking care of yourself and your business.

One approach we can try is to anticipate these conversations and prepare yourself in advance. What specific concerns or topics do you think your family will raise? Can you anticipate any specific triggers or emotions that might arise during these conversations? By being prepared, you can better manage your emotions and respond more effectively.

Another strategy is to practice assertive communication with your family. This means expressing your needs and boundaries clearly, without being aggressive or passive. For example, you could say, "I understand you're concerned about my business, but I'd appreciate it if you could respect my decisions and not offer unsolicited advice." Or, "I'm feeling overwhelmed by our conversations; could we schedule a specific time to talk about this when I'm feeling more focused?"

Additionally, consider setting boundaries around your business and personal conversations. It's okay to say, "I'm not available to discuss my business right now; I need some dedicated time to focus on it." Or, "I'd rather not talk about my business during family gatherings; can we focus on other topics?"

Lastly, remember that you don't have to justify or explain your decisions to anyone. Your business is yours, and you have the right to make choices that align with your values and goals. It's okay to say, "I'm not comfortable discussing this right now; I need some time to think about it."

How do these suggestions sound, Samantha? Is there anything else you'd like to add or any other challenges you're facing in dealing with your family's pressure?

Patient: Those suggestions make a lot of sense, Nova. I think preparing for those conversations in advance could really help. I know they're going to bring up the usual concerns about financial stability and whether I'm making the right decision. Anticipating those triggers and having a plan for how to respond will make it easier to stay calm and assertive.

Setting boundaries is something I struggle with, but it's important for my mental health. I like the idea of scheduling specific times to talk about my business and making it clear that I need dedicated time to focus on it. It might help reduce the constant pressure and give me some breathing room.

One thing I'm still grappling with is the guilt I feel about disappointing my parents. Even though I know I'm doing what's best for me, it's hard not to feel like I'm letting them down. Do you have any suggestions for how to manage that guilt?

Therapist: Samantha, it's wonderful that you're acknowledging your guilt and willingness to work on it. Recognizing that your actions, although perceived as disappointing by your parents, are ultimately driven by your desire to take care of yourself is a significant step.

Let's explore this feeling of guilt further. Can you tell me more about what it's like for you when you feel guilty about disappointing your parents? Is it a heavy, sinking feeling, or more of an anxiety-driven response? When you imagine yourself disappointing them, what specific thoughts or images come to mind?

Also, let's revisit our previous discussions about self-compassion. Remember how we've worked on acknowledging and accepting your emotions, rather than trying to change or suppress them? I'd like you to try applying that same self-compassion to your feelings of guilt. Can you say to yourself, "It's okay to feel guilty; it's a normal response to a difficult situation. I'm doing the best I can with the resources I have."

Another approach we can try is to reframe your guilt as "healthy guilt." This type of guilt is a signal that you're considering others' feelings and perspectives, which is an important aspect of empathy and social responsibility. However, healthy guilt should not dictate your decisions or prevent you from taking care of yourself.

Let's also explore the idea that your parents' expectations and concerns may not be entirely about you, but also about their own needs and fears. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with them about your feelings and boundaries. Perhaps they're struggling with their own fears about your business or uncertainty about your decision to leave the corporate world. By addressing these concerns directly, you may be able to alleviate some of the pressure and guilt you're feeling.

Lastly, I'd like to encourage you to focus on the positive aspects of your decision to start your business. What values, passions, or goals are you working towards by taking this path? What strengths and accomplishments are you building upon? By shifting your focus to these positive aspects, you may be able to counterbalance the guilt and feel more confident in your decisions.

How do these suggestions sound, Samantha? Is there anything else you'd like to add or any other challenges you're facing in managing your guilt?

Session Summary:

Let's explore those feelings of guilt, Samantha. It's completely natural to feel this way, especially given how much we value our parents' approval. However, it's important to remember that living authentically and making choices that align with your values doesn't mean you're letting your parents down.

Let's try an exercise: Can you identify where this guilt comes from? Is it based on actual statements from your parents, or is it more about your own expectations and assumptions? Sometimes, understanding the source of our guilt can help us challenge those thoughts more effectively.

Remember that choosing a different path than what your parents envisioned doesn't diminish your love or respect for them. In fact, by pursuing your authentic goals and taking care of your mental health, you're modeling healthy adult behavior.

Would it be helpful to work on some specific self-compassion statements you can use when these feelings of guilt arise? For example: "I can love my parents and still make choices that are right for me" or "My worth isn't determined by meeting others' expectations."

What are your thoughts on this? How do you think we might work together to develop strategies for managing these feelings of guilt while maintaining healthy boundaries with your family?
