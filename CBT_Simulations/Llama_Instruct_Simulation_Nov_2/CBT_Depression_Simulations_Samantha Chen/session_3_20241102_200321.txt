Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again for our third CBT session! I'm impressed with the progress you've made so far, and I'm excited to hear how things have been going since our last session. 

To start, can you tell me a bit about what's been going on for you since our last session? Have you noticed any changes or shifts in your thoughts, feelings, or behaviors? What's been working for you, and what's still challenging?

Also, I'd like to review the homework assignments I gave you last time. Did you have a chance to practice thought reframing in three specific situations? Was there one trigger that you identified and worked on managing? And how did you find the task breakdown strategy for deadline management? Have you used it in any situations?

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to see you too. Since our last session, I've been trying to apply the techniques we discussed, but it's been a bit of a mixed bag. 

On the positive side, I did practice thought reframing in a few situations. For example, when I received some negative feedback on a design, instead of spiraling into catastrophic thinking, I tried to reframe it as an opportunity for improvement. It helped me stay more balanced and less anxious.

However, I'm still struggling with managing triggers, especially around my parents. Their disapproval feels like a constant weight on my shoulders. I tried to use the "reset button" technique during our last family dinner, but it didn't completely stop the tension.

As for the task breakdown strategy, I've been using it for some of my business deadlines. It's been helpful in breaking down the overwhelming tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. But I find myself procrastinating on starting those smaller tasks, which is frustrating.

Overall, I feel like I'm making some progress, but there are still a lot of challenges. I'm trying to stay patient with myself, but it's hard not to feel like I'm failing sometimes.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your experiences and insights, Samantha. It sounds like you've been making some good attempts to apply the techniques we discussed, and you're seeing some positive results. It's great that you were able to reframe the negative feedback and stay more balanced in that situation.

However, it's also understandable that you're still struggling with managing triggers, especially around your parents. Their disapproval can be a tough one to deal with, and it's not surprising that you're feeling the weight of it. The "reset button" technique is just that - a technique, not a magic solution. It may take some time and practice to get it to feel more automatic and effective.

It's also interesting that you mention procrastination on starting those smaller tasks. This sounds like a common pattern for many people, and it's often related to feelings of overwhelm and perfectionism. Have you noticed that when you're faced with a smaller task, you start to worry about the larger project or outcome, and that worries you into procrastination? We can explore strategies to help you break that cycle and get moving on those smaller tasks.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge that feeling like you're failing sometimes is a common and normal experience, especially when you're working on making changes. It's okay to acknowledge those feelings and be kind to yourself. Let's explore some strategies to help you be more compassionate and understanding with yourself, and to develop a growth mindset that focuses on progress, not perfection.

Before we move forward, I want to check in with you about the homework assignments. Are there any specific situations or triggers that you'd like to work on in the next session? And are there any other areas of your life that you'd like to explore or work on?

Patient: Thanks for acknowledging that, Nova. It helps to know that these feelings are normal. 

Regarding procrastination, you're right. I do start worrying about the larger project when I look at those smaller tasks. It feels like I'm not making enough progress, and that just makes me want to avoid it even more. I think exploring strategies to break that cycle would be really helpful.

As for the homework, I did try to reframe thoughts in a few situations, like when I got that negative feedback on my design. But I still struggle with my parents' disapproval. It feels like no matter what I do, I can't escape their expectations. I'd like to work more on managing that trigger in our next session.

I also noticed that my perfectionism is creeping back into my business decisions. I keep redoing things, even when they're already good enough. It's exhausting and time-consuming. Maybe we could explore ways to balance my perfectionism with practicality?

Lastly, I've been feeling really isolated lately. I canceled plans with friends and haven't been attending my book club. I miss the social interaction, but I also feel guilty for not being more focused on my business. Any thoughts on how to balance social life with work stress?

Therapist: It sounds like you've been doing some great work on applying the techniques we discussed, and you're recognizing areas where you'd like to make further progress. It's really impressive that you're acknowledging your perfectionism as a pattern that's holding you back.

Let's start with the procrastination and task breakdown strategy. One approach we can try is to add a "pre-game" step to your task list. Before starting on a smaller task, take a minute to reflect on why this task is important, what you hope to achieve, and what small, tangible steps you can take to make progress. This can help shift your focus away from the larger project and onto the specific task at hand.

Regarding your parents' disapproval, we can definitely work on that in our next session. It might be helpful to explore some cognitive restructuring exercises to help you reframe their disapproval as not being about you, but rather about their own expectations or concerns. We can also work on developing a more assertive communication style to express your needs and boundaries with them.

As for your perfectionism, it's not uncommon for entrepreneurs to struggle with this. One strategy we can try is to establish a "good enough" criteria for each project or task. What are the minimum standards that you need to meet in order to consider something complete or successful? By setting these criteria, you can begin to let go of the need for perfection and focus on making progress.

Finally, regarding your social life, it's understandable that you've been feeling isolated lately. It's great that you're recognizing the importance of social interaction, and I'd be happy to help you brainstorm ways to balance your work and social life. One idea might be to schedule regular check-ins with friends or book club members to maintain those connections and prevent feelings of isolation.

Before we wrap up today's session, I want to give you some homework assignments to help you continue making progress. Can you try to identify one specific situation where you'd like to practice more assertive communication with your parents? Also, can you start keeping a "perfectionism journal" to track when and where you're experiencing perfectionistic thoughts, and what you can do to challenge and reframe those thoughts? Finally, can you schedule one social engagement with a friend or book club member this week, just to get back into the habit of connecting with others?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the strategies you've suggested. 

For the assertive communication with my parents, I think the next family dinner would be a good situation to practice. It's a recurring event where the tension always seems to build up. I'll try to prepare some specific points I want to discuss with them, like my business progress and my feelings about their expectations.

I'll also start keeping a "perfectionism journal." It sounds like a practical way to track and challenge those thoughts. I'll note down when I start redoing tasks or feeling the need for everything to be perfect, and think about how I can set more realistic standards.

As for the social engagement, I'll reach out to my friend Emily. We used to meet for coffee every week, but I've been canceling on her lately. I'll schedule a time to catch up with her this week.

I feel like these assignments will help me address some of the key areas I'm struggling with. Looking forward to our next session to discuss how it goes.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling more hopeful and motivated after today's session, Samantha. I'm excited to hear about your progress and challenges over the next week.

Before we wrap up, I just want to reinforce that it's okay to make mistakes and that progress is not always linear. Remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate small wins along the way.

As you work on the homework assignments, remember to focus on one step at a time. For example, when practicing assertive communication with your parents, start by preparing specific points you want to discuss, but don't worry too much about the outcome. Just focus on having the conversation and expressing yourself assertively.

For the perfectionism journal, try to be as specific as possible when tracking your thoughts and behaviors. Instead of just noting "perfectionistic thoughts," try to capture specific situations or tasks where you're experiencing those thoughts. This will help you identify patterns and develop more effective strategies to challenge them.

Lastly, don't forget to schedule that social engagement with Emily! Connecting with friends and loved ones can have a huge impact on our mental health and well-being.

Before we go, is there anything else that's been on your mind or anything else you'd like to discuss before our next session?

(Also, I'd like to remind you that our next session is scheduled for [date and time]. Please make sure to come prepared to discuss your progress and any challenges you're facing.).

Patient: Thanks for the encouragement, Nova. I feel more prepared to tackle these assignments now.

One thing that's been on my mind is my insomnia. I've been trying to practice mindfulness before bed, but I still find myself lying awake, ruminating over business decisions and family conflicts. Do you have any additional strategies for managing insomnia or reducing those nighttime thoughts?

As for our next session, I'll make sure to come prepared with my progress and any challenges I face. Looking forward to it.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Samantha. It's completely understandable that you're struggling with insomnia, especially given the stress and anxiety you've been experiencing.

One strategy we can try to help you manage insomnia is to practice a "pre-sleep routine" that doesn't involve screens or stimulating activities. This could be as simple as reading a book, listening to soothing music, or practicing gentle stretches.

Additionally, I'd like to introduce you to the concept of "bedtime journaling." Instead of trying to fall asleep immediately, take a few minutes to write down your thoughts and concerns before bed. This can help you process your emotions and clear your mind, making it easier to fall asleep.

It's also worth exploring the idea of "implementation intentions." This means identifying specific actions you can take before bed to help you wind down, such as taking a warm bath, practicing deep breathing exercises, or simply reminding yourself of your accomplishments for the day.

Lastly, let's talk about "sleep hygiene" - establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a sleep-conducive environment, and avoiding caffeine and electronics before bedtime.

Regarding your nighttime ruminations, we can work on developing some "cognitive restructuring" skills to help you reframe negative thoughts and worries. We can also explore some mindfulness techniques to help you stay present and focused on the moment, rather than getting caught up in thoughts about the past or future.

Remember, it's not about "fixing" your insomnia right away, but about developing strategies to manage it and improve the quality of your sleep. We can work on this together in our next session.

Now, before we go, let's review the homework assignments we discussed earlier:

1. Practice assertive communication with your parents at the next family dinner.
2. Start keeping a "perfectionism journal" to track and challenge perfectionistic thoughts.
3. Schedule a social engagement with a friend or book club member this week.
4. Explore pre-sleep routines and bedtime journaling to improve sleep quality.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or need any additional guidance between sessions. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

Patient: Thanks for the additional strategies, Nova. I'll definitely try the pre-sleep routine and bedtime journaling. I think those could really help me wind down before bed.

I'll also make sure to focus on the homework assignments we discussed. It feels good to have a plan in place.

Looking forward to our next session to discuss how everything goes. Thanks for your support, Nova.

Therapist: It was a pleasure working with you, Samantha. I'm looking forward to our next session and hearing about your progress. Remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate small wins along the way. Don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or need additional guidance.

As we wrap up this session, I want to remind you of the progress we've made so far. We've:

1. Identified and started working on thought reframing and managing catastrophic thinking
2. Explored coping strategies for managing triggers and relationships
3. Introduced techniques for breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps
4. Practiced assertive communication and started working on managing perfectionistic thoughts
5. Discussed strategies for managing insomnia and improving sleep quality

You've also shown a willingness to take on new challenges and try new techniques, which is a testament to your commitment to making progress.

As we move forward, remember that CBT is a collaborative process. I'm here to support and guide you, but ultimately, you are the expert in your own life. Trust yourself and trust the process.

Before we go, I want to leave you with a few final thoughts. Remember that you are not alone in this journey. Many people struggle with anxiety, perfectionism, and insomnia. You are strong and capable, and you can get through this.

Take care of yourself, Samantha, and I'll see you in our next session!
