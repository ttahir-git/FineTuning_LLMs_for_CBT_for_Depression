Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again for Session 15. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever feel that you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted support person. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like facial expressions or body language. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hey, Nova. Yeah, I've been okay, I guess. Still trying to get those walks in, but it's tough. The pain's been pretty bad lately. And I did try that breathing thing you mentioned, but it's hard to focus on it when everything else is hurting. How about you? Anything new on your end?

Therapist: I appreciate you sharing about the challenges with walking and the pain you've been experiencing. It takes a lot of strength to keep pushing through despite these difficulties. Before we talk more about that, I'm curious if there's been any changes in your emotional state since our last session. Have you had any more conversations with Emma about how you've been feeling, or have there been any other significant interactions that have impacted your mood?

Patient: Well, I did talk to Emma again. She's been trying to check in more often, which is nice, but it's also tough. I don't want to be a burden to her, you know? She's got her own life and problems. As for other stuff, not much has changed. Still feeling pretty down most days. The pain just keeps dragging me down.

Therapist: It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy burden, Derek. It's understandable that you feel concerned about burdening Emma, but it's important to remember that she cares about you and wants to support you. Let's make sure we prioritize discussing your emotional state today. What else would you like to focus on in our session?

Patient: I guess I'm just trying to figure out how to handle all this pain and keep my head above water. It's hard to stay positive when everything feels like it's falling apart. I'm not sure what else to talk about, really. Just need some way to cope with all this.

Therapist: I hear you, Derek. It's incredibly challenging to cope with chronic pain and the emotional toll it takes. We'll definitely focus on strategies to help manage your pain and improve your overall well-being. I'd also like to spend some time exploring how your thoughts and beliefs might be influencing your emotions and behavior. We can work on reframing negative thought patterns and finding ways to honor your strengths and resilience. Does that sound okay to you?

Patient: Yeah, that sounds okay. I guess I'm open to trying anything that might help. Just tell me what you need me to do, and I'll give it a shot.

Therapist: Let's start by setting a clear agenda for our session today. We'll prioritize discussing your emotional state and exploring how your thoughts and beliefs might be impacting your pain and overall well-being. We'll also focus on developing coping strategies to help you manage your chronic pain and maintain a sense of positivity. How does that sound to you, Derek?

Patient: Alright, that sounds like a plan. Let's get started. I'm ready to talk about whatever you think will help.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing what you've been going through, Derek. I want to make sure we have a good understanding of your current emotional state and the challenges you're facing. Can you tell me more about how your pain has been affecting you lately?

Patient: It's been pretty rough, to be honest. The pain's constant, and it's hard to do anything without it flaring up. I can't even enjoy my woodworking or fishing like I used to. It's like everything I loved is just slipping away.

Therapist: It's understandable how losing those activities that bring you joy could impact your emotional well-being. Let's explore how you've been feeling about this loss and the thoughts that come up around it. Can you share more about what goes through your mind when you think about not being able to do the things you love?

Patient: It's frustrating, you know? I used to be good at what I did, and now I can't even pick up a hammer without feeling like I'm falling apart. It's like I'm losing a part of myself, and that's hard to accept.

Therapist: That sounds like a significant loss, both physically and emotionally. Let's take a moment to acknowledge the grief and frustration you're feeling. Losing the ability to engage in activities that have brought you joy and purpose is a meaningful loss, and it's okay to take time to mourn that.

Patient: Yeah, it's tough. I never thought I'd be in this position, not being able to do the things that made me feel like myself. It's like I'm just drifting, and I don't know how to stop it.

Therapist: Drifting is a difficult experience, and it's common when dealing with significant changes in our lives and abilities. I wonder if we could explore how your thoughts and beliefs might be influencing this feeling of drifting. For example, have you noticed any negative thought patterns that come up when you think about your current situation?

Patient: Well, I guess I tend to think that I'm just a burden now. I can't work, I can't do the things I used to, and it feels like I'm just taking up space. It's hard not to feel like a failure when everything I knew is gone.

Therapist: Those thoughts about being a burden and a failure can be incredibly heavy and unhelpful. It's important to recognize that they are thoughts, not necessarily facts. We can work on reframing those thoughts and finding more balanced, compassionate ways of thinking about your situation.

Patient: I get what you're saying, but it's hard to shake those thoughts. They feel real, you know? Like they're just the truth of the matter. How do you suggest I start reframing them?

Therapist: One way to start reframing those thoughts is to look for evidence that contradicts them. For example, when you say you're a burden, is there evidence that supports that belief? Or is there evidence that you're more than that?

Patient: Well, I guess my kids still check in on me, even though I know I've been distant. And I do try to help out around the apartment when I can, even if it's just little things. But it's hard to see those as anything more than just trying to get by.

Therapist: That's a great example of evidence that contradicts the belief that you're a burden. The fact that your kids still reach out and the efforts you make to help out, even in small ways, suggest that you're not just a burden. We can work on recognizing and valuing these parts of yourself as we continue to reframe those negative thoughts.

Patient: I see what you're getting for, but it still feels like a stretch. I guess I just need to keep reminding myself of those things, even if it doesn't feel natural right now.

Therapist: It's completely understandable that this feels like a stretch right now. Reframing negative thoughts is a skill that takes practice, and it's not always easy, especially when the thoughts are deeply ingrained. The key is to be patient and compassionate with yourself as you work on this.

Let's try another technique to help you challenge those negative thoughts about being a burden. I'd like you to imagine that a close friend was in your situation, struggling with pain and feeling a loss of purpose. What would you say to that friend?

Patient: If a friend was in my shoes, I'd tell them that they're still valuable, even if they can't do everything they used to. I'd remind them that they've got a lot of life experience and that they're still important to the people who care about them. It's just hard to believe that for myself, you know?

Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Derek. It's often easier to show compassion to others than to ourselves, but recognizing that your friend would deserve that compassion can help you start to extend that same compassion to yourself. As we continue to work on reframing negative thoughts, we'll practice applying that same level of understanding and kindness to yourself.

Another way to challenge negative thoughts is to consider the impact they have on your emotions and behavior. When you think "I'm just a burden," how does that thought make you feel and what do you feel like doing in that moment?

Patient: When I think that I'm just a burden, it makes me feel pretty low, like there's no point in even trying. It makes me want to withdraw even more, avoid people, and just sit around feeling sorry for myself. It's like the thought just sucks the energy right out of me.

Therapist: That's a really important connection, Derek. The thought "I'm just a burden" leads to feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, which then influence your behavior, causing you to withdraw and avoid activities that might actually help improve your mood. This is a great example of how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected.

By recognizing this connection, we can start to interrupt that cycle. When you notice thoughts like "I'm just a burden," you can pause, acknowledge the thought, and then challenge it using the techniques we've been practicing, like looking for evidence against the thought or considering how you'd respond to a friend in a similar situation.

This is where the behavioral activation we've been working on becomes so important. Even though you might not feel like doing things, by pushing yourself to engage in meaningful activities anyway, you can start to disrupt that cycle of negative thoughts and withdrawal. It's about taking small steps and building momentum over time.

Patient: I get what you're saying about breaking the cycle. It's just hard to get started sometimes. But I'll try to remember to challenge those thoughts when they come up and push myself to do a bit more, even if it feels like a struggle.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have, Derek. Remember, it's okay if it feels like a struggle at first. The key is to keep practicing, be patient with yourself, and celebrate those small victories along the way.

I'd like to explore how this cycle of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors might be impacting your relationship with your family. You mentioned earlier that you've been feeling like a burden to Emma. Can you tell me more about how this thought and these feelings have been showing up in your interactions with her?

Patient: Well, I guess I've been avoiding calls and texts from Emma because I feel like I'm just a drain on her. I know she's trying to help, but I feel like I'm just bringing her down too. So, I end up not reaching out, and then I feel even worse about myself.

Therapist: That's a great observation, Derek. It sounds like that thought "I'm just a burden" is really impacting your relationships and communication with Emma. By avoiding her, you're cutting yourself off from potential sources of support and connection, which can then reinforce those feelings of isolation and worthlessness.

This is a good opportunity to practice some of the reframing techniques we've been working on. Let's challenge the thought "I'm just a burden" in the context of your relationship with Emma. What evidence do you have that supports that thought?

Patient: Well, I guess the main evidence is that I can't do the things I used to, like helping her with home repairs or just being there for her in the same way. And I feel like I'm always asking for help, whether it's financial or just emotional support.

Therapist: Okay, so that's one piece of evidence that supports the thought. Now let's look for evidence that contradicts it. Have there been times when you've been able to contribute to your relationship with Emma, even in small ways?

Patient: I suppose there was that time I gave her some advice about her job. She was having a tough time with her boss, and I was able to help her figure out a way to handle it. She seemed really grateful for that.

Therapist: That's a great example of evidence against the thought that you're just a burden. You were able to offer valuable support and guidance to Emma, even with your limitations. That's something to be proud of, Derek.

Another way to challenge this thought is to consider the impact you have on Emma, even if it's not as tangible or visible as when you used to do repairs or heavy lifting. What are some ways that Emma might feel supported or connected to you, even if you're not doing everything you used to?

Patient: I guess she appreciates that I'm still around, even if I can't do the physical stuff anymore. She knows I care about her and her family, and I think she values that.

Therapist: Absolutely. Your presence, your love, and your emotional support can have a big impact, even if it's not in the same way as before. It's about shifting the lens to focus on the things you can do, rather than dwelling on the things you can't do.

As we wrap up today, I want to leave you with this idea of shifting the lens. When you find yourself getting caught up in negative thoughts, like "I'm just a burden," try to pause and consciously shift your focus to the evidence that contradicts that thought. Look for the small ways you are still contributing and the positive impact you are still having, even in the midst of your limitations.

Patient: Alright, I'll try to remember that. It's not always easy to see the good when things are tough, but I'll give it a shot. Thanks, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I know it's not easy, but you're doing great work. Remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself as you practice these skills. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need support. I'm here for you.

For homework, I'd like you to keep practicing those reframing techniques we've been working on. When you notice those negative thoughts about being a burden or feeling like a failure, take a moment to pause, challenge those thoughts, and look for evidence against them. At the same time, keep up with the walking and breathing exercises we've discussed, and try to find a few small ways to connect with Emma or your other loved ones this week.

I look forward to hearing how it goes when we meet again. How are you feeling as we wrap up today?
