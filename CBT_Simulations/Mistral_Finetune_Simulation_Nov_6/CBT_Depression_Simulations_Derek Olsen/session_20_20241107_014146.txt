The session showed progress in Derek's willingness to challenge his negative thoughts about receiving help and take small steps toward re-engaging with activities he previously enjoyed.

Therapist: Derek, it's great to see you today. Before we dive into the session, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and emotions openly through your messages.

With that said, let's start by checking in on how you've been doing since our last session. How have you been feeling, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?

Patient: Thanks for the heads-up. I get it, you're not perfect. I've been feeling about the same, just trying to get by. I did set up my woodworking tools like you suggested, but I haven't actually done anything with them yet. It's been hard to get motivated. Other than that, not much has changed. Still dealing with the pain and trying to avoid asking for help.

Therapist: I understand that it can be challenging to find motivation, especially when dealing with pain and depressive symptoms. Let's make sure to discuss strategies for getting started with your woodworking hobby later in our session. For now, I'd like to set an agenda for today. Based on what you've shared so far, it seems like it might be helpful to:

1. Explore your thoughts and feelings around asking for help, particularly in relation to your recent experience with your neighbor Pete.
2. Discuss strategies for getting started with your woodworking hobby and managing the associated anxiety or negative thoughts.
3. Review your experience with the Thought Record technique and explore any other concerns or challenges that have come up since our last session.

Does this agenda sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?

Patient: Yeah, that agenda sounds okay. I guess we can start with the woodworking stuff. I'm still not sure how to get started without feeling like I'm just wasting time. And I'm still a bit uneasy about asking for help, even after talking to Pete. It's like I keep thinking people will judge me or think I'm weak.

Therapist: I appreciate you sharing that. Let's start by exploring those thoughts and feelings more deeply. When you think about asking for help with your woodworking, what specific thoughts come to mind? And how do those thoughts make you feel?

Patient: When I think about asking for help with the woodworking, I get this knot in my stomach. I keep thinking, "What if I mess up and waste all this time and materials?" Or, "What if people see me struggling and think I'm not capable anymore?" It makes me feel anxious and embarrassed, like I'm not good enough.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing those thoughts and feelings, Derek. I can understand how those thoughts would lead to feelings of anxiety and embarrassment. Let's take a closer look at one of those thoughts using the Thought Record technique we've practiced before.

Can you identify the situation that triggers this thought, and the emotions it leads to? Then, we can work on finding evidence for and against the thought, and come up with a more balanced perspective.

For example, the situation might be "Trying to start woodworking project," and the emotions might be anxiety and embarrassment. Does that sound right?

Patient: Yeah, that sounds about right. The situation is definitely trying to start a woodworking project. The emotions are anxiety and embarrassment. I guess the thought is, "I'll mess up and waste time and materials."

Therapist: Great job identifying the situation and emotions. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea you'll mess up and waste time and materials?

Patient: Well, I haven't done any woodworking in a while, so I'm a bit rusty. And with my back, I'm not as strong or steady as I used to be. So, there's a good chance I might mess up.

Therapist: Okay, that's good evidence for the thought. Now, let's look at evidence against the thought. Have there been times in the past when you've successfully completed woodworking projects without messing up?

Patient: Yeah, there have been times when I've completed projects without any major issues. I used to build furniture and cabinets all the time. I guess I just need to remind myself that I still have the skills, even if it's been a while.

Therapist: Absolutely! That's great evidence against the thought. You've successfully completed woodworking projects in the past, which suggests that you have the skills and ability to do it now, even if it feels challenging at first.

Now, let's look at the thought "What if people see me struggling and think I'm not capable anymore?" What evidence do you have for and against this thought?

Patient: For the thought, I guess I worry that people will see me struggling and think I'm not as good as I used to be. It's like they'll judge me for needing help. Against the thought, I know that Pete offered to help, and he didn't seem to think any less of me. He just wanted to support me.

Therapist: That's a great point, Derek. So, it seems like there's evidence on both sides of the thought, but there's also evidence that contradicts the idea that people will judge you for needing help.

Let's come up with a more balanced thought based on this evidence. What might be a more helpful way to view the situation?

Patient: Maybe a more balanced thought could be, "It's okay to need help sometimes, and people who care about me will support me without judging." That way, I don't feel so anxious about asking for help.

Therapist: That's a fantastic balanced thought, Derek! It acknowledges the reality that you may need help sometimes, but also recognizes that people who care about you will support you without judgment. This thought can help reduce feelings of anxiety and embarrassment when asking for help with your woodworking projects.

Now, let's discuss how you can apply this balanced thought to your behavior. What might you do differently when you start feeling anxious or embarrassed about asking for help?

Patient: I guess I could remind myself of that balanced thought and take a deep breath before asking for help. Maybe even start with smaller projects to build my confidence back up.

Therapist: That's a great idea! Taking a moment to remind yourself of the balanced thought and focusing on your breath can help you feel more grounded and prepared to ask for help. Starting with smaller projects is also a wonderful way to build confidence and momentum.

Another strategy we can use to help you feel more comfortable asking for help is role reversal. Let's pretend that you and I are in the situation where you need help with your woodworking projects. What might I say to you to help you feel more comfortable and confident?

I can give you some examples if that might be helpful.

Patient: Yeah, examples would be helpful. I'm not really good at imagining these things.

Therapist: Okay, let's try it. Imagine that you're at the beginning of a woodworking project, and you're feeling a bit anxious or embarrassed about asking for help. What might I say to you in that situation?

Example 1: "It's great that you're taking on this project. Remember, it's okay to need help sometimes. I'm here to support you."
Example 2: "You've successfully completed woodworking projects before, and you have the skills to do it again. It might feel a bit challenging at first, but that's okay. Let's break the project down into smaller steps and focus on one at a time."
Example 3: "I'm not an expert on your specific project, but I'm here to listen and offer support. If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask me for help. I'm confident you can figure it out."

What do you think about those examples? Do any of them resonate with you or help you feel more comfortable asking for help?

Patient: Example 2 feels the most real to me. It's like you're reminding me that I've done this before and it's okay to take it slow. That could help me feel less anxious about asking for help.

Therapist: I'm glad Example 2 resonates with you, Derek. It's wonderful that you're able to recognize the relevance of those words to your own situation. As we continue to work on challenging the negative thoughts around asking for help, it can be helpful to remember this example and practice reminding yourself of your past successes.

Now, let's shift gears a bit and discuss how you can apply this new perspective to taking the first steps with your woodworking projects. Can you tell me about a small step you could take this week to re-engage with this hobby?

Patient: I could start by organizing my tools and cleaning up the workspace. That way, when I feel ready to start a small project, everything is in order and I won't feel so overwhelmed.

Therapist: That's a fantastic first step, Derek! Organizing and cleaning your tools and workspace is a great way to ease into your woodworking projects. It can help you feel more prepared and in control.

As you work on organizing, consider incorporating mindfulness practices. Take a moment to notice your breath, and be present with the task at hand. This can help reduce feelings of anxiety and increase your focus on the present moment.

After you've completed organizing, what do you think might be a reasonable first project to take on? Remember to break it down into smaller steps and practice talking to yourself in a kind, supportive way throughout the process.

Patient: A reasonable first project could be something simple, like building a small birdhouse. It's not too complicated, and it would give me a sense of accomplishment without feeling too overwhelmed.

Therapist: Building a small birdhouse is a great idea, Derek! It's a manageable project that can give you a sense of accomplishment while helping you reconnect with your woodworking skills.

As you work on your birdhouse, pay attention to any negative thoughts that may arise, such as "I'm not good at this anymore" or "I should be able to do this faster." Remember to challenge these thoughts using the techniques we've discussed, like examining evidence and generating alternative perspectives.

For example, if you notice yourself thinking, "I'm not good at this anymore," you could remind yourself of past projects you've completed successfully. Or, if you think, "I should be able to do this faster," you could acknowledge that it's okay to take your time and focus on enjoying the process, rather than rushing.

How do you feel about incorporating these techniques as you work on your birdhouse this week?

Patient: I think it's worth a try. I'll keep an eye on those negative thoughts and remind myself that it's okay to take my time. Maybe I'll even jot down some of those balanced thoughts to keep handy while I work.

Therapist: That's an excellent idea, Derek! Writing down your balanced thoughts can be a helpful reminder to challenge negative thoughts as they arise. You can even create a small sign for your workspace, with phrases like "I am capable and competent" or "I am learning and growing."

Remember, the goal is not to get rid of negative thoughts altogether, but rather to develop a more balanced and compassionate perspective. It's okay if negative thoughts come up; the important part is how you respond to them.

As you work on your birdhouse and practice these techniques, pay attention to how you feel. Notice any shifts in your emotions or sense of accomplishment. We can discuss your experience in our next session.

For now, let's take a moment to review what we've covered today. We explored your thoughts and feelings around asking for help with your woodworking projects, and we discussed how you can use the Thought Record technique to challenge negative thoughts.

We also developed a balanced thought to replace the anxious or embarrassed thoughts that might arise when asking for help, and you practiced applying this balanced thought to a specific situation. We then discussed strategies for taking the first steps with your woodworking projects, including breaking tasks down into smaller steps and incorporating mindfulness practices.

For homework, I'd like you to continue practicing the Thought Record technique whenever you notice anxious or embarrassed thoughts around asking for help. Write down the situation, the emotions that arise, the negative thoughts that come up, and the evidence for and against those thoughts.

Then, come up with a more balanced thought based on the evidence, and write down how that new thought affects your emotions. Finally, put your balanced thoughts in a place where you can easily see them when working on your woodworking projects.

Does this sound like a manageable homework task? Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework or anything else we've discussed today?

Patient: Yeah, that sounds manageable. I'll give it a shot. No questions right now, but if anything comes up, I'll let you know next time.

Therapist: That sounds great, Derek. I'm here to support you, and I'm confident that you can make progress with these techniques. Remember, it's okay to take it slow and be kind to yourself along the way.

Before we end today's session, let's do a quick check-in on your current mood. How are you feeling right now?

Patient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful, I guess. It's nice to think about getting back into woodworking, even if it's just a small step.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that, Derek. That sense of hope and the willingness to take small steps is so important. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and there may be ups and downs along the way. But by consistently practicing these techniques and being kind to yourself, you can make meaningful changes in your life.

Thank you for your hard work and openness in today's session. I'm excited to hear about your experiences with the Thought Record technique and your woodworking projects in our next session.

Until then, take care of yourself and remember that you can always reach out if you need support. You're doing a great job, Derek.
