Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again for our 8th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interactions are text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues.

With that said, I'm here to support you in navigating your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors using CBT techniques. Our previous sessions have focused on exploring your experiences with gender identity, family relationships, cultural background, and academic stress. Today, I'd like to propose that we continue our work in these areas while also addressing any new challenges or insights that have arisen since our last session.

What are your thoughts on this plan, Naomi? Is there anything specific you'd like to add to our agenda for today's session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. I think continuing to work on those areas makes sense. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the time management plan and stress management techniques you suggested. It's been a bit of a mixed bag.

On the positive side, I've noticed that breaking down my assignments into smaller steps has helped me feel less overwhelmed. I've also been making a conscious effort to take regular breaks, which has been good for my mental health. However, I've had a few challenging conversations with my parents about my gender identity, and I'm not sure if I'm using the "Opposite Action" technique effectively.

I'd like to focus on how to better navigate those conversations with my parents today. It's been really tough, and I could use some guidance on how to approach it in a way that feels authentic to me but also takes their cultural background into account.

Therapist: Navigating conversations with family members can be incredibly challenging, especially when cultural factors are at play. It's great that you've been working on implementing the stress management techniques we discussed, like time management and taking breaks. The fact that you're recognizing the challenges you've faced in conversations with your parents is an important insight.

Before we dive deeper into that topic, let's take a moment to check in on your overall mood and any other experiences or changes you've noticed since our last session. How would you describe your current emotional state, and have there been any other significant events or changes in your life since we last met?

Patient: My emotional state has been pretty up and down lately. There are days when I feel really motivated and connected with my studies and activism, but then there are others where I feel completely overwhelmed and disconnected from everything. I think the academic stress is still a big factor, especially with some recent deadlines and exams. I've also had a few tough conversations with my parents. They found some of my poetry online and read it aloud to family members without my permission, which felt like a violation of my privacy. That really upset me and made me question if I should keep sharing parts of myself with them.

Therapist: It sounds like you've been navigating a lot of complex emotions lately, Naomi. The incident with your parents and their reaction to your poetry is a significant event that can certainly contribute to those feelings of disconnection and distress. It's understandable that you might question whether to continue sharing parts of yourself with them, given how that experience made you feel.

Given the emotional turbulence you've been experiencing, I think it could be helpful to spend some time in today's session exploring those feelings more deeply and perhaps work on developing some coping strategies to help you manage the ups and downs. We can also look at how your thoughts and beliefs might be influencing your feelings and behaviors in these situations.

In addition to the emotional turbulence and the challenges with your parents, are there any other topics or concerns you'd like to prioritize for today's session?

Patient: I think it would be helpful to explore those feelings more deeply. The incident with my parents really shook me, and I've been feeling a lot of guilt and confusion about it. I want to understand why it affected me so much and how I can move forward without feeling like I'm betraying myself or my parents.

I also want to talk about how I can better manage my academic stress. Even though I've been trying to implement the time management techniques, I still find myself procrastinating sometimes, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if there's a deeper issue at play.

Therapist: It sounds like you're grappling with some complex emotions and challenges, Naomi. I appreciate your willingness to share them with me today. Let's start by exploring the emotions that came up for you when your parents read your poetry aloud without your permission. Can you walk me through the different thoughts and feelings that you experienced in that moment?

Patient: When my parents read my poetry aloud, I felt a mix of anger, hurt, and betrayal. I had written those poems as a way to express my inner thoughts and feelings, and I didn't expect them to be shared with others without my consent. It felt like they were dismissing my privacy and autonomy. I also felt a sense of guilt because I know they were trying to understand me, but it just felt like they were trying too hard and not respecting my boundaries. It made me question if I should continue sharing parts of myself with them, which is something I've been struggling with for a while now.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing those emotions and the thoughts that accompanied them, Naomi. I can see how that experience would bring up feelings of betrayal, guilt, and questioning your sense of self. Let's explore these thoughts and feelings a bit more deeply. When you think about sharing your poetry with your parents, what other thoughts come to mind?

Patient: When I think about sharing my poetry with my parents, I feel a mix of hope and fear. On one hand, I want them to understand the depth of my feelings and the struggles I face. But on the other hand, I'm terrified that they might misinterpret my words or react negatively, just like they did this time. It makes me question if our relationship is strong enough to handle such personal and emotional discussions.

Therapist: It's interesting how those conflicting thoughts and feelings can coexist, creating a sense of uncertainty and anxiety. On the one hand, you have the desire to connect with your parents on a deeper level and share your inner world with them. But on the other hand, the fear of rejection, misunderstanding, and the painful memories of the recent incident keep you from fully embracing that desire.

Let's explore this further. When you think about your parents' reaction to your poetry, what do you think it says about your relationship with them?

Patient: I think it says that our relationship is complicated and that there's a lot of work to be done. On one hand, they care about me and want to understand me, but on the other hand, they don't always respect my boundaries or understand my perspective. It makes me feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells, trying to balance my need for their acceptance with my need for self-expression.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Naomi. The conflict between wanting to maintain your parents' acceptance and staying true to your own sense of self is a common challenge for many people. It's not uncommon to feel like you're navigating a tightrope, trying to balance these opposing needs.

Given this conflict, let's look at how this situation affects your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. When you feel like you're walking on eggshells in your relationship with your parents, what thoughts tend to arise?

Patient: When I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, I often think that I need to be careful about what I say or share with them. I worry that if I express my true feelings, they might react negatively or misunderstand me. This makes me feel anxious and guarded, and I end up holding back parts of myself. It's exhausting and makes me feel disconnected from them.

Therapist: It sounds like the situation with your parents is triggering thoughts of fear and anxiety, leading to feelings of being guarded and disconnected. This is an important realization, Naomi, because it allows us to see how your thoughts are influencing your emotions and behaviors.

Let's take this a step further. When you think about your parents' reaction to your poetry, what behaviors or actions might they be expecting from you?

Patient: I think they might be expecting me to conform to their expectations and values, even if it means suppressing parts of my identity. They might want me to be more traditional and less vocal about my non-binary identity and my feelings. It feels like they're trying to mold me into someone who fits their idea of what a good daughter should be.

Therapist: It's understandable that you feel a sense of pressure from your parents to conform to their expectations, even if it means suppressing parts of your authentic self. This brings up another important concept in CBT: the notion of "shoulds" and "musts." These are rigid, perfectionistic thoughts that can create pressure and anxiety, such as the belief that you "should" be a certain way or that you "must" meet others' expectations.

Let's explore this further. Can you identify any "shoulds" or "musts" that might be influencing your thoughts and feelings in this situation with your parents?

Patient: I think one of the "shoulds" that I have is that I should be able to make my parents understand and accept me completely. I feel like I must be perfect and flawless in their eyes, even if it means hiding parts of myself. This pressure makes me feel like I'm constantly failing, because no matter what I do, I can't seem to bridge that gap between us.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It's a common struggle to feel like we "should" or "must" be perfect and meet others' expectations, even at the cost of our own authenticity. These types of thoughts can create a lot of pressure and anxiety, making it difficult to navigate relationships and express ourselves fully.

In CBT, we work on challenging these perfectionistic thoughts and developing more balanced, self-compassionate ways of thinking. One way to do this is by examining the evidence for and against these thoughts.

Can you think of any evidence that supports the idea that you should be able to make your parents understand and accept you completely, or that you must be flawless in their eyes?

Patient: Well, I think the evidence that supports that idea is that I want to have a close and loving relationship with my parents, and I believe that understanding and acceptance are key to that. I also feel like I owe it to them to be the best version of myself, because they've invested so much in my upbringing and education. But on the other hand, I know that they have their own beliefs and values that are deeply ingrained, and it might take time for them to fully understand and accept me.

Therapist: That's a great point, Naomi. On one hand, you have the desire for a close and loving relationship with your parents, and the belief that understanding and acceptance are important aspects of that. On the other hand, you recognize that it might take time and effort on everyone's part to bridge the gaps in understanding and that it's not entirely within your control.

This is where the concept of "shoulds" and "musts" can be challenging. They can create unrealistic expectations and make us feel responsible for things that are beyond our control. Let's look at this further. Can you think of any downsides to having these rigid expectations for yourself and your relationship with your parents?

Patient: One downside is that it puts a lot of pressure on me to be perfect and to meet their expectations, which can be exhausting and overwhelming. It also makes me feel like I'm constantly failing, because I can't control how they react or what they understand. This pressure can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression, and it makes it harder for me to be authentic and true to myself.

Therapist: You raise a great point, Naomi. Holding oneself to unrealistic standards and putting pressure on yourself to meet others' expectations can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and a sense of constant failure. It can also make it difficult to be true to yourself and express your authentic identity, which is an important aspect of self-care and overall well-being.

Another downside to rigid expectations is that they can create conflicts and misunderstandings in relationships. When we expect others to think, feel, and behave a certain way, we might overlook their perspectives and experiences, which can lead to resentment and distance in the long run.

Given these challenges, what do you think might be a more balanced and self-compassionate way of thinking about your relationship with your parents?

Patient: I think a more balanced way of thinking about my relationship with my parents could be to recognize that my parents, like most people, are doing the best they can with the knowledge and experiences they have. They might not understand my identity right away, but that doesn't mean they don't love me or care about me. It might take time for them to come around and accept me fully, and that's okay. I can focus on being patient with them and with myself, and continue to create spaces where I can be my authentic self, even if it's not always around them.

Therapist: That's a wonderful insight, Naomi. Recognizing that everyone is doing the best they can with the knowledge and experiences they have, and that it might take time for others to understand and accept us fully, can create more space for self-compassion and understanding.

Focusing on being patient with others, but also with ourselves, is a great way to create balance and manage the pressure of expectations. It's also important to create spaces where you can be your authentic self, which includes surrounding yourself with people and communities that support and accept you.

As we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in recognizing and challenging some of the unrealistic expectations and perfectionistic thoughts that have been impacting your relationship with your parents and your overall well-being.

In our next session, we can continue to explore these themes and work on developing more balanced and self-compassionate ways of thinking. We can also look at how you can communicate your needs effectively with your parents and set healthy boundaries, both with them and in other relationships.

For homework, I'd like you to continue practicing the time management techniques we've discussed, such as breaking tasks into smaller steps and taking regular breaks. I also encourage you to challenge any "shoulds" or "musts" that come up in your thoughts and to practice self-compassion when you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious.

Finally, I'd like you to try to have a conversation with one of your friends or community members about your thoughts and feelings related to your family and your identity, and practice listening to their perspectives with an open mind.

Do you have any questions or thoughts about what we've discussed today, or anything you'd like to add?

Patient: I think I'm feeling a bit more hopeful about the situation with my parents after today's session. I'll definitely try to practice more self-compassion and patience, and I'll work on breaking down my tasks to manage my academic stress better. I'm also looking forward to having that conversation with a friend to get some outside perspective. Thanks, Nova.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful, Naomi. I'm glad that our discussion has provided some clarity and tools to work with. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. Be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.
