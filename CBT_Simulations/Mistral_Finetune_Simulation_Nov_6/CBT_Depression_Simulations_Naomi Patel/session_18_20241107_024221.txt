Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. It's always helpful to start by reviewing what we discussed last time and the progress we've made so far. Before we dive into today's agenda, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I strive to provide the best support possible, there are some things I'm not capable of, such as accessing real-time information beyond what you share with me during our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I provide may not be entirely accurate, as I rely on the inputs you give me. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever find yourself in a position where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like facial expressions or body language. Despite these limitations, I'm committed to working with you to the best of my abilities and supporting you on your journey towards better mental health and well-being. With that said, let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or significant events in your life that you'd like to discuss?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. On one hand, I've been making more of an effort to schedule self-care activities, like going for walks and cooking vegetarian meals, which has helped me feel more grounded. On the other hand, I had a tough conversation with my parents about my identity. They still struggle to understand, but I tried using the "I" statements we discussed. It was hard, but I felt a bit more in control of the conversation. 

Academically, I'm still struggling with deadlines and concentration. I had a major paper due last week, and I ended up pulling an all-nighter, which left me feeling drained for days. I'm trying to balance everything, but it's overwhelming at times. 

I also attended a climate change protest over the weekend, which was both energizing and exhausting. It's important work, but it takes a lot out of me. 

Overall, I'm trying to stay positive and keep up with the self-care practices, but it's a constant battle. How do you suggest I handle the academic pressure better?

Therapist: Naomi, I'm glad to hear that you've been making an effort to schedule self-care activities and that you're feeling more grounded. It's also great that you applied the "I" statements during your conversation with your parents. It shows that you're taking steps to advocate for yourself and your needs. Balancing academic pressures with self-care can be challenging, especially when deadlines are looming. Let's explore some strategies to help you manage this balance better.

One strategy we can discuss is time management. This involves breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps and creating a schedule that allows for dedicated study time as well as self-care activities. Another strategy is to practice self-compassion when you're feeling overwhelmed. Remember that it's okay to take breaks and that you're doing the best you can in a challenging situation.

What are your thoughts on these strategies? Do you have any other concerns or challenges you'd like to discuss today?

Patient: Time management sounds like a good idea. I've tried breaking down tasks before, but I often feel like I'm not doing enough, even when I'm working on smaller tasks. I guess I need to be more forgiving of myself when I take breaks. 

I also wanted to talk about the protest I attended. It was really impactful, but I felt so drained afterward. I want to stay involved in activism, but I'm not sure how to balance it with everything else. Do you have any tips for managing that kind of emotional energy?

Therapist: Naomi, you raise a valid point about feeling like you're not doing enough, even when you're working on smaller tasks. This is a common challenge, and it's important to remember that taking breaks and practicing self-compassion is a crucial part of the process. When we're too hard on ourselves, it can lead to burnout and decreased productivity.

One way to combat this feeling is to focus on progress, not perfection. Break down your tasks into smaller steps, and celebrate each accomplishment, no matter how small it may seem. This can help you maintain motivation and prevent self-criticism from taking over.

Regarding the protest, it sounds like it was a meaningful experience, even if it left you feeling drained afterward. Activism can be emotionally taxing, but it's also incredibly important work. It's essential to find a balance that allows you to engage in causes you care about without neglecting your other responsibilities.

What do you think about setting boundaries around your activism involvement? This could involve limiting the frequency or duration of events you attend, or finding ways to stay involved without taking on too much. It's also important to be mindful of self-care before, during, and after engaging in activism.

Patient: Setting boundaries sounds like a good idea. I think I need to be more mindful of how much I take on and make sure I'm not overcommitting myself. Maybe I could limit the number of events I attend each month and make sure I have time to recharge afterward. 

I also want to talk about the self-harm I mentioned in my background. I've been trying to avoid it, but sometimes it feels like the only way to cope with overwhelming emotions. I'm scared that if I don't find other ways to deal with stress, I might slip back into that behavior. Do you have any suggestions for alternative coping mechanisms?

Therapist: Naomi, I appreciate your willingness to discuss your struggles with self-harm. It's a common coping mechanism for many people, but as you know, it's not a healthy long-term solution. I'm glad to hear that you've been trying to avoid it and find other ways to cope.

Let's explore some alternative coping mechanisms that might be helpful for you. One strategy is to practice mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. These can help you manage overwhelming emotions in the moment without resorting to self-harm.

Another strategy is to engage in activities that give you a sense of accomplishment or enjoyment, like creative pursuits or physical exercise. This can help shift your focus away from distressing thoughts and emotions and provide a sense of mastery or pleasure.

It's also important to have a plan in place for when you're feeling overwhelmed. This could include reaching out to a trusted friend or family member, calling a crisis hotline, or engaging in self-care activities like taking a warm bath or listening to calming music.

What are your thoughts on these strategies? Do you have any concerns or questions about implementing them?

Patient: Mindfulness and relaxation techniques sound like they could be helpful. I've tried deep breathing before, but I sometimes find it hard to focus on it when I'm really stressed. Maybe I need to practice it more regularly so it becomes more natural. 

Engaging in creative activities is something I enjoy, like writing poetry or cooking. I could definitely make more time for those when I'm feeling overwhelmed. 

Having a plan for when I'm feeling overwhelmed is a good idea too. I think I need to be more proactive about reaching out to my support network when I'm struggling. I often isolate myself when I'm feeling down, but talking to someone could make a big difference. 

Do you have any specific mindfulness exercises you recommend? I'm open to trying new things.

Therapist: You've made some great points, Naomi. Practicing mindfulness techniques like deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation can be helpful, but it's true that it can be challenging to focus on them when you're feeling overwhelmed. That's why it's important to practice them regularly, even when you're not feeling particularly stressed. The more you practice, the more automatic and effective they become.

I'm glad to hear that you enjoy creative activities like writing poetry and cooking. Those are great ways to engage in self-care and give yourself a break from stressors. It can be helpful to make a list of activities like these that you find enjoyable or fulfilling so that you have a go-to list when you're feeling overwhelmed.

Regarding reaching out to your support network, that's a crucial part of managing depressive symptoms and preventing self-harm. It can be difficult to take that first step and reach out, but even a brief conversation with a trusted friend or family member can make a big difference in how you're feeling.

As for specific mindfulness exercises, there are many out there, and different techniques work for different people. One simple exercise is called the 5-5-5 technique. When you're feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to focus on your surroundings and name five things you can see, five things you can hear, and five things you can physically feel. This can help ground you in the present moment and reduce feelings of overwhelm.

Another technique is called "thought watching." When you notice yourself having negative or self-critical thoughts, imagine those thoughts as clouds passing by in the sky. You can observe them without getting caught up in them or judging them.

The key with mindfulness is to find what works for you and practice it regularly, even when you're not feeling particularly stressed. It's a skill that takes time to develop, but it can be incredibly helpful in managing overwhelming emotions and reducing self-harm.

What are your thoughts on these techniques, Naomi? Do you have any questions or concerns about implementing them?

Patient: The 5-5-5 technique sounds simple and manageable. I think I can try that when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Thought watching also seems like something I could practice, especially since I tend to get caught up in negative thoughts. 

I'm a bit worried about making time for these practices, though. I already feel like I'm juggling so many things, and adding more to my plate seems daunting. How do you suggest I fit these mindfulness exercises into my daily routine without feeling overwhelmed?

Therapist: It's understandable to be worried about adding mindfulness exercises to your daily routine, Naomi. When it comes to incorporating new practices into your life, it's important to start small and be patient with yourself. Remember that these techniques are meant to be helpful, not stressful.

One way to approach this is to begin with just one or two mindfulness exercises and gradually build up from there. You can start with something simple like deep breathing or the 5-5-5 technique, and then add a second practice like thought watching or a short meditation when you feel more comfortable.

It can be helpful to schedule these practices into your day, just as you would any other important task or commitment. You might choose a specific time of day when you're most likely to feel relaxed and open to practicing mindfulness, like first thing in the morning or during your lunch break.

Remember that it's okay to adjust your routine as needed. If you find that a particular mindfulness exercise isn't working for you, don't be afraid to change it up. The goal is to find what works best for your individual needs and preferences.

What are your thoughts on starting small and building up gradually, Naomi? Do you have any concerns or questions about scheduling mindfulness practices into your day?

Patient: Starting small and building up gradually makes sense. I think I can start with the 5-5-5 technique and deep breathing. I usually have a few minutes to myself in the morning before I start my day, so I could try incorporating those practices then. 

I'm still a bit worried about finding the time, but I guess if I start with just a few minutes each day, it won't feel too overwhelming. I'll give it a try and see how it goes. 

One thing I'm curious about is how long I should practice each technique. Should I aim for a certain amount of time each day, or is it more about consistency?

Therapist: It's great that you're starting with a few minutes of mindfulness practice each morning, Naomi. Consistency is key when it comes to incorporating these techniques into your daily routine. The length of your practice may vary depending on how much time you have and how you're feeling, but the most important part is to be patient and mindful during that time.

As you continue to practice, you may find that your mind wanders or that you have difficulty focusing. That's completely normal, and it's okay to gently redirect your attention back to the present moment. With regular practice, you may find that it becomes easier to stay focused and reap the benefits of mindfulness.

Remember that you can always adjust your mindfulness practice to fit your needs and preferences. If you find that a certain technique isn't working for you or that your schedule has changed, feel free to adapt your practice accordingly. The goal is to find what works best for your individual needs.

What are your thoughts on starting with a few minutes of practice each day, Naomi? Do you have any questions or concerns about making this practice consistent?

Patient: Starting with a few minutes each day sounds manageable. I think I can stick to that, especially if I start in the morning when I have a bit of time. 

I do have one concern, though. Sometimes, even when I'm practicing mindfulness, I still feel overwhelmed by my thoughts. It's like I can't escape them no matter what I do. How can I handle that?

Therapist: It's normal to still experience overwhelming thoughts even when you're practicing mindfulness, Naomi. In fact, it can be easier to become aware of these thoughts during a mindfulness practice because you're already in a state of heightened awareness.

One strategy for dealing with these thoughts is to practice mindful observation. Just like you would observe a passing cloud without getting caught up in it, you can observe your thoughts without engaging with them or letting them control your emotions.

Remember that your thoughts are not facts, and they may not always be accurate or helpful. When you notice yourself getting caught up in negative or self-critical thoughts, try to step back and observe them without judgment.

You can also practice mindfulness and mindful observation in combination with other techniques, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. These practices can help calm your mind and emotions, making it easier to observe your thoughts without getting overwhelmed.

What are your thoughts on this strategy, Naomi? Do you have any questions or concerns about observing your thoughts without engaging with them?

Patient: Observing my thoughts without engaging with them sounds like a good approach. I think it might help me see them more clearly and realize that they don't have to control me. 

I do have a question, though. Sometimes, my thoughts feel so intense that it's hard to just observe them. How can I handle those moments when my thoughts are really overwhelming?

Therapist: It's great that you're able to recognize the intensity of your thoughts, Naomi. When thoughts feel overwhelming, it can be helpful to practice a combination of mindful observation and grounding techniques.

Grounding techniques are activities that help you stay present in the moment and distract you from intense thoughts or emotions. They can be particularly helpful in moments when you feel like you're spiraling or getting lost in your head.

One common grounding technique is the 5-4-3-2-1 method. When you're feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can help bring your focus back to the present moment and away from your overwhelming thoughts.

Another grounding technique is deep breathing. When you're feeling overwhelmed, take slow, deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your lungs. You can also try a technique called "square breathing," where you inhale for four counts, hold for four counts, exhale for four counts, and then repeat.

By combining mindful observation with grounding techniques, you can take a step back from overwhelming thoughts and bring yourself back to the present moment. Remember, just like with mindfulness, these techniques take practice, so be patient with yourself as you learn to use them.

What are your thoughts on grounding techniques, Naomi? Do you have any questions or concerns about using them in combination with mindful observation?

Patient: The 5-4-3-2-1 method sounds like a practical way to ground myself when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I can see how it would help me focus on the present moment instead of getting lost in my thoughts. 

Deep breathing is something I've tried before, but I sometimes forget to do it when I'm really stressed. Maybe I should set a reminder on my phone to practice deep breathing a few times a day, just to make sure I'm doing it consistently. 

I think combining these techniques with mindful observation could be really helpful. I'll give them a try and see how it goes. 

One thing I'm still a bit unsure about is how to know when to use each technique. Should I always start with mindful observation and then move to grounding if needed, or is it okay to jump straight to grounding if I'm feeling really overwhelmed?

Therapist: It's great that you're thinking about incorporating both mindful observation and grounding techniques into your toolbox, Naomi. When it comes to knowing when to use each technique, it's a bit of a personal preference.

In general, mindful observation can be a good first step in managing overwhelming thoughts. By taking a step back and observing your thoughts without judgment, you can start to create some distance from them and realize that they don't have to control you.

However, if you find that mindful observation isn't enough to bring you back to the present moment, or if your thoughts feel particularly intense or distressing, it might be time to move on to a grounding technique.

Grounding techniques can help you shift your focus away from your thoughts and onto your senses, which can be a powerful way to bring yourself back to the present moment. It's okay to jump straight to a grounding technique if you need to, and remember that it's a skill that takes practice, so be patient with yourself.

As you continue to practice mindful observation and grounding techniques, you may find that it becomes easier to recognize when to use each one. Over time, you'll likely develop a gut feeling for when you need to observe, when you need to ground, or when you need a combination of the two.

What are your thoughts on this approach, Naomi? Do you have any questions or concerns about using mindful observation and grounding techniques together?

Patient: I think this approach makes sense. I'll start with mindful observation and then move to grounding if I need to. It's good to know that I can jump straight to grounding if I'm feeling really overwhelmed. 

I'm curious about one thing, though. How can I tell if I'm making progress with these techniques? Sometimes it feels like I'm just going through the motions without seeing any real change.

Therapist: It's a common concern to wonder if you're making progress with mindfulness and grounding techniques, Naomi. One way to tell if you're making progress is to pay attention to how often you're using these techniques and how effective they feel in the moment.

For example, you might notice that you're using mindful observation more frequently and finding it more helpful over time. Or you might find that you're using grounding techniques less often because you're getting better at managing overwhelming thoughts through other means.

Another way to tell if you're making progress is to pay attention to how these techniques are affecting your overall mood and functioning. If you're finding that you're feeling less overwhelmed overall or that you're able to get more done without feeling as drained, that's a sign of progress.

It's also important to remember that progress isn't always linear. There might be days when it feels like you're taking two steps forward and one step back. That's okay, and it doesn't mean that you're not making progress.

What are your thoughts on these ways to measure progress, Naomi? Do you have any questions or concerns about how to know if you're making progress with these techniques?

Patient: I think paying attention to how often I'm using these techniques and how effective they feel is a good way to measure progress. I can also keep an eye on my overall mood and functioning to see if there's any improvement. 

I do have a question, though. Sometimes, even when I'm using these techniques, I still feel like I'm not making any progress. How can I stay motivated when it feels like nothing is changing?

Therapist: It's great that you're considering these measures of progress, Naomi. It can be challenging to maintain motivation when you don't feel like you're making progress, but there are a few things you can do to help yourself stay motivated.

First, it can be helpful to celebrate your small victories along the way. Even if you don't feel like you're making big changes, there might be moments when you're able to use a mindfulness or grounding technique effectively, or when you find yourself feeling a bit better than before. Those small victories are important to acknowledge and celebrate.

Another way to stay motivated is to connect with your reasons for wanting to make these changes in the first place. What inspired you to start practicing mindfulness and grounding techniques? What do you hope to gain from using these techniques? Remembering those reasons can help you stay focused on your goals, even when progress feels slow.

Finally, it can be helpful to reach out for support when you're feeling unmotivated. Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist can remind you of your progress and give you a boost of encouragement.

What are your thoughts on these strategies for staying motivated, Naomi? Do you have any questions or concerns about how to maintain motivation when you're feeling stuck?

Patient: Celebrating small victories and remembering my reasons for wanting to make these changes are good strategies. I think it's important to acknowledge the progress I'm making, even if it feels small. 

Reaching out for support is also a good idea. I've been trying to be more open with my friends about what I'm going through, and it helps to know that they're there for me. 

I do have one concern, though. Sometimes, even when I'm using these techniques and staying motivated, I still feel like I'm not making any progress. How can I handle those moments when it feels like nothing is changing?

Therapist: It's great that you're taking steps to celebrate your small victories, remember your reasons for using these techniques, and reach out for support when you're feeling unmotivated, Naomi.

When it feels like nothing is changing, it can be helpful to remind yourself that progress is often slow and nonlinear. There will likely be times when you feel stuck, even when you're doing everything right. Those moments don't mean that you're not making progress; they're just part of the process.

One way to handle those moments is to practice self-compassion. Remind yourself that everyone struggles sometimes, and that it's okay to feel stuck. Be kind to yourself, and remind yourself that your worth isn't determined by how much progress you're making.

Another way to handle those moments is to take a step back and assess your overall progress. Even if it feels like nothing is changing, you might be able to recognize progress in other areas of your life. For example, you might be able to see that you're using mindfulness techniques more frequently or that you're reaching out for support more often.

Finally, it can be helpful to make a plan for what to do when you're feeling stuck. This might include identifying specific coping strategies you can use, like reaching out to a friend or engaging in a self-care activity, or setting aside time to practice mindfulness or grounding techniques. Having a plan in place can help you feel more empowered and less overwhelmed when you're feeling stuck.

What are your thoughts on these strategies for handling moments when it feels like nothing is changing, Naomi? Do you have any questions or concerns about self-compassion, assessing progress, or making a plan for when you're feeling stuck?

Patient: Practicing self-compassion and reminding myself that everyone struggles sometimes is a good way to handle those moments when it feels like nothing is changing. It's important to be kind to myself and not be too hard on myself.

Assessing my overall progress is also a good idea. Even if it feels like nothing is changing, I might be able to see progress in other areas of my life. For example, I might be using mindfulness techniques more frequently or reaching out for support more often.

Making a plan for what to do when I'm feeling stuck is a good strategy too. It can help me feel more empowered and less overwhelmed when I'm feeling stuck. I can identify specific coping strategies I can use, like reaching out to a friend or engaging in a self-care activity, or setting aside time to practice mindfulness or grounding techniques.

I do have one question, though. How can I make sure that my plan for handling moments when I'm feeling stuck is effective?

Therapist: It's great that you're considering how to make sure that your plan for handling moments when you're feeling stuck is effective, Naomi. One way to make your plan more effective is to practice it when you're not feeling stuck. This can help you refine your plan and figure out what works best for you.

Another way to make your plan more effective is to involve other people in your support network. Sharing your plan with trusted friends, family members, or therapists can help you stay accountable and get support when you need it.

Finally, it can be helpful to reassess your plan regularly and make adjustments as needed. Your plan might change over time as you learn more about what works best for you and your specific needs and challenges.

Patient: Practicing my plan when I'm not feeling stuck is a good idea. It can help me refine my plan and figure out what works best for me.

Involving other people in my support network is also a good idea. Sharing my plan with trusted friends, family members, or therapists can help me stay accountable and get support when I need it.

Reassessing my plan regularly and making adjustments as needed is a good strategy too. My plan might change over time as I learn more about what works best for me and my specific needs and challenges.

I think I'll start by practicing my plan when I'm not feeling stuck and involving other people in my support network. I'll reassess my plan regularly and make adjustments as needed.

Thank you for your help, Nova. I feel more confident about handling moments when I'm feeling stuck now.

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi. I'm glad that you've found these strategies helpful. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you continue to practice these techniques and make progress.

Patient: I'll keep that in mind, Nova. Progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. I'll be patient and compassionate with myself as I continue to practice these techniques and make progress.

I think I'm ready to wrap up this session. Thank you for your help today. I feel more confident about handling moments when I'm feeling stuck now.
