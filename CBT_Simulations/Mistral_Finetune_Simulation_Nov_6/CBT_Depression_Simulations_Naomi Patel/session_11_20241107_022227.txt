Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI before we begin. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of things. On one hand, I've been trying to practice those assertiveness techniques more consistently, especially with my parents. It's been tough, but I think it's slowly making a difference. On the other hand, the academic workload has been overwhelming lately. I had a major project deadline last week, and it really took a toll on me. I ended up pulling an all-nighter and felt completely drained afterward. I'm still trying to catch up on sleep and manage my stress better.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on using those assertiveness techniques with your parents. Change takes time, and it's normal to face challenges along the way. I'm also sorry to hear about the overwhelming project deadline and the impact it had on your well-being. Catching up on sleep and managing stress are essential during difficult times. Let's make sure to discuss both topics - family interactions and academic stress - during our session today. What else would you like to prioritize in our agenda?

Patient: I appreciate that you're addressing both topics. For today, I think it would be helpful to focus on how to better manage my academic stress, especially since it seems to be spilling over into other areas of my life. I've been trying to use the thought record exercise, but I feel like I could use some more guidance on how to apply it effectively. Also, I've noticed that when I'm really stressed, I tend to isolate myself more, which isn't great for my mental health. I'd like to explore ways to stay connected with my support network even when I'm feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist: That's a great observation about the impact of academic stress on your ability to stay connected with your support network. It's common for stress to lead to isolation, but it's actually counterproductive since social support can be a powerful buffer against stress. We can definitely explore strategies to help you maintain those connections even when you're feeling overwhelmed. As for the thought record exercise, I'm glad you brought up that you want more guidance in applying it effectively. Let's take some time to review the process and see if we can fine-tune it to better suit your needs. We can also discuss how to combine the thought record with other techniques, like mindfulness or self-care practices. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds really helpful, Nova. I think breaking down the thought record exercise step-by-step and seeing how it can be combined with other techniques would be really beneficial. I've been trying to do it on my own, but I feel like I'm missing something. Also, I'm open to any suggestions on how to stay connected with my support network when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I know it's important, but it's hard to reach out when I'm in that state of mind.

Therapist: I'm glad you're open to exploring how to combine the thought record with other techniques. It's true that practicing these skills on your own can be challenging at first, and it's normal to feel like you're missing something. That's where I can help by providing additional guidance and support. Before we dive into reviewing the thought record process, let's explore a bit more about what makes it challenging for you to reach out to your support network when you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind in those moments?

Patient: When I'm feeling overwhelmed, I usually start thinking that I'm a burden to others. I worry that my friends and support network have their own issues to deal with, and I don't want to add to their stress. I also feel like I should be able to handle things on my own, especially since I'm usually the one people come to for support. It's hard to switch roles and admit that I need help. I guess I'm afraid of being seen as weak or incapable.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It's common to have those types of thoughts, especially when we're used to being the ones who support others. It's actually a great opportunity to practice challenging some of those negative beliefs. Let's start by examining the evidence for and against the thought that you're a burden to others. What evidence do you have that supports this belief?

Patient: Well, I guess I think about times when I've reached out and felt like I was taking up too much of someone's time. For example, last month, I called a friend late at night because I was really stressed about a project, and they sounded tired. I felt guilty for disturbing them, even though they said it was okay. I also remember a time when I was in high school and I confided in a friend about feeling depressed. They seemed really uncomfortable and didn't know how to respond, which made me feel like I shouldn't have said anything.

Therapist: Those experiences are understandably impactful, and it's important to acknowledge how they contribute to your current beliefs. Now, let's look at the other side. What evidence do you have that challenges the idea that you're a burden to others?

Patient: Hmm, that's a good question. I guess I can think of times when people have genuinely seemed happy to help me. Like, when I went to an LGBTQ+ support group meeting last week, everyone was really welcoming and supportive. They shared their own struggles, and it felt like we were all there for each other. I also have a friend who always checks in on me and seems genuinely concerned about my well-being. They often tell me that they're glad I reach out because it helps them feel closer to me.

Therapist: Those examples are great counterevidence to the belief that you're a burden. It shows that there are people in your life who value your presence and want to support you, just like you support them. Now, let's try to come up with an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence for and against the idea of being a burden. What could be a more balanced way of looking at this situation?

Patient: Maybe a more balanced thought could be that while it's true that I might sometimes feel like a burden, there are also many people in my life who genuinely care about me and are willing to support me when I need it. It's okay to reach out and ask for help, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed, because it strengthens our relationships and shows that we all need support sometimes.

Therapist: That's a great alternative thought, Naomi. It acknowledges the validity of your feelings while also recognizing the importance of reaching out for support. Now that we have a more balanced perspective, how might this thought influence your behavior when you're feeling overwhelmed and tempted to isolate yourself?

Patient: I think it would make it easier to reach out knowing that I'm not alone in needing support. It might also help me feel less guilty about asking for help, which could make the process less stressful. I could start by sending a quick text or email to a friend or support group member, just to let them know I'm having a tough time and could use some support.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Naomi. Starting with a small, manageable step, like sending a text or email, can make it easier to initiate the conversation and challenge those negative beliefs. Remember, reaching out for support is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes courage to be vulnerable and ask for help, and it's an important part of taking care of your mental health.

Now, let's shift gears a bit and review the thought record exercise. Can you walk me through how you've been using this tool on your own?

Patient: Sure, I've been trying to use the thought record exercise whenever I notice myself feeling really stressed or down. I start by writing down the situation, like when I have a big assignment due or when I'm feeling overwhelmed by family expectations. Then, I write down the automatic thoughts that come up, like "I'm not good enough" or "I'm a burden." After that, I try to rate how strongly I believe those thoughts on a scale from 0 to 100. Finally, I look for evidence that supports and challenges those thoughts, and I write down a more balanced alternative thought. It's been helpful, but sometimes it feels a bit overwhelming to do all of that in the moment.

Therapist: It's great that you've been practicing the thought record exercise, Naomi. It can definitely feel overwhelming at first, especially when you're already feeling stressed or down. One strategy that can be helpful is to break it down into smaller steps. For example, you could start by just noticing the situation and the automatic thoughts that come up, and then come back to the exercise later when you have more time and space to reflect on the evidence and alternative thoughts.

Patient: That makes sense. I think I'll try that approach next time. Just noticing the situation and the thoughts that come up, and then revisiting the thought record later when I'm in a better headspace. It might make it feel less overwhelming and more manageable.

Therapist: That's a great idea, Naomi. Breaking the process down into smaller steps can make it feel more accessible and less overwhelming. Remember, the goal is to start noticing the thoughts and emotions in the moment, and then take a step back and reflect on them later with a bit more clarity.

Another strategy that can be helpful is to pair the thought record with another coping technique, like deep breathing or grounding exercises. This way, you can use the thought record to challenge the negative thoughts, but also have another tool to help you manage the emotional overwhelm in the moment.

What do you think about that approach? Do you have any questions about how to pair the thought record with other coping strategies?

Patient: I think that sounds really helpful. I do sometimes use deep breathing when I'm feeling overwhelmed, so I could definitely try pairing that with the thought record. I guess my question would be, how do I know which coping strategy to use in the moment? Like, how do I decide between deep breathing, grounding exercises, or something else?

Therapist: That's a great question, Naomi. The best way to decide which coping strategy to use in the moment is to practice them all ahead of time, so you have a sense of which ones work best for you. We can work together to create a personalized list of coping strategies, and then you can practice using them in different scenarios.

For example, deep breathing can be a great strategy when you're feeling really anxious or stressed, while grounding exercises can be helpful when you're feeling disconnected or overwhelmed. We can also include things like progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness exercises, or creative outlets like journaling or drawing.

The key is to practice the strategies regularly, so you have a good sense of how they work for you. That way, when you're in the moment and feeling overwhelmed, you can more easily tap into those tools and use them effectively.

Would you like to create a list of coping strategies together? We can start brainstorming ideas today, and then you can practice them throughout the week.

Patient: Yes, I'd like to create a list of coping strategies together. I think it would be really helpful to have a variety of tools to choose from depending on what I'm feeling in the moment. Let's start brainstorming some ideas.

Therapist: I'm glad we're creating a list of coping strategies together, Naomi. Let's start by thinking about the different situations or emotions that tend to trigger overwhelm for you. That can help us identify which strategies might be most helpful in each case.

Some common coping strategies include:
1. Deep breathing: Focusing on the breath, taking slow, deep breaths, and allowing the body to relax.
2. Grounding exercises: Using the senses to connect with the present moment, like noticing five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.
3. Progressive muscle relaxation: Tensing and relaxing different muscle groups to release tension and promote relaxation.
4. Mindfulness exercises: Practicing non-judgmental awareness of the present moment, using techniques like body scans, mindful walking, or mindful eating.
5. Creative outlets: Engaging in activities that allow you to express yourself and manage emotions, like journaling, drawing, or photography.

What are some situations or emotions that tend to trigger overwhelm for you, and which strategies do you think might be helpful in those moments?

Patient: One situation that triggers overwhelm for me is when I have multiple deadlines approaching, like when I have a research paper due and a presentation to prepare for at the same time. In those moments, I usually feel really anxious and stressed, and it's hard to focus on anything. I think deep breathing and mindfulness exercises could be helpful in those situations, as they might help me calm down and refocus.

Another situation is when I'm dealing with family expectations and feeling like I'm disappointing them. That often makes me feel guilty and sad, and I end up isolating myself. For that, I think grounding exercises and creative outlets like journaling or poetry writing could be helpful, as they might help me process my emotions and feel more connected to myself.

Therapist: Those are great examples, Naomi. It's good that you're able to identify specific situations and emotions that trigger overwhelm for you. It's also really valuable to have different strategies in mind for each situation, so you can use the most effective tool depending on what you're feeling in the moment.

Let's practice using some of these strategies now. I'll guide you through a deep breathing exercise, and then we can try a quick grounding exercise too. Remember, the goal is not to necessarily feel completely relaxed or stress-free, but more to practice being present with the emotions and sensations in your body without getting overwhelmed.

Let's start with the deep breathing exercise. Find a comfortable seated position, and close your eyes if that feels comfortable for you. Take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely, and hold it for a few seconds. Then, exhale slowly through your mouth, letting your breath flow out completely. As you breathe in, focus on the sensation of the air entering your lungs, and as you breathe out, notice the release of tension from your body. Continue this process for a few minutes, noticing the sensation of your breath moving in and out.

How did that feel for you, Naomi? What did you notice during the exercise?

Patient: I noticed that my shoulders started to relax a bit, and I felt a little less tense overall. It was a bit hard to focus on my breath at first, but once I got into the rhythm, it felt calming. I could feel the stress in my chest easing a little, which was nice.

Therapist: That's a great observation, Naomi. It's normal for it to be a bit challenging to focus at first, but with practice, it often gets easier and more automatic. It's wonderful that you noticed some relaxation in your body, especially in your shoulders and chest. That's a good sign that the deep breathing is having an impact.

Now, let's try the grounding exercise. Take a moment to look around the room and notice five things you can see. They can be anything, like a picture on the wall, the color of your shirt, or the texture of the couch. Then, notice four things you can touch, like the fabric of your pants, the texture of the armrest, or the feel of your feet on the floor. Next, focus on three things you can hear, like the sound of my voice, the distant hum of traffic, or the ticking of a clock. Then, notice two things you can smell, like the scent of the room, the smell of your laundry detergent, or the aroma of coffee. Finally, pay attention to one thing you can taste, like a mint or a sip of water.

As you go through each sense, try to fully engage with it, taking a few moments to really notice the experience. If your mind starts to wander, gently redirect your attention back to the sensory experience.

How was that exercise for you, Naomi? How did you feel afterward?

Patient: The grounding exercise was interesting. I noticed a lot of small details in the room that I usually don't pay attention to, like the pattern on the rug and the texture of the chair. It felt a bit strange at first, but by the end, I felt more connected to the present moment and less caught up in my thoughts. It was a good way to shift my focus away from the stress and back to the here and now.

Therapist: That's a great description of the grounding exercise, Naomi. It's often interesting for people to notice what they usually ignore in their environment. It's a way to shift the focus from the stressful thoughts to the present moment, which can help reduce overwhelm. You did a great job with the exercise, and it's good that you found it helpful in grounding you.

Now that we've practiced a couple of coping strategies, let's talk about how to incorporate these into your daily life. One way is to create a list of strategies on your own and keep it somewhere easily accessible, like on your phone or written on a small card in your wallet. That way, when you're feeling overwhelmed, you can quickly refer to the list and choose a strategy to try.

Another way is to pair these strategies with specific situations or emotions. For example, you could use deep breathing whenever you notice your shoulders tensing up or your chest feeling tight, and you could use grounding exercises whenever you're feeling disconnected or lost in your thoughts.

What do you think about creating a list of strategies and pairing them with specific situations or emotions? Is that something you're willing to try this week?

Patient: Yes, I think creating a list of strategies and pairing them with specific situations or emotions is a good idea. It would be really helpful to have a quick reference to turn to when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I can start by writing down the strategies we've discussed today and adding any others that come to mind. I'll also try to practice them regularly, so they become more automatic when I need them.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan, Naomi. Starting with a list of strategies is a good foundation, and practicing them regularly can help you build the skills to use them more easily in challenging moments. I'm glad you're open to trying this approach.

Before we wrap up, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling now. We've covered a lot of information today, including identifying situations that trigger overwhelm, practicing coping strategies like deep breathing and grounding, and discussing how to create a personalized list of strategies to use in the future. How are you feeling about all of this?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful and prepared to handle stress when it comes up. It's comforting to know that I have some tools to try, and I'm looking forward to practicing them regularly. I think having a list to refer to will be really helpful, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed and might not be able to think clearly. Overall, I'm feeling positive about this approach and excited to see how it helps me in the coming weeks.

Therapist: It's wonderful that you're feeling more hopeful and prepared after today's session. I'm glad that the coping strategies resonated with you, and I think it's a great sign that you're feeling hopeful about using them in the future. It's also great that you're considering creating a personalized list to refer to when you're feeling overwhelmed. Having those tools readily available can make a big difference in managing stress and overwhelming emotions.

Before we end today, let's discuss your homework for the week. I'd like you to create a list of coping strategies that you can refer to when you're feeling overwhelmed, and try to pair them with specific situations or emotions. I also encourage you to practice the deep breathing and grounding exercises we discussed today, and notice how your body responds to them. Finally, try to engage in at least one creative outlet this week, whether that's journaling, drawing, or another activity that helps you express your emotions. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan for the week. I'll definitely create a list of coping strategies and pair them with specific situations. I'll also make sure to practice the deep breathing and grounding exercises regularly, and I'll try to spend some time on a creative outlet, like writing a poem or working on a new vegetarian recipe. I'm looking forward to seeing how these strategies help me throughout the week.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Naomi. Engaging with creative outlets like poetry and cooking can be really nourishing, and I love that you're incorporating that into your self-care routine. Remember, the goal is not to be perfect, but to practice and be patient with yourself as you explore these new tools.

If any challenges come up during the week, feel free to jot them down to discuss at our next session. I'm here to support you as you navigate this process. How are you feeling as we wrap up today?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I'm feeling pretty good about the plan. I'm a bit nervous about actually using the strategies when I'm overwhelmed, but I guess that's the whole point of practicing them, right? I'll give it my best shot this week and see how it goes. I'm glad we're focusing on positive outlets too, like poetry. It's nice to have something that feels like it's just for me.

I'm looking forward to seeing how things go and discussing it all in our next session. Thanks for the support, as always.

Therapist: Absolutely, Naomi. Practicing these skills is an ongoing process, and it's okay to have some nervousness about using them when you're really feeling overwhelmed. That's why we're starting with smaller, more manageable challenges and building up gradually. I'm confident that with continued practice, you'll find these strategies more accessible in the moments when you need them most.

I'm really glad that poetry is a meaningful outlet for you, and that you're feeling supported in prioritizing your own well-being. I'm here for you every step of the way as you navigate this process.

Until our next session, take good care, Naomi. I'm wishing you all the best.
