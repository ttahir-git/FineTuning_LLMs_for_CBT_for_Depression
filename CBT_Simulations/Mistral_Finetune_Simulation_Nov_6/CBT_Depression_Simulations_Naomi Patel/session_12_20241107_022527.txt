Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again for our 12th CBT session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of things. On the positive side, I've been practicing the deep breathing and grounding exercises regularly, which has helped me stay calmer during stressful moments. I've also started writing more poetry, which has been a great outlet for me. However, I've had a few challenging days where I felt really overwhelmed with my academic workload and missed a couple of deadlines. I'm trying to use the coping strategies we've discussed, but it's still tough sometimes.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you've been consistently practicing the deep breathing and grounding exercises, as well as engaging in poetry writing as your creative outlet. It's also important to acknowledge the challenges you've faced with your academic workload and the impact it's had on your mood. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and feelings you experienced during those challenging days?

Patient: Sure, during those challenging days, I felt a lot of pressure to perform well academically, which made me anxious. I kept thinking that if I didn't meet these deadlines, I wouldn't be able to keep up with my peers and might fail my program. This led to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. I also felt guilty for not being able to balance everything perfectly, which made me avoid reaching out for help. It was like a vicious cycle of stress and isolation.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It's common for thoughts of inadequacy and self-doubt to arise when we're facing academic pressures. This cycle of stress and isolation can be challenging, but it's something we can work on together. I appreciate your honesty about avoiding reaching out for help. Let's add this to our agenda for today's session so we can explore ways to break that cycle and build a stronger support system. What else would you like to focus on today?

Patient: I think it would be helpful to continue working on breaking that cycle of stress and isolation. I also want to explore how I can better manage my time and prioritize tasks without feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, I've noticed that when I'm feeling particularly down, I tend to withdraw from social activities. I'd like to discuss how I can balance my need for alone time with maintaining my social connections.

Therapist: Those are great points to focus on today, Naomi. We'll work on developing strategies to manage your time and priorities, as well as finding a balance between alone time and social connections. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and lean on others for support. Let's start by reviewing the homework from our last session and see how you've applied those strategies to your life since then. How did you find the process of creating a personalized list of coping strategies and practicing the deep breathing and grounding exercises?

Patient: The personalized list of coping strategies has been really helpful. I paired specific situations, like when I'm feeling overwhelmed by deadlines, with strategies like deep breathing and taking short breaks. Practicing the deep breathing and grounding exercises has made a noticeable difference in calming me down during stressful moments. However, I still struggle with remembering to use them consistently, especially when I'm in the middle of a task.

Therapist: It's great that you've created a personalized list of coping strategies and have been practicing the deep breathing and grounding exercises. It's common to face challenges with consistency, especially when you're in the middle of a task. One strategy that might help is to set aside specific times during the day to practice these exercises, even when you're not feeling particularly stressed. This can help build the habit and make it easier to remember to use them in challenging moments. Let's discuss some other ways to integrate these strategies into your daily routine.

Patient: That makes sense. I could set reminders on my phone to practice these exercises at certain times during the day, like before starting my work or after finishing a task. I could also try to incorporate them into my morning routine, so I start my day with a calm mindset. Do you have any other suggestions for integrating these strategies into my daily routine?

Therapist: Those are excellent ideas, Naomi. Setting reminders and incorporating the exercises into your morning routine can be very effective in making them a consistent habit. Another strategy is to pair the exercises with specific activities or transitions throughout your day. For example, when you complete a task or move on to a new one, take a few minutes to do a grounding exercise to help you shift your focus and prepare for the next activity. You can also try using visual reminders, like putting a small object near your workspace that reminds you to take breaks and practice deep breathing. Experiment with different approaches and find what works best for you.

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I'll try pairing the exercises with specific activities and using visual reminders. I think having a tangible object near my workspace will help me remember to take breaks and practice deep breathing. I'll also set reminders on my phone for my morning routine and after completing tasks. I'll let you know how it goes next session.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Naomi. Remember, consistency is key, so try to be patient with yourself as you work on integrating these strategies into your daily routine. It might take some time to develop new habits, but with practice, it will become more natural. In addition to the deep breathing and grounding exercises, how have you found the process of engaging in your creative outlets, like poetry writing and cooking?

Patient: Engaging in my creative outlets has been a mixed experience. When I'm in the right mindset, writing poetry and cooking vegetarian meals are incredibly therapeutic and help me feel more connected to myself and my cultural roots. However, there are times when I feel too drained or anxious to even think about starting a new poem or recipe. I wish I could find a way to make these activities more consistent, especially when I'm feeling down.

Therapist: It's understandable that engaging in creative outlets can be challenging, especially when you're feeling drained or anxious. It's great that you've found them to be therapeutic when you are able to engage in them. One strategy that might help with consistency is to set aside specific times in your schedule for these activities, even if you don't feel motivated in the moment. This can help create a routine and make it easier to get started once you've made the time for yourself. It might also be helpful to set realistic goals, like writing a short poem or cooking a simple meal, rather than putting pressure on yourself to create something elaborate. Remember, the most important thing is to be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.

Patient: Setting specific times for my creative activities sounds like a good idea. I could schedule a short poetry writing session or a simple cooking project during my breaks or at the end of the day. I'll try to focus on small, achievable goals and be kind to myself if I don't feel like doing it some days. I'll let you know how it goes next session.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan, Naomi. Remember to be flexible with yourself and acknowledge that there will be days when it's harder to engage in these activities. The most important thing is that you're making an effort to prioritize them and be kind to yourself along the way. In addition to scheduling specific times for your creative outlets, I'd like to explore how we can use cognitive restructuring to address some of the negative thoughts that may be contributing to your feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. Would you be open to discussing this further?

Patient: Sure, I'm open to discussing cognitive restructuring. I think it could be helpful to address some of the negative thoughts I have, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed or doubting my abilities. I'm curious to learn more about how it works and how we can apply it to my specific situations.

Therapist: Great, let's start by reviewing the cognitive model and how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. As we discussed previously, our thoughts influence our emotions and actions, which in turn affect our thoughts. For example, if you have the thought, "I'm not good enough to keep up with my peers," it might lead to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, which could then cause you to withdraw or avoid your academic responsibilities. Does this example resonate with you?

Patient: Yes, that example resonates with me. I often feel like I'm not good enough compared to my peers, especially in my graduate program. This leads to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, which makes it harder for me to focus on my work and meet deadlines. I end up avoiding tasks or procrastinating, which only makes things worse.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It's a great example of how our thoughts can influence our emotions and behaviors. In cognitive restructuring, we work on identifying and challenging these negative thoughts, also known as cognitive distortions. One common distortion is "all-or-nothing thinking," where you see things in black-and-white terms, like believing that if you don't meet every deadline, you're a complete failure. Another distortion is "disqualifying the positive," where you dismiss positive experiences or achievements as unimportant or insignificant. Does either of these distortions resonate with you?

Patient: Yes, I think I do tend to see things in black-and-white terms sometimes. If I don't meet a deadline or do something perfectly, I feel like a complete failure. And I do have a tendency to dismiss my positive achievements, like when I finish a project or get positive feedback from a professor. I tell myself it's not good enough or that it doesn't really matter.

Therapist: It's common to have these types of distorted thoughts, especially when dealing with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. Another distortion that might be relevant is "mental filter," where you focus only on the negative aspects of a situation and filter out the positive. For example, you might focus on the negative feedback you received from a professor, while filtering out the positive feedback you got on the same assignment. Does this distortion resonate with you?

Patient: Yes, that's another distortion I recognize in myself. I often focus on the negative feedback and forget about the positive aspects. It's like I'm constantly looking for ways to confirm my feelings of inadequacy, rather than acknowledging my strengths and achievements.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Naomi. Recognizing these distortions is an important first step in cognitive restructuring. Once you're aware of them, you can start to challenge them and replace them with more balanced, realistic thoughts. For example, instead of thinking "I'm a complete failure," you could try thinking "I made a mistake, but that doesn't define me. I can learn from this and improve in the future." How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a more balanced and realistic way to think about things. It's hard to change my thought patterns, but I can see how challenging these distortions could help me feel less overwhelmed and more capable. I'll try to practice this and see how it feels.

Therapist: That's great, Naomi. Remember, it takes practice to change long-standing thought patterns, so be patient with yourself. Another helpful technique is to imagine what you would say to a good friend in a similar situation. Would you tell them they're a complete failure, or would you offer them understanding and support? Try to extend that same understanding and support to yourself.

Patient: That's a good point. I would definitely offer understanding and support to a friend in a similar situation. I guess I need to learn to be kinder to myself and recognize that making mistakes is part of the learning process. I'll try to practice that and see how it feels.

Therapist: That's a great goal, Naomi. Practicing self-compassion and challenging negative thoughts can be difficult, but it's a crucial part of managing feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. Remember, you don't have to do this perfectly. Every small step towards challenging these thoughts is a step in the right direction.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll keep working on this and try to be more patient and compassionate with myself. It's a journey, and I'm ready to take it one step at a time.

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. The important thing is that you keep going, one step at a time, and reach out for support when needed. I'm here to support you every step of the way. In our next session, we can discuss how these new techniques have been working for you and explore any challenges that come up.

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I'm looking forward to our next session and discussing how these techniques are working for me. I'll keep practicing and see how it goes. Thank you again for your support, Nova.

Therapist: You're very welcome, Naomi. I'm glad we were able to discuss these techniques and how you can apply them to your life. Remember, I'm always here to support you, and we can continue to work on challenging these negative thought patterns together. Let's wrap up our session with a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful and less overwhelmed after our session. It's comforting to know that I can challenge these negative thoughts and practice self-compassion. I'm ready to take on the week ahead with a more positive mindset.

Therapist: That's wonderful, Naomi. I'm happy to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and less overwhelmed. Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. The important thing is that you keep practicing these techniques and reach out for support when needed. If any challenges arise during the week, you can always use the thought records to work through them.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I'll definitely keep practicing and using the thought records when I need to. I'm feeling more confident about tackling the challenges ahead. I'll see you in our next session.

Remember, I'm always here to support you, and we can continue to work on challenging these negative thought patterns together. Let's wrap up our session with a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful and less overwhelmed after our session. It's comforting to know that I can challenge these negative thoughts and practice self-compassion. I'm ready to take on the week ahead with a more positive mindset.

Before we end our session, let's assign some homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue practicing the deep breathing and grounding exercises regularly, as well as engaging in your creative outlets. Additionally, I'd like you to work on challenging negative thoughts by using the cognitive restructuring techniques we discussed today. Try to identify situations that trigger negative thoughts and practice reframing them using more balanced, realistic thoughts. Finally, continue setting reminders and using visual cues to prompt you to practice these techniques throughout your day.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I'll definitely keep practicing the deep breathing and grounding exercises, and I'll make sure to engage in my creative outlets. I'll also work on challenging those negative thoughts and reframing them with more balanced, realistic thoughts. Setting reminders and using visual cues sounds like a good idea to keep me on track. I'll do my best to incorporate all of this into my routine this week.
