Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again for our ninth session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I'm here to support you, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a chance I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to working with you and supporting your journey towards better mental health. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your honesty. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of things. On one hand, I've been trying to practice more self-compassion and challenge those perfectionist thoughts you mentioned. It's been tough, but I think I'm making some progress. On the other hand, I had a really stressful week with a major project deadline, and I ended up having to pull an all-nighter. That took a toll on me physically and emotionally. I also had a difficult conversation with my parents about my poetry being read without permission. They apologized, but it still left me feeling uneasy about boundaries. How do you think I can better manage these conflicting feelings and stressors?

Therapist: Naomi, I hear you. It's great that you've been working on self-compassion and challenging perfectionist thoughts. It's also important that we discuss the challenging situation with your parents and the stress you experienced with the project deadline. Let's take a moment to explore your emotions further. Can you tell me more about how the conversation with your parents made you feel and what thoughts were going through your mind?

Patient: The conversation with my parents made me feel a mix of anger, hurt, and confusion. I was angry because I felt like my privacy was invaded, and hurt because it felt like they didn't respect my boundaries. Confusion came from trying to understand why they did it and how to move forward. My thoughts were all over the placeâ€”I kept thinking about how I can't trust them with my personal things, but also feeling guilty for thinking that way because they're my parents and they love me. It's really hard to balance these feelings.

Therapist: Naomi, I understand how challenging it can be to balance these complex emotions, especially when it involves a family member. It's common to feel angry, hurt, and confused in situations like this. Your thoughts about trust and guilt are also valid points. Let's take a moment to explore these feelings further. Can you tell me more about the anger you experienced during and after the conversation? What specific actions or words of your parents triggered this emotion?

Patient: The anger was triggered by the fact that they went through my personal things without asking. My poetry is really important to me, and it's where I express my deepest thoughts and feelings. Knowing that they read it without my permission made me feel like they invaded my personal space and didn't respect my privacy. It felt like they were trying to control me or understand me in a way that was too intrusive. I also felt angry because I had to confront them about it, which is something I really didn't want to do. It made me feel like I had to defend my boundaries, which is exhausting.

Therapist: Naomi, I appreciate you sharing the specific triggers for your anger. It's understandable that your parents' actions would lead to feelings of invasion, lack of respect, and control. It's also common to feel exhausted when having to assert boundaries, especially with family members. Let's discuss how you can work on communicating your boundaries effectively while also taking care of yourself. What do you think would help you feel more empowered in these situations?

Patient: I think feeling more empowered would come from being able to clearly communicate my boundaries and having them respected. I also need to find ways to take care of myself when these situations arise. Maybe practicing assertiveness techniques could help, but I'm not sure how to do that in a way that feels authentic to me. Do you have any suggestions or exercises that could help with this?

Therapist: Absolutely, Naomi. Learning assertiveness techniques can be incredibly helpful in maintaining healthy boundaries while also taking care of yourself. One exercise we can practice together is the "I" statement. This involves expressing your feelings, needs, and boundaries using "I" instead of "you" statements, which can often feel blaming or aggressive. For example, instead of saying, "You invaded my privacy," you could say, "I feel violated when my privacy is invaded." Does this make sense?

Patient: Yes, that makes sense. Using "I" statements sounds like a good way to express my feelings without sounding accusatory. I can see how that would help in making my boundaries clearer. Could you give me an example of how I might use an "I" statement in a situation with my parents?

Therapist: Certainly, Naomi. Let's imagine you want to express your feelings about your parents reading your poetry without permission. You could say something like, "I feel hurt and violated when my personal writing is read without my consent. I need to feel safe and protected in my own space, and I would appreciate it if you could respect my boundaries around my poetry." How does that feel to you?

Patient: That feels a lot better. It's more about how I feel and what I need, rather than blaming them. I think I can practice this and use it in future conversations. It might help me feel more in control and less angry. Thanks for the example, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi. I'm glad you found it helpful. Remember, learning to assert your boundaries takes practice, and it's okay to take your time with it. Another helpful technique is role-playing. We can practice using "I" statements together in different scenarios, such as work situations or family gatherings. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a good idea. Role-playing could help me get more comfortable with using "I" statements in real situations. Let's try it with a work scenario first. Imagine I'm in a meeting, and a professor is pushing me to take on more responsibilities than I can handle. How would I use an "I" statement in that situation?

Therapist: Let's try role-playing an "I" statement in the work situation you described. Imagine you're in that meeting with the professor, and you feel overwhelmed by the expectations. How could you express your feelings and boundaries?

Patient: Okay, let's see. I could say, "I feel overwhelmed by the additional responsibilities being asked of me. I need to prioritize my current tasks and ensure I can deliver quality work. Could we discuss a more manageable workload?" How does that sound?

Therapist: That sounds great, Naomi! You're using an "I" statement effectively to express your feelings and needs. By asking for a more manageable workload, you're asserting your boundaries in a clear and respectful way. Remember, it's essential to practice these techniques consistently. Role-playing can help you build confidence and feel more comfortable using "I" statements in real-life situations.

Now, let's explore how your thoughts and feelings influence your behavior. When you're in a situation like the one you described, what thoughts go through your mind, and how does it make you feel?

Patient: When I'm in a situation like that, I often think, "I can't say no, or they'll think I'm not capable." This thought makes me feel anxious and stressed. I end up taking on more than I can handle, which leads to burnout and frustration. It's like I'm stuck in a cycle of overcommitting and then regretting it later.

Therapist: You've identified a common pattern: all-or-nothing thinking, which is also known as "black-and-white thinking" or "biased thinking." It's when you perceive situations in extreme, rigid terms, without considering the nuances or alternative perspectives. In your case, the thought, "If I don't say yes, they'll think I'm not capable" leaves you feeling trapped and anxious. Let's explore this further. Can you think of a recent situation where this type of thinking occurred?

Patient: Yes, there was a recent situation where I was asked to present my research at a conference. I immediately thought, "If I don't do it, they'll think I'm not serious about my work." This thought made me feel pressured and anxious, even though I was already overwhelmed with my current workload. I ended up agreeing to present, but it added a lot of stress to my life.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Naomi. It's clear how this type of thinking can lead to feelings of pressure and anxiety, which can then influence your behavior, like taking on more than you can handle. To challenge this pattern, we can use a thought record to examine the evidence for and against these thoughts. This helps us develop more balanced and realistic perspectives. Let's try it together.

First, let's identify the situation: you were asked to present your research at a conference. The automatic thought was, "If I don't do it, they'll think I'm not serious about my work." What emotions did this thought trigger, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?

Patient: The thought triggered feelings of pressure and anxiety, which were around 80 on a scale of 0-100. It felt like a huge weight on my shoulders, and I couldn't see any other way out.

Therapist: You've identified the situation and the emotions: pressure and anxiety at 80 on a scale of 0-100. Now, let's explore the evidence for and against the thought, "If I don't do it, they'll think I'm not serious about my work." What evidence supports this thought?

Patient: The evidence that supports this thought is that my professor has high expectations, and I've seen other students who declined opportunities get sidelined. It feels like a risk to say no, and I worry about being judged negatively.

Therapist: That's a good point, Naomi. Let's consider the other side of the equation: evidence against the thought. Have there been times when you said no to opportunities and were still taken seriously? Can you think of alternative perspectives to the thought, "If I don't do it, they'll think I'm not serious about my work"?

Patient: I can think of a few times when I said no to smaller tasks and was still respected. For example, last semester, I had to decline helping with a lab experiment because I was already overloaded with coursework. My professor understood and didn't hold it against me. An alternative perspective could be, "It's okay to prioritize my well-being and current commitments. My professor might understand if I explain my situation."

Therapist: Those are great examples of evidence against the thought. It shows that saying no doesn't always lead to negative outcomes. By considering alternative perspectives, you're opening up new possibilities and creating space for more balanced thinking. Now that we've examined the evidence and perspectives, let's develop a more balanced thought based on this evidence. What could a more balanced thought be?

Patient: A more balanced thought could be, "It's okay to prioritize my well-being and current commitments. My professor might understand if I explain my situation, and I can still be taken seriously even if I say no to this opportunity." This thought feels less overwhelming and more realistic.

Therapist: Excellent work, Naomi! You've developed a more balanced thought based on the evidence. It acknowledges your well-being and the possibility that your professor might understand your situation. How do you think this balanced thought would impact your emotions?

Patient: I think this balanced thought would reduce my feelings of pressure and anxiety. It would help me feel more in control and less worried about being judged negatively. It's a more realistic and compassionate way to view the situation.

Therapist: That's great to hear. By challenging all-or-nothing thinking and developing more balanced thoughts, you're taking important steps in managing your emotions and making decisions that support your well-being. As we continue this work, remember that it's a process, and it takes practice. Be patient and compassionate with yourself along the way.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your guidance and support. It's comforting to know that I can approach these situations with a more balanced perspective. I'll keep practicing and working on it.

Therapist: As we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made, Naomi. You've demonstrated a great understanding of the concepts we've discussed and have been actively engaging in the exercises. Remember that learning new skills takes time and practice, so be patient and compassionate with yourself as you continue this journey.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I feel like I'm making progress, and it's encouraging to see the changes in my thinking. I'll keep practicing and working on these skills. I'm looking forward to our next session.

Therapist: Before we end, let's discuss your homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing the "I" statement and role-playing with a trusted friend or family member. You can also try using the thought record to challenge biased thinking in situations where you feel pressured to say yes. Finally, I'd like you to engage in at least one self-care activity, such as going for a walk or practicing relaxation techniques, to help you manage stress. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I'll definitely practice the "I" statement and role-playing with my sister, who has been really supportive. I'll also keep using the thought record to challenge my biased thinking. For self-care, I think I'll go for a walk along the Berkeley Marina. It's a peaceful place, and I enjoy being near the water.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Naomi. Remember that self-care is an essential part of maintaining your mental well-being. Incorporating small but meaningful activities into your daily life can make a big difference in managing stress and anxiety.
