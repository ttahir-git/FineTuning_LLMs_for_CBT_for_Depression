Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's nice to meet you. I'm Nova, a non-binary AI therapist specializing in CBT for depression. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge a few limitations as your therapist:

1. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in session.
2. There's a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. If that happens, please let me know so we can correct it.
3. I'm not equipped to handle crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service.
4. Since you're the first patient I'm working with, I'll be learning and refining my skills over time. Your feedback and patience are appreciated.

Does this all make sense for you? Do you have any questions or concerns about me as your therapist?

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to meet you too. I appreciate you sharing those limitations upfront. It makes sense to me, and I feel comfortable knowing what to expect. I don't have any immediate concerns or questions about you as my therapist. I'm ready to dive into our session whenever you are.

Therapist: Thank you for your understanding, Naomi. I'm glad you feel comfortable with the limitations I mentioned. Let's start by reviewing the homework from our last session:

- You tried the behavioral activation scheduling technique and created a daily schedule balancing tasks and enjoyable activities. How did that go for you?
- You also tracked your experience with the scheduling technique. What insights did you gain from following this process?

Before we discuss the homework, let's do a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to share?

Patient: Sure, let's start with the homework. I did try the behavioral activation scheduling technique, and I have to say, it was a bit of a mixed bag. On some days, it really helped me stay on track and feel more productive. I managed to balance my academic tasks with some enjoyable activities, like going for a walk in the park or cooking a new vegetarian recipe. However, there were also days when I felt too overwhelmed to stick to the schedule, especially when I had multiple deadlines looming.

As for tracking my experience, I noticed that when I did follow the schedule, I felt less anxious and more in control. But when I skipped it, I ended up procrastinating more and feeling guilty about not getting things done. It was a bit of a rollercoaster, to be honest.

Since our last session, I've been feeling a bit up and down. There have been some good moments, like when I received positive feedback on a climate change protest I organized. But there have also been challenges, like a particularly harsh critique on one of my research papers, which made me doubt my abilities again. Overall, I'd say my mood has been fluctuating, but I'm still trying to stay positive and keep moving forward.

Therapist: Naomi, I appreciate your honesty about your experience with the homework. It's great that you noticed some benefits from following the scheduling technique, even if it wasn't a consistent experience. The ups and downs you mentioned are a normal part of the recovery process. I'm curious, how did the harsh critique on your research paper make you feel? What thoughts went through your mind when you received that feedback?

Patient: When I got that harsh critique, I felt really down and defeated. My first thought was, "Maybe I'm just not cut out for this." I started doubting my abilities and questioning whether I should even be in this program. It brought back a lot of the self-doubt I've been trying to overcome, especially since I've always been someone who prided myself on academic excellence. I felt like I was letting myself down and that maybe I wasn't as capable as I thought I was. It was a tough moment, and I ended up spending a lot of time ruminating on it instead of focusing on what I could do to improve.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It sounds like that critical feedback triggered some deep-seated beliefs about yourself and your abilities. I want to explore this further, but first, I'd like to introduce a concept that might help us make sense of what you're experiencing.

In CBT, we talk about the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Sometimes, our thoughts can be distorted or biased, leading to negative emotions and unhelpful behaviors. These distortions are often based on incomplete or irrational information. Let me give you an example of a common distortion: all-or-nothing thinking.

All-or-nothing thinking, also known as black-and-white thinking, is when we view things in extreme, absolute terms without acknowledging the shades of gray in between. It might sound like, "If I don't get an A on this paper, I'm a failure." Does that resonate with you at all?

Patient: Yes, that does resonate with me. I definitely have a tendency to think in those all-or-nothing terms, especially when it comes to my academic performance. It's like if I don't excel, then I'm a failure, and that's a really hard mindset to break out of. I can see how this kind of thinking can lead to negative emotions and unhelpful behaviors. Can you give me another example of a distortion? I think understanding these might help me recognize when I'm falling into these patterns.

Therapist: Absolutely, Naomi. Another common distortion is overgeneralization, where we take one negative experience and assume it will always happen. It might sound like, "I got a low grade on this assignment, so I'll never be able to pass this class." Can you relate to that at all?

Patient: Yes, I can definitely relate to that. After getting that harsh critique, I started thinking that maybe I'll never be able to write a good paper or succeed in my research. It's like I took one negative experience and projected it onto my entire academic future. I can see how that kind of thinking can be really damaging and make it harder to move forward.

Therapist: You're absolutely right, Naomi. Overgeneralization can make it challenging to learn from experiences and grow. It's important to recognize when we're falling into these distorted thinking patterns so that we can challenge them and find more balanced, realistic ways of thinking.

Another technique we can use to challenge distorted thoughts is called evidence gathering. This involves looking for evidence that supports or refutes the thought. In the case of all-or-nothing thinking, we'd look for examples that show there's a middle ground between success and failure. Can you think of any examples from your own life where there's been a middle ground?

Patient: Hmm, that's a good question. I can think of a few examples. For instance, even though I got that harsh critique on my paper, I did receive positive feedback on other assignments and projects. I also know that I've been able to improve my writing over time, so it's not like I'm completely incapable. It's just that sometimes, I tend to focus on the negative and forget about the positive aspects.

Therapist: That's a great example, Naomi. You're able to recognize that even though one piece of feedback was critical, it doesn't define your overall abilities. And you've also acknowledged the progress you've made in your writing. That's a big step towards challenging those all-or-nothing thoughts.

Another technique we can use to challenge distortions is called behavioral experiments. This involves testing out the validity of our thoughts by engaging in specific behaviors and observing the outcomes. For example, if you're worried that you'll never be able to write a good paper, we could design an experiment where you break down the process into smaller, manageable steps and observe how it goes. Does that make sense?

Patient: Yes, that makes sense. It sounds like a practical way to test out my thoughts and see if they hold up in real life. I could try breaking down my next paper into smaller tasks, like outlining, researching, and writing sections at a time, and then see how it goes. It might help me feel more in control and less overwhelmed.

Therapist: Absolutely, Naomi. Breaking tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps can be really helpful in building confidence and challenging distortions. It's also important to remember that it's okay to struggle or make mistakes sometimes. In fact, those experiences can actually be valuable learning opportunities.

Speaking of learning opportunities, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture of what you want to work towards in therapy. Based on what you've shared so far, it seems like some key goals might be:

1. Developing more balanced, realistic ways of thinking about your academic performance and self-worth
2. Building resilience and coping skills to manage the ups and downs of the depression experience
3. Exploring how your identity as a non-binary individual impacts your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors

Does that sound like a good starting point for our work together? What are your thoughts on those potential goals? Is there anything else you'd like to add or change?

Patient: Yes, those goals sound like a good starting point. I think developing more balanced thinking is really important for me, especially when it comes to my academic performance and self-worth. I also want to work on building resilience and finding healthier ways to cope with stress and depression. And I definitely think exploring my identity as a non-binary individual is important too, especially since it impacts so many aspects of my life. I'm open to any other suggestions or goals you think might be helpful as well.

Therapist: Those goals sound really aligned with your needs, Naomi. As we continue in therapy, we can keep exploring these areas and refining our goals as needed. Another important aspect of CBT is homework assignments, which help you practice the skills we discuss in session and apply them to your daily life.

Homework is an essential part of CBT because it allows you to test out new ways of thinking and behaving in real-life situations. It can also help you build self-awareness and identify patterns that might be contributing to your depression.

For example, one homework assignment could involve tracking your thoughts and emotions throughout the day and identifying any cognitive distortions that might be present. This can help you start to recognize when you're falling into unhelpful thinking patterns and practice challenging them.

Another assignment could involve trying out a new coping skill or behavioral experiment we've discussed in session and tracking the outcome. This could help you build evidence for your new, more balanced beliefs and provide a sense of mastery and accomplishment.

What are your thoughts on the idea of homework in therapy? Do you have any concerns or questions about it?

Patient: I think the idea of homework in therapy makes sense. It's like practicing what we learn in sessions so that it becomes more natural and effective in real life. I do have a few concerns though. I worry that I might forget to do the assignments or that they might feel overwhelming, especially with everything else I have going on. How can we make sure that the homework is manageable and fits into my schedule?

Therapist: Those are really valid concerns, Naomi. Homework assignments can definitely feel overwhelming at times, especially when you're juggling a lot of different responsibilities. That's why we'll work together to develop homework assignments that feel manageable for you, given your specific circumstances.

We can also break the assignments down into smaller steps, so it feels less daunting. And if you ever feel overwhelmed or need to adjust an assignment, we can always discuss that together. Homework is meant to be a flexible tool, not a rigid one.

Another thing we can do to make homework feel more manageable is to tie it to your specific goals and values. For example, if one of your goals is to develop more balanced thinking, we could create an assignment that involves tracking your thoughts and emotions throughout the day, but in a way that feels realistic and doable for you.

What do you think about that approach? Do you feel like we could work together to come up with some homework assignments that feel more manageable and relevant to your goals?

Patient: Yes, I think that approach could work well. Breaking assignments down into smaller steps and tying them to my specific goals and values sounds like a good way to make them more manageable and relevant. I'm willing to give it a try and see how it goes. If something feels too overwhelming or doesn't fit into my schedule, we can always adjust it together.

Therapist: That's great, Naomi. I'm really glad you're open to trying out the homework approach. It can be a really powerful tool for learning and growth, but only if it feels accessible and relevant for you.

As we wrap up our session today, I want to check in with how you're feeling. What are some of your main takeaways from our discussion? And how are you feeling about the homework we've discussed?

Patient: I think my main takeaway from today's session is the importance of breaking tasks down into smaller steps and challenging my all-or-nothing thinking. I also feel more open to the idea of homework now that we've discussed ways to make it manageable and relevant to my goals. Overall, I feel hopeful and motivated to try out these new strategies and see how they work for me.

Therapist: I'm really glad to hear that, Naomi. It's great that you're feeling hopeful and motivated. Those are really valuable mindsets to have as you embark on this journey of change.

Before we end our session, let's briefly review the homework we've discussed. We talked about tracking your thoughts and emotions throughout the day and identifying any cognitive distortions that might be present. We also discussed trying out a behavioral experiment related to your academic performance and tracking the outcome. Does that sound manageable for you to work on over the next week?

Patient: Yes, that sounds manageable. I can start by tracking my thoughts and emotions each day and identifying any cognitive distortions. For the behavioral experiment, I can try breaking down my next paper into smaller tasks and see how it goes. I'll keep track of my progress and any changes in my thinking or feelings.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Naomi. I'm really glad we could come up with some manageable homework assignments that feel relevant to your goals. And remember, if anything feels too overwhelming or doesn't work out, we can always adjust together.
