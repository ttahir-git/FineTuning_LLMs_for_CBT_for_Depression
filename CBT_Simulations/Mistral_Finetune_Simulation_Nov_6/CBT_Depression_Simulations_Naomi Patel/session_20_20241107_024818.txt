Therapist: Naomi, it takes a lot of courage to share these struggles. Remember that setbacks don't erase your progress, they provide opportunities for growth. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Before we dive in, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's been tough, but I'm trying to keep moving forward. For today, I think I want to focus on managing my perfectionism and academic pressure better. It's been really overwhelming lately, and I feel like I'm constantly on edge. I also want to talk about how to handle those difficult phone calls with my parents without letting them spiral into something worse.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan, Naomi. We can definitely focus on strategies to manage your perfectionism and academic stress, as well as tools to cope with challenging interactions with your parents. Let's start by exploring the recent setback you mentioned earlier. Can you tell me more about what happened and how it affected you?

Patient: Sure. It was a few nights ago when I was working on a research project that's due soon. I was feeling really stressed because I wasn't making as much progress as I wanted to, and I started to feel like a failure. I ended up cutting myself, which I know is not a healthy way to cope. Afterward, I felt even more ashamed and guilty. It's like I can't escape this cycle of feeling like I'm not good enough, no matter what I do.

Therapist: Naomi, I hear you, and I want to emphasize that what you're experiencing is not your fault. The cycle of self-criticism and self-harm is a common response to perfectionistic thoughts and unrealistic expectations. Let's take a closer look at the thoughts that were going through your mind during that stressful night. Can you recall any specific negative thoughts about yourself?

Patient: Yeah, I remember thinking things like, "I'm never going to finish this on time," "I'm not smart enough to do this," and "I'm letting everyone down." It's like my mind just keeps spiraling into these negative thoughts, and I can't seem to stop it.

Therapist: That's a great observation, Naomi. These negative thoughts are likely cognitive distortions, which are inaccurate or exaggerated thought patterns that can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety. One common distortion is "catastrophizing," where we imagine the worst possible outcome without evidence. Another is "all-or-nothing thinking," where we see things in black-and-white terms, like "I'm not smart enough." 

Let's try to challenge these thoughts using an evidence-based approach. We'll look for evidence that supports or refutes these negative thoughts. For example, can you think of any times when you've successfully completed a project or received positive feedback on your work?

Patient: Hmm, well, I did manage to finish a big project last semester on time, and my advisor gave me some positive feedback. I also remember getting an A on a paper that I thought was going to be a disaster. So, I guess there is some evidence that I can do this, even if it doesn't feel like it right now.

Therapist: That's great, Naomi! You're already starting to challenge those negative thoughts with evidence. This is a skill we can continue to practice, along with using self-compassion techniques, like perspective-taking. How do you think you could respond to a friend who was having similar thoughts about not being good enough?

Patient: I think I'd tell them that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that they're doing their best. I'd remind them of their past successes and encourage them to take breaks and ask for help when they need it. I guess I need to start treating myself the same way.

Therapist: Absolutely, Naomi! That's a wonderful insight. Practicing self-compassion can be challenging, but it's a crucial part of managing perfectionism and reducing self-harm. Let's add this to our agenda for today - exploring ways to apply self-compassion when you're feeling overwhelmed or self-critical.

Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about those difficult phone calls with your parents. It sounds like they can be a significant source of stress and trigger negative thoughts. What do you think are some of the most challenging aspects of these conversations?

Patient: The hardest part is feeling like I have to constantly justify my identity and choices to them. They keep asking me why I can't just be "normal" and why I have to make things so complicated. It's exhausting, and I end up feeling like I'm disappointing them no matter what I say.

Therapist: Naomi, I can imagine how draining it must be to constantly defend your identity and choices to them. It's not fair that you should have to justify yourself just to receive acceptance and understanding. Let's explore some strategies for setting boundaries and managing these conversations more effectively.

One technique that can be helpful is using "I" statements to express your thoughts and feelings while avoiding blame or judgment. For example, instead of saying, "You make me feel like a disappointment," you could say, "I feel overwhelmed and invalidated when we discuss my identity." This approach can help keep the conversation focused on your feelings and experiences, rather than getting caught up in defense or attack.

Another strategy is to practice active listening, which means fully focusing on what the other person is saying and reflecting it back to them, without interruption or judgment. This can help reduce misunderstandings and invalidation, and promote a deeper level of understanding.

What do you think about trying these techniques next time you have a phone call with your parents?

Patient: I think trying "I" statements could be really helpful. It might make it easier to express how I'm feeling without sounding confrontational. And active listening might help me understand where they're coming from, even if I don't agree with them. I'll give it a try next time we talk.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Naomi. Remember, it's okay if these strategies don't work perfectly at first. It takes practice to change long-standing communication patterns. The important thing is that you're taking steps to prioritize your own needs and emotional well-being in these conversations.

As we continue to work on managing perfectionism, academic stress, and challenging interactions with your parents, let's also keep in mind the connections between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. For example, when you're feeling overwhelmed and self-critical, it can trigger thoughts like "I'm not good enough," which leads to feelings of shame and guilt, and then behaviors like avoiding challenges or engaging in self-harm.

By challenging those thoughts and practicing self-compassion, we can start to break that cycle and create new, more helpful thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It's a process, but every small step counts.

What thoughts and feelings come up for you as we explore these concepts? How do you see them connecting to your experiences and relationships?

Patient: I think the thoughts and feelings definitely connect to how I handle stress and relationships. When I start thinking "I'm not good enough," it makes me feel like I'm failing at everything, and that leads to avoiding things or hurting myself. It's like a vicious cycle that I can't seem to break out of. But if I can start challenging those thoughts and being kinder to myself, maybe I can start feeling better and handling things differently.

Therapist: You're absolutely right, Naomi. The connections between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are at the core of CBT. It's a process of recognizing those patterns and learning to interrupt them in a more helpful way. And you're already making great strides in that direction.

Let's practice challenging some of those negative thoughts right now. Can you think of a specific situation recently where you felt like you were failing or not good enough?

Patient: Sure, there was this one time when I was working on a research proposal for my thesis. I kept second-guessing every word I wrote, and I ended up staying up all night to finish it. When I finally submitted it, I felt like it was still not good enough, even though my advisor said it was fine.

Therapist: Okay, let's break that down. What was the situation? What thoughts and feelings came up for you?

Patient: The situation was working on my thesis proposal. The thoughts were things like "This isn't good enough," "I'm going to fail," and "I'm not smart enough." The feelings were stress, anxiety, and a sense of dread.

Therapist: And what about the behavior - what did you do in response to those thoughts and feelings?

Patient: I stayed up all night working on it, even though I was exhausted. And after I submitted it, I felt like I couldn't relax or enjoy anything because I was still worried about it.

Therapist: That's a great analysis, Naomi. Now, let's challenge some of those thoughts using the evidence-based approach we talked about earlier. What evidence do you have that your proposal wasn't good enough or that you would fail?

Patient: Well, my advisor said it was fine, and they didn't ask for any revisions. So, there's evidence that it was good enough. But I still can't shake the feeling that it wasn't perfect.

Therapist: That's a great observation. Perfectionism can be a really tricky thing, because it's always looking for reasons to say "not good enough." But the fact that your advisor said it was fine is pretty solid evidence that it was good enough for the purpose it was meant to serve.

Let's look at the other thoughts - "I'm going to fail" and "I'm not smart enough." What evidence do you have for those thoughts?

Patient: For "I'm going to fail," I don't have any evidence because I haven't failed yet. And for "I'm not smart enough," I've been able to complete my coursework and get good grades so far, so that's evidence against it.

Therapist: Exactly. And those are great examples of using evidence to challenge negative thoughts. It's not about being perfect, it's about being realistic and looking at the facts.

Now, let's talk about some alternative thoughts that might be more helpful. What could be a more balanced thought about your thesis proposal?

Patient: Maybe something like, "My proposal was good enough to meet the requirements, and I can always improve it later if needed."

Therapist: That's a great alternative thought, Naomi. It acknowledges that the proposal was good enough, but it also leaves room for growth and change. How does that thought feel compared to the original negative one?

Patient: It feels a bit more reassuring, like I'm not doomed to fail just because it wasn't perfect. But it's still hard to fully believe it.

Therapist: That's okay. Challenging long-held thoughts takes practice, and it's not always easy. The key is to keep doing it, even if it feels a little uncomfortable at first. With time, it will start to feel more natural and automatic.

Now, let's talk about what you could do differently in the future when you start feeling like you're not good enough. What are some self-compassionate thoughts or behaviors that might be helpful?

Patient: I could remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that I'm doing my best. And maybe take a break when I start feeling overwhelmed, instead of pushing myself too hard.

Therapist: Those are both great ideas, Naomi. Taking breaks when you need them is a really important part of managing stress and avoiding burnout. And practicing self-compassion, like reminding yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're doing your best, can really help shift those negative thoughts.

Remember, it's not about getting rid of negative thoughts altogether - everyone has them sometimes. It's about having a toolbox of strategies to manage them in a healthier way.

Patient: Yeah, I guess I need to keep building that toolbox. It's just frustrating when I feel like I'm not making progress fast enough.

Therapist: It's completely normal to feel frustrated at times, Naomi. Learning new skills and changing long-standing patterns takes time and practice. And you're doing a great job of building that toolbox, even if it doesn't always feel like it in the moment.

Let's take a step back and look at the progress you've made so far in therapy. What are some of the skills and insights you've gained that you feel proud of?

Patient: I've started to recognize when I'm spiraling into negative thoughts and I've been trying to challenge them more. And I've also been more open with my friends about what I'm going through, which has helped a lot.

Therapist: Those are both huge accomplishments, Naomi. Recognizing negative thought patterns and challenging them is a core skill in CBT, and it takes a lot of practice to build that skill. And reaching out to friends for support is a great example of building a support system and practicing vulnerability, which can be really powerful in managing depression.

What do you think about doing some role-playing to practice these skills in session? We could pretend I'm a friend and you can practice sharing what you've been struggling with and challenging negative thoughts.

Patient: That sounds like a good idea. I think it could help me feel more prepared to talk about these things in real life. Let's do it.

Therapist: Great idea, Naomi. Let's try it. Imagine I'm your friend, and you want to talk about what you've been going through with the stress of school and feeling like you're not good enough. What might you say to me?

Patient: Hey, I've been feeling really overwhelmed with school lately. I keep thinking I'm not good enough, and it's been really hard to focus. I just wanted to talk about it because I know I can't keep it all inside.

Therapist: I'm really glad you reached out, Naomi. It takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable like this. What thoughts and feelings come up for you when you say these things to me?

Patient: I feel a bit nervous, like I'm exposing a part of myself that I usually keep hidden. But at the same time, it feels good to get it out and know that I'm not alone in feeling this way.

Therapist: That's a really common feeling when we open up to others, Naomi. It can be scary to be vulnerable, but it's also a powerful way to connect with others and realize you're not alone. How do you think I could respond in this situation to support you?

Patient: Maybe you could just listen and let me know that it's okay to feel this way, and that I'm not alone in struggling with these thoughts and feelings.

Therapist: Absolutely, Naomi. Validating the experience and letting someone know they're not alone can be incredibly powerful. It says, "I hear you, and you're not in this alone." 

You could also ask questions to understand more about what's going on for them and explore any specific challenges they're facing. That can help you better understand how to support them and offer specific help.

Patient: That makes sense. I guess I could ask you what's been the hardest part lately or if there's anything specific that's been triggering these feelings.

Therapist: That's a great question, Naomi. It can help you get a clearer picture of what's been going on and identify any specific stressors or triggers. And if you're able to identify those things, you can work together to find ways to cope or problem-solve.

What about offering some encouragement or hope? That can be really helpful when someone's feeling down or overwhelmed.

Patient: Yeah, that could be helpful too. Maybe I could remind you of a time when you overcame something difficult and how that gives you hope for getting through this too.

Therapist: Absolutely, Naomi. Reminding someone of their strengths, resilience, and past successes can be a powerful way to give them hope and encouragement. It can help them remember that they have the ability to cope and get through tough times.

Another thing you could offer is practical support, like brainstorming concrete steps they could take to feel better or asking if there's anything you could do to help. That could be something like going for a walk together or making a healthy meal.

Patient: That sounds really supportive. I think I could offer to help with some of your schoolwork or just be there to listen if you need to vent.
