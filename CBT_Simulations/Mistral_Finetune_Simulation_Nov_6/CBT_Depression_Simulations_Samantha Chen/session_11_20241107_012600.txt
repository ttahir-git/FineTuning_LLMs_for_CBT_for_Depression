Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again for our 11th CBT session. I understand that battling perfectionism is an ongoing challenge for you, especially when it comes to your design work. Perfectionism can often lead to negative self-talk and unrealistic standards, which can impact both your productivity and emotional well-being.

In our last session, we focused on cognitive restructuring and behavioral experiments as tools to help you challenge your perfectionistic thoughts. I'm curious to know how you've been applying these techniques since our last meeting. How has your sleep and anxiety been?

Patient: Hi Nova. It's good to be back. I've been trying to apply those cognitive restructuring techniques, but it's been a bit of a mixed bag. Some days I can catch myself when I start spiraling into negative self-talk about my designs, but other days it feels like I'm right back where I started. 

Sleep has been a bit better, though. I've been making a conscious effort to stick to a bedtime routine, and I think that's helping. I still have nights where I wake up and can't fall back asleep, but overall, it's an improvement. Anxiety, on the other hand, is still pretty high. I've been feeling really overwhelmed with everything lately, especially with the business.

Therapist: I appreciate your honesty, Samantha. It's common for progress to feel inconsistent when learning new skills like cognitive restructuring. The fact that you're noticing your negative self-talk and attempting to challenge it is a significant step forward. It's also great to hear that you've been implementing a bedtime routine to help with sleep. Even small changes can make a difference.

Regarding your anxiety, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. Running a business can be stressful, especially when you're wearing multiple hats. Let's make sure to address this in our session today.

For our agenda, I'd like to suggest we:
1. Review your thought records and discuss any challenges or successes you've had with cognitive restructuring.
2. Explore your experiences with behavioral experiments and discuss any insights or lessons learned.
3. Identify strategies for managing work-related stress and anxiety.
4. Check in on your progress with sleep hygiene and discuss any modifications we might make to your bedtime routine.

Does this sound like a helpful plan for our time together today? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I've been keeping up with the thought records, and I think they've helped me see some patterns in my thinking. I've noticed that a lot of my negative self-talk is about not being good enough or that my designs aren't perfect. It's been tough to challenge those thoughts, but I'm trying.

As for the behavioral experiments, I did show one of my designs to a friend who's not in the fashion industry. She really liked it and didn't notice any of the flaws I was worried about. That was a bit of a relief, but I still find myself second-guessing everything.

I'm open to discussing strategies for managing work-related stress and anxiety. It feels like there's always something new to worry about with the business, and it's hard to keep up sometimes.

I think that covers everything for now. Let's dive in.

Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your thought records. It's great that you've been noticing patterns in your negative self-talk, Samantha. Recognizing these patterns is an important first step in challenging perfectionistic thoughts. Can you share an example of a situation where you found yourself fixating on not being good enough or perfectionistic thoughts about your designs?

Patient: Sure, Nova. One recent example was when I was working on a new collection for GreenThread. I had spent weeks perfecting a dress design, but when I finally showed it to my partner, Michael, he pointed out a small seam that wasn't quite straight. I immediately started thinking, "I'm not good enough. This is going to ruin the whole collection. No one will want to buy it."

I wrote it down in my thought record, and I tried to challenge those thoughts by reminding myself that most people probably wouldn't even notice the seam, and that it's a small detail in a much larger collection. But it was still hard to shake off that feeling of failure.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Samantha. I can understand how that small comment from Michael might have triggered those feelings of inadequacy and catastrophizing. The fact that you were able to recognize and write down those thoughts is a significant step forward.

One technique we can use to challenge those thoughts further is to look for evidence that contradicts them. In this case, the evidence might include the fact that Michael himself pointed out the seam, suggesting that he cares about the quality of your work, and that you've received positive feedback from customers in the past.

Another point to consider is that everyone makes mistakes, and a small imperfection in one piece doesn't necessarily mean the entire collection is ruined. It's important to separate your self-worth from your work.

How do you feel about applying those points to challenge your initial thoughts?

Patient: I see what you're saying, Nova. It's true that Michael cares about the quality of my work, and he's usually very supportive. And I have gotten positive feedback from customers before, so it's not like this one mistake is going to ruin everything.

But it's still hard for me to separate my self-worth from my work. I feel like if I'm not perfect, then I'm failing not just myself, but my family and everyone who's invested in GreenThread. It's a lot of pressure.

Therapist: I hear you, Samantha. It's understandable that you feel a lot of pressure to be perfect, especially when you're in charge of a business that employs others. However, I want to emphasize that perfectionism is a form of all-or-nothing thinking, which is a cognitive distortion. It's not realistic or fair to yourself to expect perfection all the time.

Let's try another experiment. I want you to think about a time when you received positive feedback or praise for your work. It can be about a project or a piece that you felt very good about. What thoughts came up for you in that moment?

Patient: When I received positive feedback, I usually felt a sense of relief and pride. For example, when I launched my first collection and got great reviews from customers and fashion bloggers, I felt like all the hard work had paid off. I remember thinking, "I did it. This is what I was meant to do."

But then, as soon as the praise died down, I would start worrying about the next collection and whether I could live up to those expectations again. It's like I can't just enjoy the moment without thinking about what comes next.

Therapist: That's a great observation, Samantha. This tendency to discount positive experiences and focus on potential flaws or future challenges is another cognitive distortion called "disqualifying the positive." It's like you're throwing away the good stuff and only focusing on the negative.

The fact that you have those positive experiences in the first place is important to acknowledge. It shows that you have the ability to create great work and that others value your designs. I'm curious, what do you think might happen if you tried to hold onto those positive feelings a bit longer, instead of dismissing them right away?

Patient: I guess if I held onto those positive feelings, I might feel more confident going into the next project. It could help me see that I'm capable of creating something people love, even if there are small imperfections.

But it's hard for me to trust those feelings, Nova. I've always been taught to focus on what's wrong and fix it, rather than celebrate what's right. It feels almost wrong to enjoy the praise without immediately thinking about how to improve.

Therapist: That's a common concern, Samantha. Many people who struggle with perfectionism feel like they can only trust the critical voice in their heads. It's like they've been conditioned to dismiss positive experiences as flukes or exceptions.

One way to start bridging that trust gap is to intentionally focus on the evidence that supports your abilities and achievements. This is where the concept of a "positive data log" can be helpful. Basically, it's a place where you record any positive feedback, accomplishments, or moments of pride in your career or personal life. The log helps you build up a balanced perspective of yourself, one that includes both the flaws and the strengths.

What do you think about starting a positive data log this week? We could set aside a few minutes at the end of each day to reflect on any positive experiences and write them down.

Patient: That sounds like a good idea, Nova. I think keeping a positive data log could help me see more clearly that I do have strengths and that I'm capable of creating something people appreciate.

I'll start doing that this week and bring it to our next session. It might feel a bit strange at first, but I'm willing to give it a try.

Therapist: I'm glad you're open to trying the positive data log, Samantha. It can definitely feel unnatural at first, especially if you're used to discounting positive experiences. But the more you practice, the more it will start to feel like a habit.

In addition to the positive data log, I want to introduce another technique called "behavioral activation." It's a way of scheduling activities that give you a sense of pleasure, mastery, or accomplishment, even if you don't feel like doing them in the moment. The idea is that by engaging in these activities, you can start to shift your mood and build up positive momentum.

For example, one of your activities might be working on a creative project that gives you a sense of mastery. Another might be engaging in a hobby like gardening that provides a sense of pleasure. The key is to plan ahead and commit to the activity, even if you don't feel motivated in the moment.

What are your thoughts on this technique, Samantha? Do you have any ideas for activities that could give you a sense of pleasure, mastery, or accomplishment?

Patient: Behavioral activation sounds interesting, Nova. I think it could be helpful to have a plan for activities that I enjoy, even when I'm not feeling motivated.

For pleasure, I could spend some time in my organic garden. It's something I love doing, and it always helps me relax and feel more grounded. For mastery, I could work on a new sustainable fashion design. Even if it's just sketching out ideas, it gives me a sense of accomplishment and keeps my creative juices flowing.

I'll start planning those activities for this week and see how it goes.

Therapist: Those sound like great activities, Samantha! Gardening is a wonderful way to find a sense of pleasure, and sketching new designs can definitely provide a sense of mastery. I'm glad you're willing to give behavioral activation a try.

Remember, the goal is to schedule these activities at times when you're not feeling particularly motivated. That way, you can use the activities to boost your mood, rather than waiting for motivation to strike.

As you engage in these activities, I want you to pay attention to how you feel. Notice any shifts in your mood or energy levels, and write them down in your positive data log. This will help you see the impact that engaging in pleasant or mastery activities can have on your overall well-being.

In our next session, we can review your positive data log and discuss any insights or challenges that came up as you worked on behavioral activation.

Patient: That makes sense, Nova. I'll make sure to schedule those activities even when I don't feel like doing them and keep track of how I feel afterward.

I'm looking forward to seeing the impact it has on my mood and energy levels. It's been hard to find joy in things lately, so I hope this helps.

Therapist: I'm confident that engaging in more activities that bring you a sense of pleasure and mastery will help improve your overall mood and energy, Samantha. Remember, it's okay to start small and build up gradually. Even a few minutes of an enjoyable activity can make a difference.

As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling. What are your main takeaways from our discussion, and how are you feeling about the homework assignments we've discussed?

Patient: My main takeaway is that I need to be more intentional about focusing on the positive aspects of my life and work, rather than just the negative. Starting the positive data log and scheduling activities for pleasure and mastery are good steps in that direction.

I'm feeling a bit apprehensive about the homework, to be honest. It feels a bit overwhelming to add more to my plate right now. But I also know that I need to make these changes to feel better, so I'm willing to give it a try.

Therapist: It's completely understandable to feel apprehensive about adding more to your plate, Samantha. That's a very common reaction when you're already dealing with a lot. The important thing is that you're aware of your limits and willing to start small.

Remember, the goal is not to do everything perfectly, but rather to take steps in the right direction. If you find yourself struggling with an activity, that's okay. Just note the difficulty in your positive data log and move on to the next one.

I'm here to support you throughout this process, and we can adjust the homework as needed. The most important thing is that you're making progress, even if it's small.

In the meantime, let's review your homework for the week. You'll:
- Continue practicing thought records, focusing on challenging perfectionistic thoughts and discounting the positive.
- Start a positive data log to record any positive experiences, accomplishments, or moments of pride in your career or personal life.
- Schedule activities for pleasure, such as gardening, and mastery, such as sketching, even when you don't feel motivated.
- Continue practicing the progressive muscle relaxation technique before bed to improve your sleep hygiene.

Does that sound manageable? Do you have any questions about the homework?

Patient: That sounds manageable, Nova. I'll do my best to stick to the plan and keep track of how it's going.

I do have a question about the thought records. Sometimes, it's hard for me to come up with alternative thoughts that feel believable. Do you have any tips for making those more convincing?

Therapist: That's a great question, Samantha! Coming up with alternative thoughts can be challenging, especially when the negative thoughts feel so deeply ingrained. One strategy is to imagine what you would say to a friend who expressed similar thoughts. We're often much kinder and more objective with others than we are with ourselves.

Another technique is to focus on developing more balanced and nuanced thoughts rather than trying to completely dismiss the negative ones. For example, instead of trying to believe that your work is perfect, you might acknowledge that it's not flawless but that you did a good job overall.

It can also be helpful to remind yourself of the evidence that contradicts the negative thoughts. In this case, you might think back to times when you've received positive feedback on your work, or times when you've overcome challenges and made progress.

If you're still struggling, it can be helpful to write down a few alternative thoughts, even if they don't feel completely convincing at first. With practice, it will get easier to generate more balanced thoughts.

Remember, the goal is not to eliminate negative thoughts entirely, but rather to develop a more balanced perspective. Even small shifts in your thinking can make a big difference in how you feel.

Do those tips resonate with you, Samantha? Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up today's session?

Patient: Those tips make sense, Nova. I think imagining what I would say to a friend is a good way to approach it. I'll try to be more balanced in my thoughts and focus on the evidence that supports my strengths and accomplishments.

I think that's all for today. I'll work on the homework and see you next week.

Therapist: I'm glad those tips resonated with you, Samantha. Remember, it's okay to start small and build up gradually. The fact that you're making an effort and being more mindful of your thoughts and activities is a significant step forward.

Take care this week, and I look forward to hearing about your progress at our next session.
