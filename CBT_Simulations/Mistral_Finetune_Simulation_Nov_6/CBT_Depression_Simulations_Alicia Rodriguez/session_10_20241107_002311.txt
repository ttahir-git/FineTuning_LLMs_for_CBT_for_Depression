Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again for our 10th session together. I appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences with me. Before we dive into today's topics, let's do a thorough check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to be here again. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice those self-compassion techniques, but it's been a bit of a mixed bag. I managed to write a self-compassionate letter, which felt strange at first, but it did help me see things from a different perspective. I've also set up phone reminders for relaxation breaks, but I find myself ignoring them sometimes because I get so caught up in work. 

On the positive side, I've noticed a slight improvement in my sleep quality, which is a relief. However, work has been really intense lately, especially with a big project deadline looming. I've been feeling the pressure to perform perfectly, and it's starting to take a toll on me. I've had a few headaches and moments where I just feel completely overwhelmed.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alicia. It's great that you've made progress with the self-compassion techniques, even if it feels a bit uncomfortable at times. And it's encouraging to hear about the slight improvement in your sleep quality. However, I understand that work stress can be a significant challenge, especially with the added pressure of perfectionism.

Let's explore those headaches and moments of feeling overwhelmed a bit more. Can you tell me about a specific instance when you felt this way? Let's break it down using the CBT triangle to help us understand the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that were at play.

Patient: Sure, I can give you an example. Last week, I was reviewing code for a critical part of our project, and I found a small error. It wasn't a major issue, but it triggered this intense wave of anxiety. I started thinking, "What if this mistake leads to a bigger problem? What if my team loses trust in me?" These thoughts made me feel really anxious and overwhelmed. 

As a result, I ended up spending hours trying to fix the error, even though it could have been resolved much quicker. I also avoided talking to my team about it because I didn't want them to see me as anything less than perfect. This avoidance made me feel even more isolated and stressed.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Alicia. It's a great illustration of how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can interact to create a cycle of anxiety and stress. The situation with the code error triggered the thought, "What if this mistake leads to a bigger problem?" which then led to feelings of anxiety and the behavior of spending excessive time trying to fix the error.

Let's look at that thought more closely. It seems to be an example of a cognitive distortion called "catastrophizing," where we assume the worst possible outcome without evidence. Can you think of a more balanced or realistic way to view that situation?

Patient: Hmm, I see what you mean about catastrophizing. A more balanced thought might be, "It's normal to make small errors, and I can learn from this to prevent future issues." Instead of assuming the worst, I could focus on the fact that I caught the error and fixed it, which shows my attention to detail and responsibility. 

But I guess the challenge is convincing myself of that when I'm in the middle of feeling overwhelmed. How do I actually start believing these more balanced thoughts when I'm in that anxious state?

Therapist: That's a great question, Alicia. It's definitely challenging to shift our thoughts in those moments of intense emotions. One technique we can use is called "thought stopping" – it's a way to interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and replace them with something more helpful.

Here's how it works: When you notice yourself having a strong emotion, take a moment to identify the thoughts behind it. Then, say "stop" to yourself, either out loud or in your head. This helps break the connection between the trigger and the thought.

Next, consciously focus on a different thought, such as one of those more balanced or realistic thoughts we discussed earlier. You can even write these down on a coping card to have ready. The key is to practice this technique regularly, even when you're not in a highly emotional state, to make it easier to use when you need it most.

What do you think about giving this a try? It can take some practice, but it can be a powerful way to change the way we think and feel in the moment.

Patient: That makes sense. I can see how interrupting the negative thoughts with a "stop" command could help break the cycle. I'll try writing down some of those balanced thoughts on a coping card and practice using the "stop" technique. 

I guess the challenge will be remembering to do it when I'm in the middle of feeling anxious, but I'll give it a shot. It's worth trying if it can help me manage those overwhelming moments better.

Therapist: Absolutely, Alicia. Like any new skill, it takes practice to make it a habit. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't catch the thoughts right away. Even small changes can make a big difference over time.

Another technique that can be helpful is deep breathing. When we're anxious or overwhelmed, our breathing often becomes shallow and rapid, which can actually increase feelings of stress. By focusing on taking slow, deep breaths, we can help activate our body's relaxation response.

Try this: When you notice yourself feeling anxious, take a few moments to breathe in deeply through your nose, counting to four. Hold the breath for a moment, then exhale slowly through your mouth, counting to six. Repeat this process several times, focusing on the sensation of the breath entering and leaving your body.

This technique can help calm your body and mind, making it easier to engage in other coping strategies like thought stopping. It's a simple but powerful tool you can use anywhere.

What are your thoughts on combining thought stopping with deep breathing? Do you think they could work together to help manage those overwhelming moments?

Patient: Combining thought stopping with deep breathing sounds like a good approach. I can see how focusing on my breath could help me calm down enough to actually use the "stop" command and shift my thoughts. 

I'll definitely try incorporating both techniques next time I feel overwhelmed. It might take some practice, but if it helps me manage those intense moments better, it's worth the effort.

Therapist: I'm glad you find the combination of thought stopping and deep breathing appealing, Alicia. Remember, it's all about finding what works for you. It might take some experimentation and practice to find the right mix of techniques, but that's the beauty of CBT – it's highly customizable to fit your unique needs and preferences.

As we discussed earlier, work-related stress and perfectionism have been significant challenges for you. I'm curious, how do you think these new techniques could apply to your work situation? Can you see yourself using thought stopping or deep breathing in moments of pressure or self-doubt?

Patient: Definitely. I can see myself using these techniques when I'm reviewing code or preparing for a big meeting. Those are the moments when I tend to get caught up in negative thoughts and start feeling overwhelmed. 

For example, if I find a small error in my code, I can use the "stop" command to interrupt the catastrophic thinking and then take a few deep breaths to calm down before addressing the issue. It might help me approach the problem more rationally and less emotionally.

I guess the key will be remembering to actually do it when I'm in the middle of those stressful moments. But I'm hopeful that with practice, it could make a real difference.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Alicia. Applying these techniques to your work situation can make a big impact on your overall stress and well-being. And you're right, the challenge is remembering to use them in the heat of the moment. That's why practicing regularly – even when you're not in a highly emotional state – is so important.

It might also be helpful to create some visual reminders for yourself. For instance, you could write the "stop" command on a small sticky note and put it somewhere you'll see it often, like on your computer monitor. Or you could create a coping card with your deep breathing instructions and keep it in your wallet or on your phone for easy access.

Having these visual cues can help trigger your brain to use these new techniques when you need them most. It's like building a habit ahead of time, so that it's easier to fall back on when you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed.

What do you think about creating some reminders like these for yourself? How can you envision incorporating them into your daily life?

Patient: Creating visual reminders sounds like a good idea. I could definitely use a sticky note with the "stop" command on my monitor at work. It would be a constant reminder to use the technique when I start feeling anxious about my code or my performance.

I could also make a coping card with the deep breathing instructions and keep it in my bag. That way, I can pull it out whenever I need to take a few moments to calm down, whether it's at work or somewhere else.

I think these visual cues could really help me remember to use these techniques when I'm in the middle of a stressful situation. It's like having a mental safety net to fall back on.

Therapist: Exactly, Alicia. Having those visual cues can be a powerful tool for building new habits and coping strategies. It's about making it as easy as possible for yourself to use these techniques, even in moments when you might not feel up to it.

Of course, it's normal to have some challenges along the way. There might be times when you don't remember to use the reminders, or you might struggle to use the techniques effectively. That's okay – it's all part of the learning process.

When you encounter those challenges, try to be kind and compassionate with yourself. You're trying to change long-standing patterns of thinking and behavior, which takes time and practice. There's no need to be critical or discouraged when things don't go perfectly.

Instead, acknowledge the effort you're making and the small steps you are taking towards change. Celebrate those victories, no matter how small they might seem. Every time you use a coping strategy or interrupt a negative thought, that's a step in the right direction.

What are your thoughts on being compassionate with yourself as you navigate this process? Do you have any self-critical thoughts that come up when you're struggling with these new techniques?

Patient: You're right, being compassionate with myself is important. I tend to be really hard on myself when I don't meet my own expectations, especially at work. If I forget to use the reminders or struggle with the techniques, I start thinking things like, "I should be better at this by now" or "I'm never going to get this right."

But I guess those thoughts just reinforce the negative cycle. If I can be more compassionate and remind myself that it's okay to struggle and that I'm making progress, even if it's slow, it might help me stick with these techniques in the long run.

I'll try to focus on the small victories and celebrate the times when I do remember to use the reminders or successfully interrupt a negative thought. It's a work in progress, but I'm committed to getting better at managing my stress and anxiety.

Therapist: That's a great perspective, Alicia. Being compassionate with yourself is essential to the healing process. Those self-critical thoughts can actually make things harder by adding more stress and pressure.

So when you notice those thoughts coming up, I encourage you to challenge them and replace them with more realistic or even kinder thoughts. Remind yourself that progress isn't always linear – there will be ups and downs – but every little step counts.

And you're absolutely right that celebrating the small victories can help keep you motivated and engaged in the process. Those little wins are like fuel for the journey ahead.

As you continue to practice these new techniques, remember to pay attention to how your thoughts and feelings are interconnected. When you use the "stop" command or engage in deep breathing, notice how it affects your emotions and physical sensations.

For example, you might notice that your anxiety levels decrease as you take control of your thoughts and breathe more deeply. Or you might feel a sense of accomplishment when you successfully complete a task using a new strategy.

By tuning into those connections, you can start to build a more positive feedback loop. The more you notice the benefits of these techniques, the more motivated you'll be to keep using them, even when it's challenging.

What do you think about that idea of tuning into the connections between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors? Do you feel like it could be a helpful tool in maintaining your progress?

Patient: I think tuning into those connections could be really helpful. It's easy to get caught up in the moment and not notice how my thoughts and feelings are affecting each other. But if I can start paying more attention to those connections, it might help me understand why I react the way I do and how I can better manage those reactions.

For example, if I notice that my anxiety levels decrease after using the "stop" command and deep breathing, that's a clear sign that these techniques are working. It would give me more motivation to keep using them, even when it's tough.

I'll try to be more mindful of those connections and see if it helps me stay committed to these new strategies. It's all about finding what works for me and making it a part of my daily routine.

Therapist: Absolutely, Alicia. Tuning into those connections can be a powerful tool for building awareness and motivation. It's a way of learning how your thoughts and feelings influence each other, and how your actions can shape both.

And you're right, noticing the positive impacts of the techniques can be a big motivator. When you see how these strategies lead to more favorable emotions and outcomes, it's easier to keep using them, even when it's challenging.

As you practice tuning into those connections, remember that it's a skill that develops with time. Like any new habit, it takes practice to get good at it. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small wins along the way.

And remember, you don't have to do it alone. I'm here to support you and help you make sense of what you're learning. Whether it's challenges with the techniques or insights you want to share, don't hesitate to bring it up in our sessions. That's what I'm here for.

What do you think about incorporating more mindfulness into your daily routine? Do you feel like it could be a helpful tool for you in managing your stress and anxiety?

Patient: Incorporating more mindfulness into my daily routine sounds like a good idea. I think it could help me stay more grounded and aware of my thoughts and feelings throughout the day.

For example, I could start my day with a few minutes of deep breathing or mindfulness meditation. That might help me set a positive tone for the rest of the day and make it easier to use the "stop" command when I start feeling anxious.

I could also try to be more mindful during my workday, taking short breaks to focus on my breath or just being present in the moment. It might help me avoid getting too caught up in negative thoughts and keep me more focused on the task at hand.

I'm willing to give it a try and see how it goes. It might take some time to get used to, but if it helps me manage my stress and anxiety better, it's worth the effort.

Therapist: That's a great approach, Alicia. Starting and ending your day with mindfulness practices can be a powerful way to set a positive tone and make the techniques more accessible throughout the day. And taking short breaks during your workday to be present and focus on your breath can help you stay grounded and avoid getting overwhelmed.

It's normal for it to feel a bit challenging at first, but like any new skill, it gets easier with practice. And remember, the key is to be gentle with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.

As you start incorporating more mindfulness into your routine, pay attention to how it affects your thoughts, feelings, and actions. Notice how those brief moments of presence can impact your overall well-being and ability to use the coping strategies we've been discussing.

Patient: I appreciate the encouragement, Nova. I'll definitely keep an eye on how mindfulness affects my thoughts and feelings. It's good to know that progress might not always be smooth, but as long as I stay committed, I should see some benefits.

I'm curious, though—do you have any specific mindfulness exercises you'd recommend for someone just starting out? I want to make sure I'm doing it right and getting the most out of it.
