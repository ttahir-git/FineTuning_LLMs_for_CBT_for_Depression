Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. 

With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of things. Work has been really intenseâ€”I had a big project deadline last week, and it took up most of my time. I did try to set some boundaries, like not checking emails after 8 PM, but it was hard to stick to that. 

On the personal side, I've been feeling pretty isolated. I canceled my salsa class again because I was too tired, and I haven't reached out to any friends. I did manage to do some breathing exercises before bed, which helped a bit with my sleep, but I still wake up feeling exhausted.

Therapist: It sounds like work has been demanding, and it's been challenging to prioritize self-care and social connection. I'm glad to hear that you've been trying to set boundaries at work, even if it's been difficult to maintain them consistently. The breathing exercises you've been practicing before bed are a great start, and it's good that they've had some positive impact on your sleep.

Given what you've shared, what would you like to focus on in our session today? We could explore ways to maintain boundaries at work, strategies for managing stress and exhaustion, or how to nudge yourself towards more social engagement. What feels most important or pressing to you right now?

Patient: I think I'd like to focus on managing stress and exhaustion. I know I need to set better boundaries at work, but I'm not sure how to do that without feeling guilty or like I'm letting my team down. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of overworking and then feeling burnt out. I want to break that cycle, but I don't know where to start.

Therapist: That's a great goal, and I appreciate your honesty about the challenges you're facing. It's common to feel guilty about setting boundaries, especially in a collaborative work environment. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me about a specific situation at work recently where you felt overwhelmed and struggled to set boundaries?

Patient: Sure. Last week, my team was working on a critical bug fix for a major client. I was already handling a lot of other tasks, but my manager asked me to take on the bug fix as well. I felt like I couldn't say no because I didn't want to look incapable or like I wasn't a team player. So, I took it on, but it meant working late every night and feeling even more stressed. By the end of the week, I was so exhausted that I made a few mistakes in my other work.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that example. It highlights the pressure you feel to take on everything that's asked of you, even when you're already overwhelmed. It's also clear that this pattern is taking a toll on your well-being and potentially impacting your work performance. Let's break this down a bit.

When you say yes to taking on additional work, what thoughts are going through your mind? What are the underlying beliefs or assumptions that drive your decision?

Patient: I guess I'm thinking that if I say no, my manager will think I'm not capable or that I'm not committed to the team. I also feel like I need to prove myself, especially since I'm one of the few women in a leadership position. It's like I have this fear that if I don't do everything perfectly, I'll be seen as less competent.

Therapist: Those are really important insights, Alicia. It sounds like there are some deeply held beliefs about your worth, competence, and place in the workplace. These beliefs can be powerful motivators, but they can also lead to burnout and poor self-care. Let's explore this further using the CBT model.

For this session, I'd like to propose the following agenda:
1. Identify the automatic thoughts and intermediate beliefs that contribute to feelings of guilt and inadequacy when setting boundaries at work.
2. Examine and challenge these beliefs using evidence-gathering and alternative perspectives.
3. Develop specific boundary-setting strategies that align with your values and priorities.
4. Discuss self-care strategies to support sustainable work practices.

How does this agenda feel for you? Is there anything you'd like to add or change?

Patient: That agenda sounds good to me. I think it's important to challenge those beliefs because they're definitely making things harder for me. I'm ready to dive into it and see if we can find some ways to make setting boundaries feel less daunting.

Therapist: Great, let's start by identifying some specific situations or triggers that lead to feelings of guilt and inadequacy when setting boundaries at work. We discussed the bug fix example earlier, but are there other scenarios that come to mind?

Patient: Another example would be when I have to delegate tasks to my team. I feel guilty if I think they might be overloaded or if I'm not sure they'll do the task as well as I would. I end up taking on more tasks myself to avoid that feeling, even if it means I'm overburdened.

Therapist: That's another great example. It highlights the concern you have for your team's well-being and the desire to be a supportive leader. However, it also points to some unrealistic expectations or assumptions you might be making about others' abilities.

Let's examine this belief using the evidence-gathering technique. Can you think of a time when you delegated a task and felt confident in your team's ability to handle it, and the outcome was positive?

Patient: Hmm, there was a time when I delegated a complex coding task to one of my team members. I was hesitant at first, but I knew they had the skills for it. They ended up completing the task ahead of schedule and did a great job. It actually freed me up to focus on other important projects.

Therapist: That's a great example of evidence that challenges your belief about delegation. It shows that when you trust your team's abilities, positive outcomes can follow. It also highlights the benefit of delegating in terms of your own workload and productivity.

Another technique we can use is cognitive restructuring. Let's look at the thought "If I delegate this task, my team will be overwhelmed and not do it well." What would be a more balanced or alternative thought?

Patient: Maybe a more balanced thought could be, "If I delegate this task, my team will have the opportunity to grow and show their skills. It might also help me manage my workload better and avoid burnout."

Therapist: Excellent reframe, Alicia! That alternative thought acknowledges the benefits of delegation for both you and your team. It also challenges the assumption that delegating will necessarily lead to overwhelm or poor performance.

As you practice reframing these types of thoughts, it can help reduce feelings of guilt and inadequacy when setting boundaries. Remember, setting boundaries is an act of self-care and can actually improve your overall productivity and well-being.

Let's discuss some specific strategies for setting boundaries at work. What do you think would be helpful to you in terms of communication and follow-through?

Patient: I think being clear and upfront about my availability and workload would help. For example, setting specific times for meetings and sticking to them, or letting my team know when I'm unavailable for additional tasks. It's also important to be consistent, so they know what to expect.

Therapist: Those are great strategies, Alicia. Being clear and upfront about your availability and workload can help set expectations and reduce the pressure to say yes to everything. Consistency is also key in maintaining boundaries, as it helps build trust and understanding with your team.

Another helpful strategy is to offer alternative solutions when appropriate. For example, if a team member asks you to take on a task, you could reply by acknowledging their request and expressing your willingness to help, while also sharing your current workload and asking if there might be another team member better equipped to handle the task.

Remember, setting boundaries is a process, and it's okay to start small. Begin with one or two strategies and practice them consistently before adding more. As you build confidence and comfort, you can gradually expand your boundary-setting repertoire.

How do you feel about incorporating some of these strategies into your work routine over the next week?

Patient: I feel like these strategies could really help. I'll start by being more upfront about my availability and workload, and try to offer alternative solutions when possible. It's a good place to start, and I'm hopeful it will make a difference.

Therapist: That's great, Alicia. Remember, setting boundaries is a process, and it's okay to take small steps. As you practice these strategies consistently, you'll likely find it easier to set boundaries in other situations as well.

Another helpful technique is to prepare for potential challenges or pushback. Let's explore a specific scenario where you might encounter resistance when setting boundaries. What might that scenario look like for you?

Patient: One scenario could be when my manager asks me to take on an additional project, even though I'm already stretched thin. I usually feel obligated to say yes, but I know it would add more stress to my plate.

Therapist: That's a great scenario to explore, Alicia. Let's imagine that situation happening next week. Using the boundary-setting strategies we've discussed, what might you say to your manager in that moment?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the support. In that scenario, I might say, "Thank you for considering me for this project, but I'm currently focused on my team's deliverables and another high-priority task. Is there someone else who might be better suited for it right now? I'm happy to help in any way I can once my current workload is more manageable."

I think being clear about my current priorities and offering a solution by suggesting another team member can help manage expectations and demonstrate my commitment to my team and our ongoing projects.

Therapist: That's an excellent response, Alicia. You were able to express your commitment while also setting a clear boundary around your current workload. Offering an alternative solution shows that you're considering the bigger picture and the needs of the team.

As you practice setting boundaries, you'll likely encounter different scenarios and challenges. Remember that it's okay to start small and build up gradually. The key is to practice consistently and be persistent, even when it feels challenging.

In addition to setting boundaries at work, it's also important to prioritize self-care. Earlier, you mentioned that you've been struggling to maintain your usual self-care practices, such as salsa classes. Can you tell me a bit more about the thoughts or beliefs that might be holding you back from engaging in those activities?

Patient: I think part of it is the guilt I feel for not being productive enough. When I'm not coding or working, I feel like I'm wasting time. It's hard to justify taking time for myself when there's always more work to be done.

Therapist: That guilt around productivity and self-care is a common challenge, Alicia. However, it's essential to recognize that self-care is not a waste of time. In reality, it's an investment in your overall well-being and can actually improve your productivity and effectiveness in the long run.

Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought that self-care is a waste of time. What are some of the benefits you've experienced when you prioritize self-care, even if it's just for a short time?

Patient: When I do manage to take time for myself, like going to a salsa class or reading a sci-fi novel, I usually feel more relaxed and energized afterward. It helps clear my mind, and I often come back to work with fresh ideas and a better mood.

Therapist: Those are great examples of the benefits of self-care, Alicia. Taking care of your mental well-being can lead to increased energy, better mood, and even more creative thinking. It's about finding a balance between work and rest, rather than seeing them as mutually exclusive.

One strategy that can be helpful is to schedule self-care activities into your weekly routine, just as you would with work tasks. By planning for self-care, you're prioritizing your well-being and sending yourself the message that it's just as important as other responsibilities.

What do you think about scheduling a self-care activity in the coming week? It could be salsa class, reading, or something entirely different. The key is to make it something that brings you joy, relaxation, or personal growth.

Patient: I think scheduling a self-care activity is a good idea. Maybe I could block out an hour on Thursday evening for salsa class. It's something I enjoy, and it would get me out of the house and moving. I've always felt better after dancing, even if I feel a bit guilty initially.

Therapist: Scheduling an hour of salsa class on Thursday evening is a great step towards prioritizing self-care, Alicia. It's wonderful that you've already recognized the benefits of this activity in the past. Remember, it's okay to feel guilty initially, but the evidence shows that engaging in self-care can actually improve your overall well-being and productivity.

As you continue to practice setting boundaries at work and prioritizing self-care, it's essential to be patient with yourself. Change takes time, and there will likely be challenges along the way. However, with consistent practice and self-compassion, you can develop a healthier balance between work and personal life.

In the next week, I'd like to assign some homework to help you continue practicing these skills. First, I'd like you to implement one or two boundary-setting strategies in your work environment, such as being clear about your availability and offering alternative solutions. Second, schedule a self-care activity, like salsa class, and notice how it impacts your mood and energy levels. Third, practice reframing unhelpful thoughts related to productivity and self-care, using the cognitive restructuring techniques we discussed.

How do you feel about taking on this homework? Do you have any questions or concerns about it?

Patient: I think the homework sounds manageable. I'm a bit worried about sticking to the schedule, especially with work being so demanding, but I'll do my best. I'll start with setting boundaries at work and scheduling the salsa class. As for reframing thoughts, I'm still a bit unsure about how to do that effectively. Could you give me an example to help me understand better?

Therapist: Sure, let's practice reframing an unhelpful thought together, Alicia. Imagine a situation where a colleague asks you to take on an additional task, even though you're already overwhelmed with your current workload. The automatic thought might be, "I can't say no. If I do, they'll think I'm not a team player."

To reframe this thought, let's look at the evidence for and against it. What evidence do you have that says your colleague will think poorly of you for setting a boundary?

Patient: Well, I don't have any direct evidence that they'll think poorly of me. In fact, I've seen other team members set boundaries, and it didn't seem to affect their reputation negatively. They were still seen as reliable and committed to the team.

Therapist: That's a great point, Alicia. The evidence actually contradicts the automatic thought. In your team, setting boundaries hasn't been associated with negative judgments. Another perspective could be, "Setting boundaries is a sign of self-respect and is essential for maintaining my well-being and productivity.".

Patient: I see what you mean. It's about respecting my own needs and not just trying to please everyone else. I'll try to keep that in mind when I set boundaries at work.

Therapist: Exactly, Alicia. Remember, setting boundaries is not a sign of weakness or selfishness. It's an act of self-care and can lead to positive outcomes for both you and your team.

As you practice reframing thoughts, it might be helpful to use a thought record. This is a simple tool that helps you identify and challenge negative or unhelpful thoughts. It usually includes columns for the date/time, situation, emotions, automatic thought, evidence for/against, alternative thought, and outcome. By writing out your thoughts and examining the evidence, you can start to develop more balanced and realistic perspectives.

You can find many free thought record templates online. I encourage you to try using one over the next week to practice reframing your thoughts related to boundary-setting and self-care. Remember, the goal isn't to get rid of negative thoughts completely, but to develop a more balanced and helpful way of thinking.

How do you feel about using a thought record for homework this week? Do you have any questions or concerns?

Patient: I think using a thought record is a good idea. It sounds like a structured way to challenge my negative thoughts. I'll look for a template online and give it a try. I'm a bit concerned about finding the time to fill it out, but I'll make it a priority.

Therapist: That's great, Alicia. I'm glad you're open to trying a thought record for homework. Remember, it doesn't have to be perfect. Start by noticing one or two negative thoughts each day, and work on reframing them in the moment or writing it down later. The goal is to practice examining the evidence and developing a more balanced perspective.

If you find yourself struggling to find time for the thought record, consider setting aside a specific time each day, such as before bed or during a break at work. It's okay to start small and gradually build up.

As you work on setting boundaries and self-care, remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself. Change takes time, and there will likely be challenges along the way. Celebrate the small victories and be kind to yourself when things don't go as planned.

I'm here to support you every step of the way, Alicia. If you have any questions or concerns during the week, don't hesitate to reach out. We can always adjust the homework or strategy if it's not working for you.
