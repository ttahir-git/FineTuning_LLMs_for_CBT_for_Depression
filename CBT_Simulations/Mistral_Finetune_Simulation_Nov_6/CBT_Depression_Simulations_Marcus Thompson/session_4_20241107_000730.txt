Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for session 4. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel that you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service immediately. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues, so I'll be relying on your written communication to understand your thoughts and feelings. With that said, let's start with a check-in. How have you been since our last session? How has your mood been, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate the transparency. Since our last session, my mood's been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days are better—like when I manage to get in a good run along Lake Michigan or when I see my students really engaging with the material. But other days, like when I'm up late worrying about my mom's Alzheimer's or stressing over the budget, it's tough. I've been trying to stick to the thought record and budget planning exercises you suggested, but it's not always easy. I did manage to finalize the budget plan, which helped a bit. But I still find myself stress eating more than I'd like, especially late at night. Any tips on how to curb that?

Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Marcus. It's common for moods to fluctuate, especially when facing significant stressors like caregiving and financial planning. I'm glad to hear that you've been trying to use the thought record and budgeting exercises, even if it's challenging at times. Let's explore your stress eating a bit more. Can you tell me about the thoughts and feelings that come up when you engage in stress eating? What do you think the eating provides for you in those moments?

Patient: Sure, when I start stress eating, it usually happens late at night when I'm alone and everything's quiet. I think about how much I'm failing at everything—not being the perfect teacher, not being the perfect dad, not being the perfect caregiver for my mom. The eating feels like a way to numb those feelings, to give myself a little comfort in the moment. It's like I'm trying to fill a void, but it never really works. Instead, I just feel more guilty afterward.

Therapist: Thank you for being so open about what's going on inside, Marcus. It seems like the stress eating is a way to cope with those difficult thoughts and feelings that come up when everything feels overwhelming. The thoughts about not being "perfect" at all of your roles are weighing heavily on you. I want to acknowledge that the pressure to be perfect can be a lot to carry, especially in the context of so many important responsibilities. Let's look at those thoughts more closely. When you say you're not being the perfect teacher or dad or caregiver, what do you think is the "perfect" version of those roles would look like?

Patient: That's a good question, Nova. I guess the "perfect" version would be someone who can handle everything effortlessly—never missing a beat with the students, always being there for my kids, and taking care of my mom without breaking a sweat. It's like I'm constantly comparing myself to this ideal that's impossible to reach. I know it's unrealistic, but it's hard to shake off those thoughts.

Therapist: You've touched on an important point, Marcus. These perfectionistic standards can be unrealistic and can cause a lot of distress. It's not uncommon for people to hold themselves to impossible standards, especially when facing multiple challenges. The reality is that everyone struggles at times, and it's okay to have limits and need support. Let's try to challenge some of those perfectionistic thoughts. When you say you're not handling everything effortlessly, what evidence do you have to support that thought?

Patient: Well, there's plenty of evidence that I'm not perfect. Like last week, I had to reschedule a parent-teacher conference because I was too exhausted to stay late. Or when I missed my mom's doctor appointment because I had to cover for a colleague at school. And then there's the stress eating—that's a pretty clear sign that I'm not handling things perfectly.

Therapist: I hear you, Marcus. The evidence you mentioned does suggest that you're facing some challenges and limitations. However, I wonder if we're looking at this from a bit of a skewed perspective. While it's true that you're not meeting every expectation perfectly, it doesn't mean you're failing entirely. Let's look at those examples you shared. Rescheduling a parent-teacher conference shows that you communicated and found a solution, even if it wasn't the ideal scenario. Missing your mom's appointment because you covered for a colleague suggests that you're prioritizing your students' needs and being a team player. And the stress eating—while it's not ideal—shows that you're self-aware enough to recognize when you need some comfort. These are all signs of adaptability and resilience, even if they don't meet some unrealistic standard of perfection. What do you think?

Patient: You're right, Nova. I guess I can see how those examples show that I'm not completely failing. But I still feel like I'm not doing enough. I'm available for my students, but I'm not available for my family. I'm available for my family, but I'm not available for myself. It's like I'm always juggling and never fully present in any one area.

Therapist: That's a valid concern, Marcus. Balancing multiple responsibilities can feel overwhelming, and it's normal to feel stretched thin at times. However, I wonder if the belief that you need to be fully present in every area is another form of perfectionism. It might be more realistic to accept that there will be times when you need to prioritize one area over another, and that's okay. Have you considered talking to your family members about how you can support them while also taking care of yourself?

Patient: That's a good idea, Nova. I haven't really talked to my kids or my mom about how I'm feeling. I guess I've been trying to handle everything on my own, thinking that's what they'd want. But maybe if I open up to them, they can help me figure out a better balance. I'll try to have those conversations this weekend.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan, Marcus. Opening up to your loved ones about your struggles could be a big step towards finding a more sustainable balance. Remember, asking for help isn't a sign of weakness—it's a sign of strength and self-awareness. I'm glad you're willing to give it a try. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about the budget plan you finalized. How did that go? What did you discover about your spending habits and how they relate to your thoughts and feelings?

Patient: The budget plan was eye-opening, Nova. I realized I've been spending a lot more on convenience foods and takeout, especially on the days when I'm too tired to cook. It's like I'm using food as a way to cope with the stress of everything else. I also noticed that I'm spending more on things I don't really need, like random gadgets and clothes, just to feel a little better in the moment. It's like I'm trying to buy happiness, but it never lasts.

Therapist: You've made some really important observations, Marcus. It's common for people to use spending as a way to cope with difficult emotions. The temporary relief can feel good in the moment, but as you've noticed, it doesn't last. This is where we can use some of the cognitive restructuring techniques we've been practicing. When you find yourself wanting to make impulsive purchases, what thoughts are going through your mind? What are you telling yourself in those moments?

Patient: In those moments, I usually tell myself that I deserve a break, that I've earned it after all the hard work I've put in. It's like I'm trying to reward myself for being so busy and stressed out. But deep down, I know it's not really helping. It's just a quick fix that doesn't address the real issues.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Marcus. This is a perfect opportunity to practice challenging those thoughts. When you say you "deserve a break," what does that mean, exactly? What would a "break" look like in this situation?

Patient: A real break, I guess, would be something that actually helps me relax and recharge, like taking a walk by the lake or playing basketball with my friends. But instead, I end up buying something that just distracts me for a little while. It's like I'm trying to fill a hole with something that doesn't fit.

Therapist: That's a great analogy, Marcus. Trying to fill a mental health hole with material things is unlikely to be effective in the long term. Let's try to come up with a list of activities that could actually help you feel better in the moment, but are more sustainable than shopping. What are some things you could do for yourself that don't involve spending money?

Patient: Well, I could definitely go for a run along the lake, like I used to. That always helps clear my head. I could also spend some time reading, maybe one of those historical biographies I enjoy. And I could call a friend or a colleague to talk things through, instead of just bottling everything up.

Therapist: Those are all great ideas, Marcus. Running, reading, and connecting with others can all be really effective ways to cope with stress in the moment, without relying on spending. The next time you find yourself thinking about buying something as a way to feel better, see if you can refer back to this list and choose one of those activities instead. It might feel hard at first, but with practice, it can get easier. How does that sound?

Patient: It sounds like a good plan, Nova. I'll definitely try to stick to those activities instead of spending. It's going to take some effort, but I think it'll be worth it in the long run.

Therapist: I think you're right, Marcus. It will take effort, but it's a great goal to work towards. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Every time you choose an activity that actually helps you, instead of a quick fix, you're taking a step in the right direction. And it's okay if it's not always easy. That's why we're practicing.

As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in with how you're feeling. What are your main takeaways from our conversation?

Patient: My main takeaway is that I need to be more mindful about how I'm coping with stress. Instead of turning to spending or stress eating, I need to focus on activities that actually help me relax and recharge, like running or reading. It's going to be a challenge, but I'm ready to give it a try.

Therapist: That's great, Marcus. Being mindful about your coping strategies is a big step in the right direction. Remember, you don't have to be perfect at it right away. It's about progress, not perfection. I'm glad you're willing to give it a try.

Before we end, let's talk about homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing the cognitive restructuring techniques we've discussed, using the thought record to challenge unhelpful thoughts. I also encourage you to stick to your budget plan, including the percentage-based allocations you worked on. And finally, try to engage in one of the self-care activities we discussed when you're feeling stressed, instead of turning to spending or stress eating. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a solid plan, Nova. I'll definitely keep working on those cognitive restructuring techniques and stick to my budget. And I'll make sure to try out one of those self-care activities when I'm feeling stressed. Thanks for the support.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. I'm happy to support you in any way I can. Remember, progress isn't always easy, but it's worth it. And you don't have to do it alone. I'm here to help, and there are other people in your life who care about you too.

Let's plan to meet again next week to check in on your progress. In the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Take care, Marcus.
