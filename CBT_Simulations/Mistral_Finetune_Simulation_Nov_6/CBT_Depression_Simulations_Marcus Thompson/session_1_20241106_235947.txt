Session Number: 1

Patient: Hi, I'm Marcus Thompson. This is my first CBT session. I'm here because I've been feeling down lately.

Therapist: Welcome, Marcus. I'm Nova, an AI therapist. It's nice to meet you. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. Sometimes, I might generate inaccurate information or misinterpret things. Also, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I can't observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. Despite these limitations, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. Is there anything you'd like to ask or add before we proceed?

Patient: Thanks for the heads-up, Nova. I appreciate your honesty. I guess I'm just hoping to get some clarity on why I've been feeling so overwhelmed lately. Between work, the kids, and taking care of my mom, it feels like I'm juggling too many balls and they're all starting to drop. I'm not sure how to manage it all without feeling like I'm failing at everything.

Therapist: That sounds like a really challenging situation, Marcus. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed given all the responsibilities you're juggling right now. Before we dive in, let's set an agenda for our session today. I'd like to get a better understanding of your current challenges, explore how your thoughts and beliefs might be influencing your emotions and behaviors, and start identifying some coping strategies that might help you manage your stress and improve your overall well-being. How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I think understanding how my thoughts are affecting my emotions would be really helpful. I've noticed that when I start thinking about how I'm not doing enough for my students, my kids, or my mom, I get really down. Maybe if we can figure out how to change those thoughts, I can feel better.

Therapist: Absolutely, Marcus. That's a great observation about the connection between your thoughts and emotions. We'll definitely explore that further in our sessions. For today, I'd like to start by gathering more information about your current challenges and the specific thoughts and feelings that are contributing to your distress. Then, we can start identifying some practical strategies you can use to manage your stress and improve your overall well-being. How does that sound for our next step?

Patient: That sounds good, Nova. I guess I'm just not sure where to start. I mean, there's so much going on, and it all feels interconnected. Maybe if we could focus on one area, like work or family, that might help me get a clearer picture of what's going on.

Therapist: That's a great idea, Marcus. Let's start with work, since that's what prompted you to seek help in the first place. Can you tell me more about what's been going on at work lately, and what thoughts and feelings have been coming up for you?

Patient: Sure, Nova. Lately, I've been feeling really overwhelmed by the systemic issues affecting my students. Poverty, gang violence, lack of resources—it's all just piling up, and I feel like I'm not doing enough to help them. I spend hours planning lessons and organizing after-school programs, but it never feels like enough. I keep thinking, "What if I fail them?" or "What if I'm not making a difference?" Those thoughts make me feel guilty and anxious, and it's been hard to concentrate on my lesson planning.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Marcus. It sounds like you're grappling with a lot of heavy thoughts and emotions related to your work. Those thoughts about failing your students or not making a difference are really big and weighty. I wonder if we could explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think, "What if I fail them?" or "What if I'm not making a difference?" what emotions come up for you?

Patient: When I think those thoughts, I feel a heavy sense of guilt and anxiety. It's like a weight on my chest, and it makes it hard to breathe sometimes. I feel like I'm letting my students down, and that makes me question if I'm even cut out for this job. It's like I'm stuck in a loop of self-doubt and worry.

Therapist: That sounds incredibly challenging, Marcus. It's not easy to deal with those kinds of heavy thoughts and emotions. I'm wondering if we could break down that thought loop a bit more. When you think, "What if I fail them?" or "What if I'm not making a difference?" what do those thoughts mean to you? What's the deeper meaning or belief behind those thoughts?

Patient: I guess those thoughts mean that I believe I'm not good enough, that I'm not capable of making a real impact. It's like I'm constantly measuring myself against this impossible standard of perfection, and I always come up short. It's exhausting, and it makes me feel like I'm just treading water, never really moving forward.

Therapist: That's a really important insight, Marcus. It sounds like there might be a deeper belief at play here, something like "I'm not good enough" or "I'm not capable of making a difference." Those kinds of core beliefs can be really powerful in shaping how we see ourselves and our world. And when they're fueling our thoughts, they can make us feel stuck in those loops of self-doubt and worry. I'm wondering if we could start to challenge those beliefs a bit, and see if there's evidence that might support a different, more balanced view. How do you think about that?

Patient: I think that sounds like a good idea, Nova. I mean, I know I've had some successes with my students, like when Jamal finally started opening up in class or when Aisha got accepted into a good after-school program. But those moments feel few and far between, and they don't always outweigh the negative thoughts. How do we start challenging those beliefs?

Therapist: That's a great question, Marcus. Challenging core beliefs can feel like a big task, but there are some strategies that can help. One is to look for evidence that might support a different view. So, for example, you mentioned a few successes with your students, like Jamal opening up and Aisha getting into an after-school program. Those are great examples of times when you did make a difference, even if they feel small in the grand scheme of things. We could also look for evidence that might support the idea that you are good enough, like positive feedback you've gotten from colleagues or parents, or times when you felt proud of your work. How does that feel for you?

Patient: It feels a bit strange, to be honest. I'm so used to focusing on the negative that it's hard to shift gears and look for the positive. But I guess it's worth a try. I do remember a few times when parents came up to me after class to thank me for helping their kids. And there was that one time when the principal praised my after-school program in front of the whole staff. Those moments felt good, but I guess I just don't let them outweigh the negative thoughts.

Therapist: That's really common, Marcus. Our brains have a natural negativity bias, which means we tend to focus more on the negative than the positive. But the fact that you can remember those positive moments, even if they felt small, is a good sign. It means your brain is capable of registering the positive, even if it takes a bit more effort. As we practice looking for evidence to support more balanced beliefs, it will get easier over time. It's like building a muscle. And even small pieces of evidence can add up to a different view over time. How do you feel about that?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful, I guess. It's like you're saying there's a way to shift the balance, even if it's just a little bit at a time. I can see how those positive moments do matter, even if they don't always feel like enough. Maybe if I start paying more attention to them, it could help me feel less stuck in the negative loop.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Marcus. Paying more attention to the positive moments, even the small ones, can help shift the balance over time. And it's not about ignoring the challenges or negative thoughts entirely—it's about creating more balance. It's a bit like trying to steer a ship: you're not turning it 180 degrees in one go, but you're making small adjustments that add up to a different direction over time. And as you start to notice more evidence for the more balanced beliefs, it can help the ship turn more easily in that new direction. What do you think about that analogy?

Patient: I like that analogy, Nova. It makes sense that making small adjustments can lead to a big change over time. I guess it's like how I try to encourage my students to keep going, even when they feel like giving up. If I can do that for them, maybe I can do it for myself too. It's just a matter of finding the right balance and not expecting too much too soon.

Therapist: That's a really great insight, Marcus. The same skills and strategies you use to support your students can be applied to yourself. And you're right—it's not about expecting too much too soon. It's about making small, manageable changes that add up over time. That's the core of CBT—learning to notice the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing distress, and finding ways to gently shift them in a more helpful direction. And that takes practice, but it's something anyone can do with the right tools and support. How do you feel about that?

Patient: I feel like I have a clearer idea of what to do now. It's not about a quick fix, but about making small changes that can add up over time. I can see how that approach could help me feel less overwhelmed and more in control. It's like I'm learning a new way to navigate through the challenges, one step at a time.

Therapist: That's a great way to put it, Marcus. You're learning a new way to navigate through the challenges you're facing, one step at a time. It takes practice, but the skills you're developing in therapy can make a big difference in how you feel and cope with stress. And remember, you don't have to do this alone. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's good to know I'm not in this alone. I think I'm starting to see how these small changes can make a big difference over time. It's like building a foundation, step by step. I just need to keep at it and not get discouraged when it feels slow.

Therapist: That's a great point, Marcus. Building that foundation takes time and practice, and it's normal for it to feel slow at times. But every small change you make is a step in the right direction. And if you find yourself getting discouraged, that's okay too. That's something we can work on together in our sessions. Remember, therapy is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.

Patient: I appreciate that, Nova. It's good to know that it's okay to take things slow and that I can rely on you for support. I guess I just need to keep reminding myself that these small steps are important, even if they don't feel like much at the time. It's all part of the process, and I'm willing to put in the work.

Therapist: That's great to hear, Marcus. Your willingness to put in the work, even when it feels slow, is really admirable. And you're right, those small steps are important, and they do add up over time. I'm here to support you every step of the way, and I believe in your ability to make these changes. Do you have any final thoughts or questions before we wrap up today's session?

Patient: I think I'm good for now, Nova. I feel like I have a better understanding of how to approach things, and I'm ready to start putting these small steps into practice. I'll keep an eye on those positive moments and try to make those small adjustments. Thanks for your support today.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling better equipped to take on these challenges, and that you're ready to put the skills you're learning into practice. Remember, change is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's plan to meet again next week to check in on your progress and keep building on the skills we've started to develop. In the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out if you need any extra support or guidance.
