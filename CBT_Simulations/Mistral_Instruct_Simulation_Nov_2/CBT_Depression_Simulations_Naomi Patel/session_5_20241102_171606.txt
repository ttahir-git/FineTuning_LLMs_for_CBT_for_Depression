Session Number: 5

Patient: Hi, I'm Naomi Patel. This is my 5 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

Let me help you complete those thoughts and provide a structured approach for having conversations with your parents about pronouns:

**Strategies for Having Conversations with Parents About Pronouns**:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Write down key points you want to communicate
   - Practice with a friend or in front of a mirror
   - Anticipate possible questions or concerns
   - Have resources ready to share

2. **Choosing the Right Time and Place**:
   - Select a quiet, private setting
   - Choose a time when everyone is calm and not rushed
   - Consider having the conversation during a peaceful activity, like after dinner
   - Have a backup plan if the conversation becomes too overwhelming

3. **Using "I" Statements**:
   - "I feel..." instead of "You always..."
   - "I would appreciate..." instead of "You need to..."
   - "I've been thinking about..." instead of "You don't understand..."

4. **Providing Information**:
   - Share educational resources
   - Be patient with questions
   - Acknowledge that this might be new information for them
   - Give them time to process

Would you like to practice some specific phrases or scenarios that you might use when having this conversation with your parents?

Therapist: Of course! It's always helpful to practice beforehand. Here are some examples of phrases you could use during your conversation:

1. "Mom and Dad, I've been doing some self-exploration, and I've discovered that I'm transgender. I would like you to use my correct pronouns, which are he/him."

2. "I understand that this might be confusing, but please remember that using my preferred pronouns is a matter of respect and acknowledging my identity."

3. "It's important to me that we can have an open and honest dialogue about this. I know we may have differing opinions, but I value our relationship and I hope we can find a way to navigate this together."

4. "If you have questions or need more information, I've compiled some resources that I believe will help us both understand this better."

Remember to stay calm and patient during the conversation. It's important to approach the discussion with understanding that your parents may need time to process this information. Encourage open communication and be willing to listen to their concerns and thoughts as well.

It's also crucial to emphasize that your identity is not a reflection of their failure as parents. Reassure them that you love them and that your relationship is important to you.

Best of luck with your conversation! I'm here to support you if you need anything.

Patient: Thanks for the examples, Nova. I think those phrases will really help me stay calm and clear during the conversation. I've been feeling a bit anxious about it, but practicing these statements makes it seem more manageable.

One thing I'm still struggling with is how to handle it if they react negatively or refuse to use my pronouns. I know it's important to stay patient, but I'm not sure how to respond if they get upset or dismissive. Do you have any advice for that kind of situation?

Therapist: In such a situation, it's essential to maintain a calm and assertive demeanor. Here are a few suggestions on how to respond if your parents react negatively or refuse to use your chosen pronouns:

1. **Reiterate your feelings**: Let them know that using your correct pronouns is important to you and helps you feel respected.

2. **Set boundaries**: Make it clear that you expect your chosen pronouns to be used when speaking to you. Explain that intentionally misgendering you is hurtful and disrespectful.

3. **Offer education**: Share resources that help them understand the significance of using correct pronouns and why it's important to you.

4. **Encourage empathy**: Ask them to put themselves in your shoes and imagine how it would feel if they were consistently misgendered.

5. **Maintain open communication**: Encourage them to express their concerns or questions, and listen to their perspective with empathy.

6. **Take care of yourself**: Remember that it's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your emotional well-being. If the conversation becomes too overwhelming, it may be best to take a break and revisit the conversation when emotions have calmed down.

7. **Seek support**: Reach out to friends, therapists, or support groups that can offer guidance, encouragement, and validation during challenging times.
