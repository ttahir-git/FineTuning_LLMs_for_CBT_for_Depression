Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again! Let's start this session by discussing how things have been going with the homework assignments we covered in the last session.

1. Writing down and challenging negative thoughts about breaks: How have you found this exercise? Have you noticed any improvements in your perspective about taking breaks?

2. Practicing mindfulness techniques: How consistent have you been with your mindfulness practice, and how have you felt after incorporating deep breathing into your daily routine?

3. Preparing scripts for parent conversations: Have you had an opportunity to talk to your parents about using their preferred pronouns, and if so, how did it go? If not, are you feeling more comfortable with the idea?

4. Incorporating self-care activities: How have the new self-care activities (cooking vegetarian meals and poetry writing) been helping you manage stress and improve your overall well-being?

We'll also explore some new strategies for addressing the challenges you've mentioned, like managing feelings of guilt and taking steps to have pronoun conversations with your parents. Let's work together to set realistic goals for our sessions moving forward and identify specific techniques to help you achieve them.

Remember, CBT is a process, and progress may not always be linear. It's important to be patient and give yourself the time you need to grow. Let's dive into the session and work towards the changes you'd like to see in your life.

Now that we've reviewed what we covered last time, what would you like to discuss today during our session?

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to see you too. Let me address each of those points:

1. **Challenging Negative Thoughts About Breaks**: I've been writing down my negative thoughts about taking breaks, like "I'm lazy if I take a break" or "I'll fall behind." Challenging these thoughts has been eye-opening. I've started to see that breaks can actually help me focus better in the long run, but I still feel guilty sometimes.

2. **Mindfulness Techniques**: I've been trying to practice deep breathing daily, especially when I feel overwhelmed. It helps a bit, but I forget to do it consistently. I think I need more reminders or a specific routine to make it stick.

3. **Scripts for Parent Conversations**: I haven't had the courage to talk to my parents about pronouns yet. I've been preparing scripts, but every time I think about bringing it up, I get really anxious. I'm not sure if I'm ready, but I do want to have that conversation eventually.

4. **Self-Care Activities**: Cooking vegetarian meals and writing poetry have been really helpful. Cooking gives me a sense of connection to my culture and mindfulness, and writing poetry helps me express my feelings. However, I still feel guilty when I take time for these activities instead of studying.

Today, I'd like to focus on how to manage this

Therapist: guilt associated with taking breaks and self-care activities. Let's break down our session today into two main parts:

1. Managing guilt associated with taking breaks:
   - Identifying the source of guilt
   - Exploring the underlying beliefs and assumptions
   - Cognitive restructuring to challenge and change negative thoughts
   - Developing a plan for self-compassion and self-care

2. Incorporating self-care activities into a daily routine:
   - Exploring various self-care activities
   - Identifying preferences and interests
   - Scheduling self-care activities in a way that minimizes feelings of guilt
   - Practicing mindfulness and gratitude to enhance the self-care experience

We'll also discuss strategies to help you feel more confident about having conversations with your parents regarding pronouns if that's something you'd like to explore in the future.

As we go through each part, we'll work together to identify specific techniques and exercises that will help you achieve your goals and move forward in your personal growth journey. Let's start with managing guilt associated with taking breaks. Are you ready to dive in?

Patient: Yes, I'm ready to dive in. Let's start with managing guilt associated with taking breaks.

**Identifying the Source of Guilt**: I think the guilt comes from a belief that I should be constantly productive, especially since I'm a graduate student and there's always so much to do. I feel like taking breaks is a sign of weakness or laziness.

**Exploring Underlying Beliefs and Assumptions**: I assume that if I take breaks, I'll fall behind in my studies and disappoint my parents, who have high expectations for me. This assumption makes me feel guilty whenever I take time for myself.

**Cognitive Restructuring to Challenge and Change Negative Thoughts**: I've been writing down these negative thoughts, but I'm not sure how to challenge them effectively. Can you give me an example of how to do this?

**Developing a Plan for Self-Compassion and Self-Care**: I want to learn how to be kinder to myself and make self-care a regular part of my routine without feeling guilty. How can I start doing that?

Therapist: **Cognitive Restructuring to Challenge and Change Negative Thoughts**:

* Negative Thought: "I should be constantly productive."
  * Reframed Thought: "It's important to find a balance between productivity and self-care for a sustainable and healthy lifestyle."
* Negative Thought: "Taking breaks is a sign of weakness or laziness."
  * Reframed Thought: "Taking breaks can help improve focus and productivity in the long run."
* Negative Thought: "I'll fall behind in my studies if I take breaks."
  * Reframed Thought: "Short, regular breaks can actually help maintain productivity and prevent burnout, leading to better performance in the long run."

**Developing a Plan for Self-Compassion and Self-Care**:

1. Self-Talk: Replace critical self-talk with compassionate self-talk. Instead of saying things like "You're lazy for taking a break," say something like "It's okay to take a break. You deserve some rest."
2. Self-Affirmations: Write daily affirmations that reinforce positive beliefs about self-care and self-worth. For example, "I am capable and deserving of taking care of myself. Taking breaks is an essential part of maintaining my health and productivity."
3. Scheduled Self-Care: Schedule self-care activities into your daily or weekly routine to make them a regular part of your life. Make sure to choose activities that you enjoy and find relaxing.
4. Mindfulness and Gratitude: Practice mindfulness and gratitude during self-care activities to enhance the experience. Focus on your breath, the sensations in your body, and the positive feelings associated with self-care. Reflect on what you're grateful for in your life, and how self-care contributes to your overall well-being.

**Incorporating Self-Care Activities into a Daily Routine**:

1. Exploring Various Self-Care Activities:
   - Physical self-care (exercise, massages, stretching)
   - Emotional self-care (talking to a friend, journaling, listening to music)
   - Mental self-care (reading, puzzles, meditating)
   - Social self-care (spending time with loved ones, joining clubs or groups)
   - Spiritual self-care (praying, meditation, mindfulness)
2. Identifying Preferences and Interests:
   - Reflect on the self-care activities you enjoy and find relaxing.
   - Consider activities that align with your personal values and beliefs.
3. Scheduling Self-Care Activities:
   - Incorporate self-care activities into.

Patient: It sounds like a good plan. Let me try to apply these techniques to my situation:

**Cognitive Restructuring**:

* Negative Thought: "I should be constantly productive."
  * Reframed Thought: "Finding a balance between productivity and self-care is crucial for a healthy lifestyle."
* Negative Thought: "Taking breaks is a sign of weakness or laziness."
  * Reframed Thought: "Taking breaks can actually improve my focus and productivity over time."
* Negative Thought: "I'll fall behind in my studies if I take breaks."
  * Reframed Thought: "Short, regular breaks can help prevent burnout and lead to better performance in the long run."

**Developing a Plan for Self-Compassion and Self-Care**:

1. **Self-Talk**: I'll practice saying things like, "It's okay to take a break. I deserve some rest."
2. **Self-Affirmations**: I'll write daily affirmations such as, "I am capable and deserving of taking care of myself. Taking breaks is essential for my health and productivity."
3. **Scheduled Self-Care**: I'll schedule self-care activities like cooking vegetarian meals and writing poetry into my daily routine.
4. **Mindfulness and Gratitude**: During self-care activities, I'll focus on my breath and the positive feelings associated with

Therapist: self-care. I'll also reflect on what I'm grateful for in my life and how self-care contributes to my overall well-being.

**Incorporating Self-Care Activities into a Daily Routine**:

1. **Exploring Various Self-Care Activities**: I'll consider yoga, gardening, or taking a short walk as additional self-care activities to explore.
2. **Identifying Preferences and Interests**: I'll focus on activities that bring me joy and help me relax.
3. **Scheduling Self-Care Activities**: I'll schedule self-care activities into my calendar so that they become a regular part of my routine.
