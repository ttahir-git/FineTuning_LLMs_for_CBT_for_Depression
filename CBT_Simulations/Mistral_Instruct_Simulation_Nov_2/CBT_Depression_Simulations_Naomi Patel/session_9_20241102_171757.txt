Therapist: Understood, Naomi. Let me assist you in summarizing your last session. Since I don't have the conversation history, I will create a hypothetical summary as an example:

Session Summary:
1. Main Topics Discussed: Anxiety and stress related to work deadlines and interpersonal issues at work, as well as feelings of low self-esteem and perfectionism.
2. Techniques Introduced: Cognitive restructuring, where we identified and challenged irrational thoughts related to self-worth, and mindfulness meditation, to help manage stress and anxiety in the moment.
3. Helpful Elements: You found the cognitive restructuring exercise particularly helpful in identifying and reframing negative thoughts. We also discussed the importance of setting realistic expectations for yourself and others.
4. Homework Assigned: I suggested that you practice daily mindfulness meditation for 10 minutes, and keep track of the thoughts and emotions that come up during and after the practice. In addition, I asked you to challenge any negative self-talk that arises during the day using the cognitive restructuring techniques we discussed.
5. Key Insights or Realizations: You realized that your perfectionism and tendency to overcommit at work were contributing to your feelings of anxiety and stress, and that it might be beneficial to re-prioritize tasks and delegate when necessary. We also discussed the importance of self-compassion and self-care in managing your overall well-being.
