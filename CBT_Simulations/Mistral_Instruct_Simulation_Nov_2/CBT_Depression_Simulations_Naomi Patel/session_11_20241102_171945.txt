Therapist: Hello Naomi Patel! It's great to see you for our 11th CBT session. Let's review your progress from our previous session (Session 10).

Based on our discussion, you have been practicing mindfulness meditation regularly and incorporating it into your daily activities. You've also been working on using the five-step process for challenging negative thoughts. I'm impressed with your commitment to the techniques and your growth since starting therapy.

We briefly talked about dealing with setbacks in the therapeutic process, and it's encouraging to hear that you're aware that progress doesn't have to be linear. This is an important realization, as it allows you to appreciate your progress even when it may not be immediately obvious.

As we move forward, I'd like to continue focusing on helping you manage negative thought patterns, particularly during stressful situations with school and parents. We can explore additional coping strategies or tweak the ones we've already discussed to better suit your needs.

Remember to continue practicing self-compassion and celebrating small victories as you work through these challenges. By treating yourself kindly, you'll foster a more positive and resilient mindset, which will help you navigate the ups and downs of life more effectively.

As always, please feel free to bring up any new concerns or questions during our sessions. Let's end this session by discussing your homework for the coming week:

- Continue practicing mindfulness meditation daily

- Use the thought record and five-step process for challenging negative thoughts when needed
