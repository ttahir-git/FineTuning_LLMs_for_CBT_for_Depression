Session Number: 1

Patient: Hi, I'm Naomi Patel. This is my first CBT session. I'm here because I've been feeling down lately.

Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's nice to meet you. I'm here to help you using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is a practical, problem-solving approach that helps you understand and change thought patterns that lead to harmful feelings and behaviors.

During our sessions, we'll work together to identify your negative thoughts and beliefs, understand their impact on your feelings and behaviors, and develop coping strategies to change them.

Let's start with some basic information. Could you tell me a bit more about what's been making you feel down lately? This will help us focus on specific issues and goals for our work together.

Patient: Sure, I've been feeling really overwhelmed with my graduate studies. The workload is intense, and I'm struggling to keep up with all the deadlines. Plus, being in a new city and trying to navigate my identity as non-binary has been really challenging. My family back home doesn't fully understand, which adds to the stress. I've also had a few instances of self-harm when things get too much.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your concerns, Naomi. It sounds like you are dealing with quite a few challenging issues. Let's focus on your graduate studies for now.

First, it's important to acknowledge the effort you've put into managing such a heavy workload and the stress that comes with it. It's common to feel overwhelmed in the face of multiple deadlines and a demanding coursework, especially during graduate studies.

Now let's work on developing some coping strategies to help you manage these stressors better.

1. Breaking down your tasks: Rather than looking at the entire workload at once, break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. This can help you feel more in control and less overwhelmed.

2. Setting priorities: Not all tasks are equally important. Identify which tasks need to be done immediately, and which can be done at a later time.

3. Time management: Use a planner or calendar to help you organize your time more effectively.

4. Seek support: Reach out to your professors or teaching assistants if you're struggling with a particular subject. They are there to help you succeed.

5. Self-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes, and that everyone faces challenges in their academic journey.

6. Self-care: Make sure to prioritize self-care. This could be taking breaks to do something you enjoy, practicing relaxation techniques, or getting regular exercise.

Now, let's move on to discussing your identity as non-binary. We can work on developing strategies to help you navigate these challenges and feel more supported in your new environment. Would that be alright with you?

Patient: Yes, that sounds good. I've been trying to break down my tasks, but sometimes it feels like no matter how small I make them, there's always more to do. I do use a planner, but I often feel guilty when I take breaks. I've reached out to a few professors, but I still feel like I'm falling behind.

As for my identity, it's been really tough. My family's conservative background makes it hard for them to understand, and I feel isolated at times. I've found some support in the LGBTQ+ community here, but it's still a daily struggle.

Therapist: I understand that managing your academic workload and navigating your identity can be challenging, but remember that it's essential to take care of yourself during this process.

Regarding your task management, it's essential to balance work and self-care. When you schedule breaks, try to see them as necessary parts of your work routine rather than something to feel guilty about. This will help you recharge and come back to your tasks with renewed energy and focus.

In terms of your identity, I'm glad to hear that you've found support in the LGBTQ+ community in your new city. It's crucial to surround yourself with people who understand and support you.

Let's also work on identifying and challenging any negative thoughts or beliefs that may be exacerbating your feelings of stress and isolation. We'll use cognitive restructuring techniques to help you develop more positive, balanced thoughts.

For instance, you might be experiencing thoughts like, "If I don't do well in this course, I'm a failure," or "No one will understand or support me as non-binary." Together, we can work on rephrasing these thoughts to be more realistic and compassionate, such as, "I'm doing my best, and there will always be room for improvement," or "I may encounter challenges, but there are people who understand and support me."

By working on these strategies, I hope you'll feel more empowered to manage your stress, maintain your self-care, and find support in both your academic and personal life.

Session Summary:

Thank you for being so open about these challenges. Let's explore your feelings about taking breaks and the guilt that comes with it.

When you say you feel guilty taking breaks, can you tell me what thoughts go through your mind during those moments? For example, do you have specific thoughts like "I should be working" or "I don't deserve this break"?

Also, I hear that you've found some support in the LGBTQ+ community, which is great. Could you tell me more about what has been most challenging in terms of your daily struggles with identity? This will help us develop specific strategies to address both your academic stress and identity-related challenges.
