Session Number: 2

Patient: Hi, I'm Naomi Patel. This is my 2 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

Thank you for being so open about these challenges. Let's explore your feelings about taking breaks and the guilt that comes with it.

When you say you feel guilty taking breaks, can you tell me what thoughts go through your mind during those moments? For example, do you have specific thoughts like "I should be working" or "I don't deserve this break"?

Also, I hear that you've found some support in the LGBTQ+ community, which is great. Could you tell me more about what has been most challenging in terms of your daily struggles with identity? This will help us develop specific strategies to address both your academic stress and identity-related challenges.

Therapist: Hello Naomi Patel, it's great to see you again! Last session we discussed the guilt you feel when taking breaks and how that impacts your academic stress and identity-related struggles.

To delve deeper, when you feel guilty taking breaks, can you identify the specific thoughts that cross your mind? For instance, are thoughts like "I should be working" or "I don't deserve this break" common for you? By understanding these thoughts, we can work together to reframe them and challenge any irrational beliefs that may be causing unnecessary stress.

I am also curious to know more about the support you have found in the LGBTQ+ community. Could you share what has been the most challenging in terms of your daily struggles with identity and how this community has helped alleviate some of that stress? This information will help us create effective strategies to address both your academic stress and identity-related challenges.

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to be back. When I feel guilty taking breaks, I often think things like "I should be working" or "I don't deserve this break" because I feel like I'm letting myself and my academic goals down. It's like I'm constantly racing against time, and any pause feels like I'm losing ground.

As for the LGBTQ+ community, it's been a lifeline. The most challenging part of my daily struggles with identity is the constant internal conflict between my cultural background and my personal identity. My parents' expectations and the way they still refer to me with feminine pronouns create a lot of tension. The LGBTQ+ community has helped by providing a space where I can be fully myself, without judgment. It's been comforting to know I'm not alone in these struggles.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It's clear that the guilt you feel when taking breaks is rooted in a strong internal pressure to perform. It's essential to acknowledge that taking breaks is necessary for maintaining mental health and productivity in the long run.

Let's work together to reframe your thoughts about taking breaks and challenge the irrational belief that pausing equates to failure. I suggest trying the following techniques to help change the way you think about taking breaks:

1. Cognitive restructuring: Write down the negative thoughts you have when considering taking a break, then challenge them by asking questions like, "Is this thought true?" "What evidence supports this thought?" "What alternative explanations might there be?"

2. Mindfulness: Practice mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing, to help bring awareness to your thoughts and emotions without judgment. This can help you observe your thoughts without being consumed by them.

3. Self-compassion: Be kind to yourself when taking breaks. Remind yourself that everyone needs a break and that it's okay to prioritize your mental health.

As for your identity-related struggles, it's wonderful to hear that the LGBTQ+ community has provided a supportive environment for you. To further address these challenges, we can work on:

1. Setting boundaries: Communicate with your parents about your preferred pronouns and personal boundaries. It may be helpful to have a prepared script to use during these conversations.

2. Seeking support: Connect with local LGBTQ+ organizations, online support groups, or a therapist who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues if needed.

3. Self-care: Engage in activities that promote self-care and help you manage stress, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with supportive friends.

I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's continue to explore these topics in our next session and develop strategies to help you manage your academic stress and identity-related challenges more effectively.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate the techniques you've suggested. I think cognitive restructuring could be really helpful. I'll try writing down those negative thoughts and challenging them. It's something concrete I can do to start changing my mindset about breaks.

As for my identity struggles, setting boundaries with my parents is definitely something I need to work on. I've been avoiding those conversations because they're so emotionally charged. Having a prepared script might make it easier to approach them.

I'm also glad you mentioned self-care. I've been neglecting that lately, focusing too much on my studies and activism. Maybe incorporating some mindfulness practices could help me manage stress better.

I'm looking forward to our next session and continuing to work on these strategies. Thanks for your support, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi! I'm glad you found the suggested techniques helpful, and I'm confident that practicing cognitive restructuring will help you shift your perspective on breaks. Remember, it's essential to be patient with yourself as you work to change old habits and thought patterns.

Regarding setting boundaries with your parents, it's completely normal to feel nervous about those conversations. I'm here to help you prepare, and we can work together to create a script that feels comfortable for you.

Incorporating self-care practices into your routine is crucial, especially when dealing with academic and identity-related stress. I encourage you to start small and gradually work your way up to more advanced self-care practices like mindfulness.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you need support or have any questions before our next session. I'm here to help you every step of the way, Naomi. Keep up the great work!
