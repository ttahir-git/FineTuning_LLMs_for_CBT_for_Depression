Homework from last session:

3. Continue seeking outside support when needed

From our discussion, it seems that you've realized the importance of change taking time, the importance of proper timing and environment for difficult conversations, and that multiple approaches may be needed for family communication.

For today's session, let's focus on how the modified Self-Compassion Break is going and discuss any progress or challenges you've faced with family communication. We can also explore any other concerns or issues you'd like to address during our time together. How does that sound?

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to be back. I've been trying the simplified Self-Compassion Break, and it's been a bit easier to start with just one step. I've been focusing on saying "May I be kind to myself in this moment" when I feel overwhelmed. It's helping me pause and take a breath before reacting to stress.

As for the family communication strategies, I tried using "I" statements during our last conversation. It felt a bit awkward at first, but my mom seemed to listen more attentively. She didn't change her behavior right away, but I think she understood where I was coming from a little better. I'm trying to be patient and not expect immediate changes.

I do have a concern about my academic performance lately. The stress from balancing my studies, family, and identity is really taking a toll. I've been struggling to concentrate and meet deadlines. I'm worried that this might affect my grades and my ability to finish my thesis on time.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making progress with both the Self-Compassion Break and family communication strategies, which is fantastic, Naomi! Remember, it's essential to be kind and patient with yourself as you continue working on these skills.

Regarding your academic concerns, it's crucial to address them immediately. Let's develop a plan to help you manage your academic workload more effectively and reduce the stress you're feeling.

1. Prioritize Tasks: Make a list of tasks that need to be completed, and rank them based on their urgency and importance. Focus on completing the most important tasks first.

2. Time Management: Use a planner or scheduling app to organize your time effectively. Allocate specific times for studying, self-care, family communication, and other activities.

3. Seek Academic Support: Reach out to your professors, tutors, or academic advisors for help if you're struggling with certain coursework. They can offer guidance and resources to help you succeed.

4. Practice Self-Compassion: Continue using the Self-Compassion Break when you feel overwhelmed. Be kind to yourself and remind yourself that it's okay to ask for help.

5. Take Care of Yourself: Remember to prioritize self-care, such as getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities you enjoy. This will help you stay energized and focused on your academic work.

Let's discuss each of these strategies in more detail during our session today. I'm here to support you and help you develop a plan to manage your academic stress effectively.
