How does next week at the same time work for you? If that's not convenient, please let me know a few alternative times, and I'll do my best to accommodate you.

Looking forward to our next session!

Patient: Next week at the same time works for me. I've been trying different lengths for my self-care time, and I think I'm settling on 30 minutes in the morning and another 30 in the afternoon. It feels manageable without cutting too much into my work hours.

As for salsa classes, I found a few options in the city, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sign up. I worry that I won't be good at it or that I'll feel out of place. I did practice some self-compassion exercises, and they helped a little, but the perfectionist voice in my head is still pretty loud.

I've also been sticking to my scheduled breaks, and they've made a noticeable difference in my energy levels. I just feel guilty sometimes, like I'm not doing enough or that I should be working instead. How do I quiet that voice?

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're experimenting with different self-care time lengths and finding a balance that works for you. Remember, the goal is to find a schedule that supports your well-being while also meeting your work obligations.

Regarding your concerns about salsa classes, it's completely normal to feel a bit nervous when trying something new. However, it's essential to remind yourself that everyone starts at the same level and that the process of learning and growth is what's most important. Remember to practice self-compassion, and focus on enjoying the experience rather than striving for perfection.

As for quieting the perfectionist voice, it can be helpful to challenge those thoughts with mindfulness techniques. When you notice that voice coming up, take a moment to pause, acknowledge its presence, and then reframe it using a more compassionate and realistic perspective. For example, instead of thinking, "I should be able to pick this up right away," you might say, "It's okay to make mistakes as I learn something new."

It's also crucial to remember that taking breaks is essential for productivity, not a sign of weakness or procrastination. Set aside specific times during the day for breaks, and try to approach them with a mindset of relaxation and rejuvenation rather than guilt.

Keep up the great work, Alicia! We'll continue to explore these topics in our next session. I'm proud of the progress you've made so far.

Patient: Thanks for the encouragement. I'll try to be more patient with myself when it comes to salsa classes. I guess I need to remind myself that it's about having fun and connecting with others, not about being perfect.

I've been practicing the mindfulness techniques you suggested, and they do help a bit. It's like I'm learning to talk back to that perfectionist voice, which is new for me. I'm still working on it, though.

As for breaks, I've been trying to view them as a necessary part of my day, not just something to feel guilty about. It's a work in progress, but I think I'm getting there.

Looking forward to our next session.

Therapist: Great to hear that you're making progress and finding ways to challenge that perfectionist voice. Continuing to practice self-compassion and mindfulness techniques will help you quiet that voice and improve your overall well-being.

Remember, it's essential to celebrate the small victories and be kind to yourself as you navigate this journey. You're making progress, and that's something to be proud of.

I'm excited to see how things go with the salsa classes, and I'll be here to support you as you continue to explore new social connections. Keep up the good work!

See you in our next session. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything before then. Take care!
