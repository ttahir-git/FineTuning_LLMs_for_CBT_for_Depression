Session Number: 1

Patient: Hi, I'm Alicia Rodriguez. This is my first CBT session. I'm here because I've been feeling down lately.

Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's nice to meet you. I'm here to help you using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is a practical, action-oriented therapy that aims to help you understand and manage your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

Over the course of our sessions, we will work together to identify and challenge negative thought patterns, and learn coping skills to improve your mood. We'll also explore how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are related and how to make positive changes in your life.

To get started, can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing and how it's been affecting you?

Patient: Sure. Lately, I've been feeling really overwhelmed. I was promoted at work, which should be a good thing, but it's just added more pressure. I feel like I have to prove myself constantly, especially since I'm one of the few women in a leadership role. The job promotion has made me work even longer hours, and I'm finding it hard to concentrate. I've also been feeling really lonely since my grandmother passed away. She was my main support system, and now I feel like I'm drifting. I've been canceling social plans and just staying home, which isn't helping.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that with me, Alicia. It sounds like you've been under a lot of pressure recently, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. It's also unfortunate to hear about the loss of your grandmother and the impact it's had on you. It's normal to feel lonely after such a significant loss, and it's important to take care of yourself during this time.

One of the main goals of CBT is to help you identify and change negative thought patterns that contribute to your feelings of overwhelm. In the case of your work promotion, it's understandable that you might be feeling the need to prove yourself, but it's important to remember that you were selected for this position because you have the skills and qualifications to succeed. It's also important to set boundaries and take breaks when you need them.

Regarding your feelings of loneliness, it might be helpful to reach out to friends or family members for support. If you feel like you don't have anyone to talk to, there are also support groups available that can help you connect with others who are going through similar experiences.

Overall, it's important to practice self-compassion and try to focus on taking care of yourself during this challenging time. I'm here to support you and help you develop coping strategies to manage your feelings and improve your well-being.

Let's work together to identify any specific thoughts or situations that are contributing to your feelings of overwhelm and loneliness, and come up with strategies to challenge and change those negative thought patterns. Does that sound like a plan?
