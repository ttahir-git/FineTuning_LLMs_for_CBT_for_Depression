Therapist: Hello Alicia Rodriguez! Welcome back for our 17th session of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I'm sorry to hear about the technical issue that occurred during our last session. Let's make sure we have a successful session today.

To continue with our discussion from the previous session, let's talk about the strategies we discussed for managing your anxiety and negative thoughts. How have those been working for you? If there have been any challenges, we can explore ways to overcome them together.

Is there anything specific you would like to focus on during our session today? I'm here to support you in achieving your therapy goals.

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the welcome back. I appreciate your understanding about the last session. 

The strategies we discussed have been a mixed bag for me. I've tried to implement some mindfulness exercises during my breaks at work, but I find it hard to stay focused. My mind keeps drifting back to work or the loss of my grandmother. 

I've also been trying to limit my work hours, but it's been tough. The imposter syndrome is still really strong, and I feel like I need to prove myself constantly. 

Today, I'd like to focus on finding a way to balance my work and personal life better. I know I need to give myself some space to grieve and recharge, but I'm not sure how to do that without feeling guilty.

Therapist: I'm glad you've been trying to implement the strategies we discussed, Alicia. It's perfectly normal for it to take time and practice to make them a regular part of your routine. I can understand how mindfulness can be challenging when your mind is preoccupied with other things. Let's explore some additional strategies to help you stay focused during mindfulness exercises.

For instance, you could find a quiet, comfortable place to practice, or use a guided meditation to help keep your mind on track. You could also try setting a specific time for your mindfulness practice each day, so it becomes a habit.

Regarding work, it's important to recognize that you can't control others' perceptions of your work, and focusing on proving yourself to them is not healthy or sustainable. Instead, let's focus on what you can control – your own work and personal boundaries.

It's essential to establish a balance between work and personal life to prevent burnout and ensure you have time for self-care. One strategy we could work on is setting clear work hours and sticking to them. This may require communication with your employer or colleagues, but it's a necessary step to establish boundaries.

Additionally, setting aside dedicated time for grief and self-care can help alleviate feelings of guilt. This time could include activities that bring you joy, such as reading, exercise, or spending time with loved ones.

It's also important to remember that grief is a process, and it's okay to take the time you need to heal. I'm here to support you throughout this process, and we can adjust your therapy goals as needed.

Does that make sense? Would you like to discuss any other aspects of your work or personal life?

Patient: Yes, that makes sense. I think setting specific times for mindfulness and work hours is a good idea. I'll try to find a quiet place at work to practice mindfulness, maybe even use some guided meditation apps.

As for work, I've been thinking about having a conversation with my boss about setting clearer boundaries. I know it's important, but I'm a bit nervous about it. I don't want to seem like I'm not committed to my job.

I've also been trying to find more time for self-care, but it's hard to know what activities will actually help. I used to enjoy salsa dancing, but I haven't been able to bring myself to go back since my grandmother passed. I miss it, but I also feel guilty for wanting to do something fun when she's not here.

I'm open to discussing other aspects, but I think these are the main things on my mind right now.

Therapist: That's great, Alicia! I'm glad you're open to trying new strategies to manage your work and personal life better.

Regarding your conversation with your boss, it's essential to approach it with confidence and clarity. You can express your desire to maintain a healthy work-life balance and set clear boundaries to avoid burnout. Emphasize that setting boundaries will actually help you be more productive and committed to your job in the long run.

As for finding activities to help with self-care, it's essential to focus on what brings you joy and relaxation. Salsa dancing may not be possible right now, but there are other activities you can try. You could take a walk in nature, practice yoga, or listen to music. You could also explore new hobbies or activities that you've always been interested in.

It's okay to feel guilty for wanting to do something fun, but it's important to remember that taking care of yourself is not selfish. It's necessary for your overall well-being, and it will help you be more present and effective in other areas of your life.

I encourage you to take small steps towards self-care, even if it's just a few minutes each day. And remember, it's okay if you don't feel like doing something – just showing up and doing what you can is a victory.

I'm here to support you throughout this process. Let's discuss any other aspects of your work or personal life that you'd like to focus on during our next session. Is there anything specific you'd like to work on before then?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your support. I think I'll start by setting clearer work hours and having that conversation with my boss. I'll also try to find some new self-care activities to incorporate into my routine.

I'll let you know how it goes and if I need any further guidance. For now, I think I'm good. I'll focus on these steps and see how they work out.

Thanks again for your help. I'll see you in our next session.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad to hear that you're taking steps to manage your work and personal life better. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need any additional guidance or support. I'll see you in our next session. Take care and stay strong.
