Therapist: Hello Alicia Rodriguez, welcome to our fourth Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) session. It's great to see that you have been actively working on the techniques we discussed in our last session.

Let me recap the key points from our previous meeting:
- You have been implementing breathing exercises, bedtime routines, and scheduling self-care breaks.
- You have been focusing on work-life balance, setting boundaries, and managing social anxiety, especially regarding the salsa class.
- Sleep difficulties and stress management have been areas of concern as well.
- We discussed challenges in self-care and guilt surrounding taking breaks.

From your summary, it seems that the deep breathing exercises and recognizing the need for patience have been helpful for you. You have also realized that small, consistent steps can lead to meaningful change. This is a fantastic insight and a great indicator that the CBT techniques are working for you.

As part of your homework, I encourage you to continue with the practices that are helping you. If you find that the self-care reminders are helping, keep them up. If you need to adjust the frequency or time, don't hesitate to make those changes.

Remember, setting boundaries in the workplace is essential for your well-being. Take some time to draft that email about managing your workload. It's okay to ask for what you need.

Regarding the salsa class, try approaching the instructor beforehand to express your concerns and ask for any additional support they might offer. This may help alleviate some of your social anxiety.

I'm glad to hear that you are exploring mindfulness-based sleep interventions. Keep me updated on how that goes.

Lastly, remember to be kind to yourself. Change takes time, and it's important to practice self-compassion throughout this process.

Looking forward to our next session. Until then, take care and keep up the good work!
