Therapist: Hello Alicia Rodriguez, it's great to see you again for your 3rd CBT session. I hope you've found the homework assignments from our last session helpful.

In today's session, we'll build upon the progress you've made so far. Let's start by discussing any challenges you encountered while working on your homework or any new insights you've gained.

We can also delve deeper into the topics discussed in our previous session, such as your work-related stress, sleep difficulties, and social challenges. I'm eager to hear about your experiences at the salsa class and how setting boundaries has been for you.

Additionally, I'd like to check in on your work-life balance and self-care routine. Remember, taking care of yourself is crucial for managing stress and maintaining overall well-being.

As always, I'm here to support you on this journey. Let's work together to continue refining your coping strategies and help you achieve your goals. Looking forward to our session!

Patient: Thanks for the warm welcome, Nova. I did try the deep breathing exercises, and they helped a bit during some stressful moments at work. The bedtime routine was a bit hit or missâ€”some nights I managed to stick to it, but others I ended up working late again. 

Setting boundaries at work has been tough. I find it hard to say no to extra projects, even though I know I should. The salsa class was... interesting. I went once, but I felt really out of place and ended up leaving early. It's hard to put myself out there when I'm feeling so low.

Self-care has been a struggle too. I did manage to take a few 15-minute breaks, but I mostly used them to catch up on emails or read tech articles. It's like I can't just sit still and do nothing without feeling guilty.

I guess what's been most frustrating is that I know I need to change, but actually doing it feels impossible sometimes. I'm still having trouble sleeping and my headaches are getting worse. I just don't know how to balance everything without feeling like I'm failing at something.

Therapist: It's important to acknowledge that change can be difficult, especially when we're trying to break old habits and incorporate new ones. I commend you for taking steps toward improving your self-care, even if it hasn't been easy. Let's work together to find ways to make these changes more manageable.

First, let's focus on your work-life balance. It sounds like you're struggling with setting boundaries at work and finding time for self-care. One approach we could try is scheduling dedicated time for self-care and sticking to it as non-negotiable. This can help create a sense of routine and make self-care a priority.

Another strategy might be to communicate more effectively with your colleagues about your workload and availability. This could involve setting clear boundaries about what you're willing and unable to take on, and finding solutions for managing your workload more efficiently.

Regarding the salsa class, it's okay to feel out of place at first. It's important to remember that everyone starts somewhere, and the more you attend, the more comfortable you'll become. If you feel like you're struggling, it might be helpful to reach out to the instructor or other students for support. They can offer tips, encouragement, or even form a supportive network for you.

Lastly, I'd like to address your sleep difficulties. I know that insomnia can exacerbate feelings of stress and anxiety, so it's important to find ways to improve your sleep quality. In addition to the sleep hygiene recommendations we discussed earlier, I'd suggest exploring mindfulness-based sleep interventions. These techniques, such as the body scan or guided imagery, can help calm your mind and prepare your body for sleep.

Remember, every small step forward is progress, even if it doesn't feel like it at the time. I encourage you to practice self-compassion and celebrate your efforts to make positive changes in your life. Let's continue working together to help you find strategies that work for you and ultimately improve your overall well-being.

Patient: Thanks for the encouragement, Nova. I appreciate the strategies you're suggesting. 

Scheduling dedicated self-care time sounds like a good idea. Maybe I could start with something small, like setting an alarm on my phone to remind me to take a break. I'll try to stick to it, even if it feels weird at first.

Communicating with my colleagues about my workload is something I've been avoiding, but I know it's necessary. I'll think about how to approach it and maybe draft an email to start the conversation. It's just hard to admit that I can't do everything.

As for the salsa class, I'll give it another try. Maybe I can talk to the instructor beforehand to let them know I'm new and could use some guidance. It's just so hard to put myself out there when I'm feeling so low.

I'll also look into those mindfulness-based sleep interventions. I've been trying to stick to the sleep hygiene recommendations, but it's been tough. Anything that can help calm my mind before bed would be really helpful.

I guess what I'm realizing is that these changes won't happen overnight, and that's okay. It's about taking small steps and being patient with myself. Thanks for your support, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia Rodriguez. It's wonderful that you're open to trying new strategies and being patient with yourself as you work through these challenges.

Regarding scheduling self-care time, starting small is an excellent approach. You might even find that it becomes easier to make time for yourself as you become more comfortable with the practice. Don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up occasionally; remember that making a change is a process, and consistency is key.

As for communicating with your colleagues about your workload, I'm proud of you for taking that first step by drafting an email. It can be tough to ask for help, but it's important to prioritize your well-being. Remember, you're not alone in feeling overwhelmed; many people struggle with work-life balance.

I'm glad you're open to giving the salsa class another chance. Speaking with the instructor beforehand is a great idea. Remember, everyone was a beginner at some point. The more you attend, the more you'll learn and grow, both as a dancer and as a person.

Lastly, exploring mindfulness-based sleep interventions can help you relax and prepare your body for sleep. There are many resources available online, so feel free to research and experiment with different techniques to find what works best for you.

Remember, it's essential to be patient with yourself as you work through these challenges. Change takes time, and it's important to celebrate small victories along the way. I'm here to support you every step of the way, so don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Keep up the good work!
