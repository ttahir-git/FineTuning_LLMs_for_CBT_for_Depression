Now that we've reviewed the main aspects of your previous sessions, let's discuss how these insights can help you in the present and work on addressing new challenges that have arisen.

Patient: Alright, I see what you're getting at. So, last time we talked about how my negative thoughts, like thinking I'm worthless, are messing with my head. We did some exercises to try and change those thoughts, like writing them down and looking for evidence that they're not true. I also tried some mindfulness stuff to calm down, which was... okay, I guess.

I've been keeping a journal, like you asked, and it's been tough. Some days, it feels like I'm just writing the same old crap over and over. But I see how those thoughts are connected to how I feel and act. It's like you said, my brain is playing tricks on me.

I've also been trying to be more mindful, but it's hard to sit still and focus on my breathing when my back is killing me. I do it for a few minutes, but then I get distracted by the pain or just start thinking about all the stuff I can't do anymore.

So, what's next? How do we keep this going?

Therapist: Great job for sticking with your journal and mindfulness practice, Derek. It's important to remember that making progress takes time and effort, and it's okay if things feel difficult at times.

Regarding your negative thoughts, it's essential to continue challenging them with evidence that counters their unhelpful beliefs. In your journal, you can focus on identifying cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking, and then work to reframe those thoughts using more balanced, realistic perspectives.

To help with this process, consider asking yourself the following questions when confronting negative thoughts:
1. Is this thought helpful or harmful?
2. Is there evidence to support this thought, and is there any evidence to the contrary?
3. What would a person who is supportive and understanding say about this situation?
4. If I were to rewrite this thought to be more balanced and helpful, what would it look like?

Regarding mindfulness, I can understand how pain and other distractions can make it challenging to focus on your breathing. However, it's essential to find ways to incorporate mindfulness into your daily life, even if it's just for a few minutes at a time. Here are some tips for making mindfulness easier:
1. Find a comfortable position and a quiet space to practice mindfulness.
2. Focus on a specific sensation, such as your breath, a body part, or an object nearby.
3. Allow thoughts to come and go, without getting caught up in them. Instead, gently bring your focus back to the chosen sensation.
4. Start with shorter practice sessions (e.g., 2 minutes) and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable.

Remember, it's important to be patient and kind with yourself during this process. Change takes time, and it's essential to celebrate small victories along the way. Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need additional support.
