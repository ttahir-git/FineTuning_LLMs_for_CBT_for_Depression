Therapist: Hello Derek Olsen! It's great to see you again for your 7th Cognitive Behavioral Therapy session. Let's discuss your progress since our last meeting.

In our 6th session, we talked about various strategies for pain management, alcohol reduction, and introduced the concepts of mindfulness and cognitive restructuring. I'm glad you showed an increased openness to trying new techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, and setting realistic goals for reducing alcohol consumption.

During the session, we identified that you made some helpful discoveries. You began acknowledging the connection between your pain and alcohol use, as well as your willingness to explore alternative coping mechanisms. Recognizing the importance of dealing with cravings and triggers, and expressing readiness to make small, manageable changes, were significant realizations as well.

Moving forward, it's important to maintain the momentum gained in our previous sessions. I encourage you to continue practicing the relaxation techniques we've discussed for pain management, and set realistic goals for reducing alcohol consumption. Additionally, I'd like you to begin identifying personal triggers for drinking.

As you continue on this journey, I'm here to support and guide you through any challenges you may encounter. Let's make the most of our remaining sessions to help you overcome your obstacles and lead a healthier, more fulfilling life.

Looking forward to our next session! Until then, take care.
