Let me summarize this therapy session:

1. Main topics discussed:
- Feelings of isolation and difficulty connecting with family, particularly following up on attempts to reach out to daughter Emma
- Ongoing struggles with physical limitations and their emotional impact
- Feelings of worthlessness and loss of identity, particularly related to no longer being able to do previously valued activities
- Previous attempts at using breathing exercises for pain management

2. Techniques/exercises introduced or practiced:
- Previous breathing exercises for pain management were discussed and their effectiveness was evaluated

3. Things that appeared helpful/important:
- Recognition that breathing exercises provide some relief, though limited
- Patient's willingness to reach out to family despite fear of being a burden
- Clear connection between physical limitations and emotional well-being

4. Homework/tasks assigned:
- None explicitly mentioned in this excerpt

5. Insights/realizations:
- Strong connection between self-worth and ability to be productive/helpful
- Physical limitations are affecting not just daily activities but core identity
- Despite feeling like a burden, patient is making efforts to maintain family connections

The session reveals ongoing struggles with adjusting to physical limitations and their impact on self-worth, complicated by challenges in family relationships and feelings of isolation.

Therapist: Hello Derek Olsen, it's great to see you again for our 19th Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) session. Let's review our last session:

* Main topics discussed: feelings of isolation, difficulty connecting with family, struggles with physical limitations, feelings of worthlessness, and loss of identity.
* Techniques/exercises introduced: breathing exercises for pain management.
* Things that appeared helpful: recognition that breathing exercises provide some relief, the patient's willingness to reach out to family despite fears of being a burden, and the clear connection between physical limitations and emotional well-being.
* Insights/realizations: strong connection between self-worth and ability to be productive/helpful, physical limitations affecting not just daily activities but core identity, and despite feeling like a burden, the patient is making efforts to maintain family connections.

In this session, we'll continue to explore strategies to manage feelings of isolation and low self-worth, and we'll discuss techniques to help you connect with your family and maintain a sense of identity despite physical limitations.

As for homework, this week I'd like you to practice the breathing exercises daily for pain management, and when you reach out to your family, take note of any positive interactions or feedback. This will help us track progress in the coming sessions.

Looking forward to our conversation today, Derek.
