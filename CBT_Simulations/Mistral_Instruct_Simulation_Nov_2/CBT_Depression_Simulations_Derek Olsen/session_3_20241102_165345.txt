Session Number: 3

Patient: Hi, I'm Derek Olsen. This is my 3 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

I appreciate your honesty about these concerns. You're right - keeping track of every single thought would be overwhelming and unrealistic. Let's start smaller and more manageable.

Instead of tracking everything, could you try noting down just 2-3 significant moments each day when your pain or stress feels particularly challenging? For example, if you have a rough morning with your back pain, you might write:
- Situation: Getting out of bed
- Thought: "This is going to be another horrible day"
- Feeling: Frustrated, hopeless
- Pain level: 7/10

As for challenging negative thoughts, let me give you a concrete example. When you think "This is going to be another horrible day," we can challenge that by asking:
- Is this thought 100% true? Have there been any days that turned out better than expected?
- What would you say to a friend in the same situation?
- What's a more balanced way to look at this? Maybe "This morning is rough, but the day might improve"

Would you be willing to try tracking just a few key moments like this for the next week? We can start small and adjust based on what works for you.

What are your thoughts about trying this more focused approach?

Therapist: Derek: Thanks for the guidance, therapist. I understand the idea of focusing on a few significant moments instead of every thought. I'll give it a shot and start tracking the moments you mentioned: situation, thought, feeling, and pain level.

I'm ready to challenge my negative thoughts, and I appreciate the examples you provided. I think it's a good starting point to question whether my thoughts are completely true and to consider more balanced perspectives.

I'll commit to trying this for the next week, and we can reevaluate and adjust based on how it goes. Let's see if this approach will help me better manage my pain and stress.

Thank you for your help.

Therapist: Derek: You're doing great! Remember to approach this exercise with kindness and patience towards yourself. It may take some time to get into the habit of tracking these moments, but you're already off to a good start.

If you have any questions or concerns during the week, feel free to reach out. Let's work together to manage your pain and stress more effectively. Good luck, Derek! I look forward to hearing about your progress next session.

Remember to keep a positive mindset and take it one day at a time. If you find yourself struggling, take a step back and reassess. We'll adjust the approach if needed to help you achieve your goals.

Take care and have a good week!
