Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again! In our previous session, we discussed the thought tracking approach, which involves understanding your thoughts, feelings, and pain levels in significant moments. You showed a willingness to challenge negative thoughts and find more balanced perspectives.

This week, I encourage you to continue tracking significant moments using the situation-thought-feeling-pain structure. Also, practice challenging negative thoughts and reframe them in a more balanced and helpful way. Remember, it's not about eliminating negative thoughts, but rather understanding their impact and finding healthier ways to cope.

I'd like you to monitor your pain and stress levels as you go about your week. This will help you see the connection between your thoughts and how they affect your physical and emotional well-being.

Remember, this process takes time, and it's normal to have setbacks. What's important is that you keep trying and learning from your experiences.

Let's meet again next week to discuss your progress and any challenges you've encountered. Until then, take care and keep up the good work!
