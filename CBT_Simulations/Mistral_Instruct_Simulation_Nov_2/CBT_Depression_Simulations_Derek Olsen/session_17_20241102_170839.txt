4. Previous homework discussed:
- Thought journaling (completed but finding it repetitive)
- Mindfulness practice (attempted but challenging due to physical pain)

5. Key insights/realizations:
- Acknowledgment that negative thoughts are distortions ("brain playing tricks")

The session revealed both progress in understanding cognitive concepts and practical challenges in implementing techniques, particularly due to physical pain. This suggests a need to adapt mindfulness approaches to accommodate physical limitations and possibly refresh the thought journaling approach to maintain engagement.

Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again for our 17th CBT session! I appreciate the detailed summary of our previous session, it helps me understand your current state better.

You've made significant progress in recognizing and understanding cognitive distortions, as well as the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. I'm glad to see that you've been able to engage with the homework assignments, even though you've found them challenging at times.

Regarding your physical pain and its impact on your mindfulness practice, I agree that it's indeed a significant barrier. Let's explore some mindfulness techniques that might be more suitable for your physical condition, such as body scan meditation or loving-kindness meditation. These practices focus less on posture and more on mental awareness and compassion, which might be more manageable for you.

As for your thought journaling, I understand your frustration with its repetitive nature. To keep the practice engaging, we could try to vary the techniques you use, such as creating thought records, looking for alternative perspectives, or identifying and challenging core beliefs.

In our next session, let's discuss these adaptations further and see if they help address your challenges. Don't hesitate to practice these new techniques in the meantime and note your experiences in your journal. I look forward to hearing about your progress!

If you have any questions or concerns before our next session, please feel free to reach out. Take care!
