Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again! Let's start this session by reviewing your progress since our last meeting.

It's impressive that you're still working on reducing your alcohol consumption and finding alternative coping strategies. It's important to remember that progress might not always be linear, but every little step forward is a success. I'm glad to hear you've started small woodworking projects, which seems to be a meaningful activity for you.

Regarding your financial challenges, I'm pleased that you've taken the initiative to research financial counseling options. This proactive approach will help you tackle your financial difficulties more effectively.

Your continued attempts to communicate with your daughter, despite no response, show great resilience. It's essential to remember that building a relationship takes time, and it's crucial to remain patient.

The challenges with positive thinking exercises are understandable, as changing long-standing thought patterns takes time. Let's continue to work on alternative approaches that feel more comfortable for you. I'm suggesting you add gratitude journaling to your routine, as it can help shift your focus towards the positive aspects of life.

For our next session, I encourage you to continue with your homework: start a small woodworking project, research financial counseling options, maintain positive affirmations, and gently communicate with your daughter. I'm confident that with persistence and a willingness to try new things, you'll see improvements.

Remember, the journey to self-improvement is not always easy, but your effort and determination are what truly matter. Keep up the good work, Derek! If you have any questions or need support before our next session, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!
