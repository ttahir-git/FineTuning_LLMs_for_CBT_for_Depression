Therapist: Hello Samantha Chen, it's great to see you again for this 15th CBT session! Let's delve into our previous discussion and review your progress.

Last session, we explored topics such as sleep issues and nighttime anxiety, cognitive restructuring challenges, work-life balance, business-related stress, and self-compassion during the change process.

You've been practicing techniques such as using a relaxation app for sleep, mindfulness during work breaks, yoga, and meditation, and cognitive restructuring exercises. It seems that the relaxation app has shown positive results for improving your sleep, and brief mindfulness practices integrated into your work schedule have been beneficial as well.

I'm glad that you've realized that change takes time and patience, and that you understand the importance of self-care alongside work responsibilities. Additionally, acknowledging that perfectionism in business decisions may be counterproductive and acceptance that setbacks are a normal part of the healing process are important insights.

For this session, let's continue focusing on implementing work-life balance, maintaining your yoga and meditation practice, practicing cognitive restructuring techniques, and ensuring that you're taking care of yourself throughout this change process.

Remember, setbacks are a normal part of progress, and it's important to be patient with yourself. Keep up the great work, Samantha!

Patient: Hi Nova. It's good to be back. Last week was rough, I'll admit. The relaxation app is helping, but I still had a couple nights where I was up until 3 AM again. The anxiety just hits me out of nowhere.

I've been trying to stick to the mindfulness breaks during the day, but it's hard when I feel like I'm constantly behind on GreenThread. I had to redo a whole collection because I wasn't happy with the materials. I know you've warned me about perfectionism, but it feels impossible not to obsess over every detail.

Yoga and meditation have helped some, but I skipped both on Monday and Tuesday. I just didn't have the energy to keep up with it all. I know it's a bad habit to let slide when I'm already overwhelmed.

Work-life balance is still a struggle. Sometimes I feel so guilty when I take even an hour for myself. Like I'm wasting precious time I could be spending on the business. I wish I knew how to fully turn work off when I'm not in the office.

I had a rough conversation with my mom last weekend. She basically told me she thinks I'm a failure for quitting my corporate job. I know she's just worried, but it really pushed me into a downward spiral. I've been beating myself up over it ever since. Not sure

Therapist: how to respond to her or how to stop the negative self-talk. It's important to remember that your decision to leave your corporate job was a brave step towards finding a career that aligns with your values and brings you fulfillment.

Regarding your sleep issues, let's focus on developing a consistent bedtime routine and sticking to it as much as possible. This can help regulate your sleep patterns and reduce nighttime anxiety. It's understandable that anxiety can strike at unexpected moments, but remember to practice deep breathing exercises or other relaxation techniques when it does.

With regards to work-life balance, it's crucial to set boundaries and make time for self-care. You might find it helpful to designate specific hours for work and stick to them, ensuring you also have dedicated time for personal activities and relaxation. It's essential not to guilt yourself for taking time for yourself, as this can actually worsen feelings of stress and burnout.

When it comes to perfectionism, it's important to recognize that it can hinder progress and lead to unnecessary stress. Aim for progress rather than perfection. Take small steps towards your goals, and remember that it's okay if things don't turn out perfectly the first time.

Lastly, regarding your conversation with your mom, it's essential to communicate with her about your feelings. Explain that you're working hard to find a balance between work and personal life and that her support is important to you. Encourage her to express her concerns in a supportive and understanding manner. You might also find it helpful to seek support from friends, family members, or a therapist to help manage these feelings.

As for your missed yoga and meditation sessions, it's understandable that it can be difficult to stick to a routine when feeling overwhelmed. However, it's important to prioritize self-care activities like these to help manage stress and improve overall well-being. You could try setting a reminder or finding a friend to hold you accountable for your practice.

Keep up the hard work, Samantha. Progress takes time, and setbacks are a normal part of the journey. You've made great strides, and I have no doubt that you will continue to do so.

Patient: Thanks for the encouragement, Nova. I appreciate it.

I've been trying to stick to a bedtime routine, but it's hard when my mind is racing with thoughts about the business. I'll try to be more consistent with it though. Maybe if I start winding down earlier, I can get my brain to settle before I try to sleep.

Setting work boundaries is something I really struggle with. I've tried to designate specific work hours, but it's hard when I feel like there's always something urgent that needs my attention. I know I need to be more disciplined about it, but it feels like I'm constantly playing catch-up.

I've been trying to remind myself that progress, not perfection, is the goal. It's just so ingrained in me to want everything to be perfect. I'll keep working on it though.

Talking to my mom about how I feel is something I've been avoiding. I know it would help, but it's hard to open up to her about this stuff. She's always been so critical, and I don't want to hear more negativity. I'll think about how to approach it though. Maybe I can start with a letter or email, so I have time to organize my thoughts.

I'll try to get back into my yoga and meditation routine. Maybe setting a reminder on my phone will help me remember to

Therapist: practice consistently. It's also worth considering finding a local yoga or meditation group, as the support and accountability of others can be helpful in maintaining a practice.

In terms of managing your thoughts and anxiety before sleep, you may find it helpful to practice journaling before bed. This can help you process your thoughts and worries, and allow you to let them go before trying to sleep.

Regarding work boundaries, it can be helpful to set specific hours for responding to emails and messages. This can help you avoid feeling like you're constantly "on call" and give you time to focus on other aspects of your life.

If talking to your mom is difficult, it's okay to start small. You can begin by expressing your appreciation for her concern and then sharing how you feel about the situation. Remember that it's important to approach conversations with loved ones with empathy and understanding, as they may not fully understand the challenges you're facing.

Keep up the good work, Samantha. You're doing great, and don't forget to be kind to yourself along the way. Progress takes time, and it's important to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small they may seem.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the suggestions.

Journaling before bed sounds like a good idea. I've been trying to do it more regularly, but I'll make a point to do it every night before I try to sleep. Maybe it will help me clear my mind and get some rest.

Setting specific hours for emails and messages is something I can definitely try. I think that might help me feel less overwhelmed by the constant demands on my time. I'll start with blocking off certain hours in the morning and afternoon for work-related communication.

Talking to my mom is still a tough one. I think I'll start with a letter, like you suggested. It gives me time to think about what I want to say and how to express my feelings without getting defensive. I hope it helps bridge the gap between us.

I'll look into finding a local yoga or meditation group too. It might be nice to have some support and accountability. I know I need to prioritize self-care more, especially when things get stressful.

Thanks for the encouragement. It's easy to get caught up in the negative thoughts and forget to celebrate the small wins. I'll try to be more mindful of that moving forward.

Therapist: Great, Samantha. Keep up the great work and remember to be patient with yourself. Small changes can lead to significant improvements over time. Here are some additional suggestions:

1. Journaling before bed: As you mentioned, journaling can be a helpful way to process your thoughts and worries. Try to write down three things that went well during the day, no matter how small. This can help you focus on the positive aspects of your life and go to sleep with a more positive mindset.
2. Work-life balance: It's essential to prioritize self-care and personal time, especially when work demands are high. Set specific hours for work-related tasks, as you mentioned, and try to stick to them as much as possible. If necessary, communicate with your team or clients about your availability to help manage expectations.
3. Mindfulness: Incorporate mindfulness practices into your daily routine, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises. These can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being.
4. Self-compassion: Practice self-compassion by treating yourself with kindness and understanding. Remember that everyone has setbacks and struggles, and it's okay to ask for help or take a break when needed.
5. Support system: Lean on your support system, whether it's friends, family members, or a therapist. Don't be afraid to reach out when you're feeling overwhelmed or need help.
6. Progress, not perfection: Continue reminding yourself that progress, not perfection, is the goal. Celebrate your small wins and recognize that growth takes time.
7. Cognitive restructuring: Continue practicing cognitive restructuring techniques to challenge negative thoughts and beliefs. Identify irrational or unhelpful thoughts and replace them with more realistic and helpful ones.
8. Self-care: Make sure to prioritize self-care activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as spending time with loved ones, reading, or engaging in a hobby.
9. Work-life balance: Establish boundaries with work, such as designating specific hours for responding to emails and messages, taking breaks during the day, and disconnecting from work during non-work hours.
10. Communication: Practice open and honest communication with your loved ones about your feelings and needs. Share your thoughts and concerns in a respectful and compassionate manner, and encourage them to do the same.

Patient: Thanks for the additional suggestions, Nova. I appreciate all the tips.

Journaling three positive things each night sounds like a good way to shift my focus before bed. I'll definitely give that a try. It might help me end the day on a more positive note.

Setting boundaries with work is still a challenge, but I'm getting better at it. I've started communicating my availability to my team, which has helped manage expectations. It's a work in progress, but I'm making strides.

Mindfulness practices have been a lifesaver. Even just a few minutes of deep breathing or meditation can help me reset during the day. I'll keep incorporating them into my routine.

Self-compassion is something I struggle with, but I'm trying to be kinder to myself. It's hard to break the habit of being so critical, but I know it's important for my mental health.

I've been leaning on my support system more, especially my partner Michael. He's been really understanding and supportive, which has made a big difference. I'm also considering reaching out to a few close friends who have been encouraging.

Progress, not perfection, is a mantra I'm trying to live by. It's still tough to let go of that perfectionist mindset, but I'm getting better at recognizing when it's holding me back.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're finding these strategies helpful, Samantha. It's important to remember that change takes time, and setbacks are a normal part of the process. Keep practicing self-compassion and leaning on your support system, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.

In terms of cognitive restructuring, let's continue working on identifying and challenging negative thoughts. When you notice a negative thought or belief, try to examine it and determine if it's based in reality. If it's not, try to replace it with a more realistic and helpful thought.

It's also important to focus on the present moment and not dwell too much on past mistakes or future fears. Mindfulness techniques can help with this. Practice being present and focused on what's happening in the moment.

In regards to work-life balance, keep setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care. Make time for the activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Remember that it's okay to take breaks and disconnect from work during non-work hours.

Continue communicating openly and honestly with your loved ones about your feelings and needs. Encourage them to do the same. It's important to have open and respectful conversations to build a strong and supportive relationship.

Keep up the good work, Samantha. You're making progress, and I have no doubt that you will continue to do so. If you need anything, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you.
