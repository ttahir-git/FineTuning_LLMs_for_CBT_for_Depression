This session revealed the need to potentially adjust approaches to better support the client's anxiety management and meditation practice, acknowledging that developing new coping skills is a gradual process.

Therapist: Hello Samantha, thank you for coming back for another session. It sounds like we have some areas to focus on, and I appreciate your honesty about the challenges you've been experiencing. Let's break down your concerns and see how we can work together to find solutions.

1. Ongoing anxiety about the upcoming presentation: It's completely normal to feel anxious about public speaking. One approach we could try is a technique called exposure therapy. This would involve gradually exposing yourself to the anxiety-provoking situation (in this case, speaking in front of others) to help reduce your fear and increase your confidence. We can work together to develop a plan to practice this in a safe and controlled environment, such as speaking in front of friends or family, or even recording yourself and watching it back for self-evaluation.

2. Challenges with mindfulness meditation practice: It's important to remember that mind wandering during meditation is a common occurrence, and it's not a sign of failure. Instead, when your mind wanders, acknowledge the thought, let it go, and refocus on your breath. You might find it helpful to set a specific goal for your meditation sessions, such as focusing on your breath for five minutes at a time. As you become more comfortable with this, you can gradually increase your meditation time.

3. Difficulty with thought reframing despite attempts: Thoughts are like clouds in the sky; they pass by, and we don't have to hold onto them. When you find yourself struggling with negative thoughts, take a step back and ask yourself if these thoughts are helping you in any way. If they aren't, consider reframing them using more positive, helpful, and realistic thoughts. It might be helpful to write down your negative thoughts and then rewrite them as positive statements.

Before we finish today, let's discuss some additional homework. In addition to continuing your mindfulness meditation practice, I'd like you to practice exposure therapy by finding a safe and controlled environment where you can practice speaking in front of others. This could be your friends, family, or even a mirror. As you become more comfortable, we can discuss strategies for applying these skills to your upcoming presentation.

Remember that developing new coping skills takes time and practice, so be gentle with yourself as you work through these exercises. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out between sessions. I'm here to support you throughout this process.

Have a great week, and I look forward to speaking with you again soon!
