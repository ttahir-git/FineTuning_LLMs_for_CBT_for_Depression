Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again for your third CBT session. Last time we discussed several important topics, such as sleep hygiene, eating habits, communication strategies with parents, cognitive reappraisal techniques, and a business problem-solving approach for GreenThread.

It's wonderful to hear that you found the concrete examples of cognitive reappraisal, the detailed breakdown of the business problem-solving method, and the balanced approach to parent communication helpful and important.

As we discussed, I'd like to encourage you to continue practicing cognitive reappraisal with any worrying thoughts that come up, and to implement the sleep hygiene practices we discussed. I'd also like you to monitor your eating habits and apply the problem-solving approach to business issues as homework.

In addition, I'd like you to plan a conversation with your parents using the new communication strategy we discussed. Remember, it's a combination of gratitude and assertiveness, so you can express your feelings while also being respectful.

I'm glad to hear that you've realized the value of small shifts in thinking and the importance of breaking problems down into manageable parts. These insights are crucial for our work together and I look forward to seeing your progress.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to let me know. Have a great week, and I'll see you next time.
