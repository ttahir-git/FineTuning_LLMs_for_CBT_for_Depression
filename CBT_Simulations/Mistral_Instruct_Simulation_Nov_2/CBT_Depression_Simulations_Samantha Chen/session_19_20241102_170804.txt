Session Number: 19

Patient: Hi, I'm Samantha Chen. This is my 19 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session terminated due to error: RetryError[<Future at 0x71d970313b80 state=finished raised ValueError>]

Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's nice to see you again. I apologize for the technical issue we experienced during our last session. Let's make sure we have a smooth session today. If you'd like, we can review where we left off or start with something new. What would you prefer to focus on today?

Patient: Hi Nova, it's okay, no worries about the last session. I think it might be helpful to pick up where we left off. I was feeling pretty overwhelmed with the business and my family situation. I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping again, and I'm not sure how to break that cycle.

Therapist: Of course, Samantha. Let's start by discussing the thoughts and feelings you have when you're finding it difficult to sleep. It can be helpful to identify any specific triggers or patterns that might be contributing to your sleep problems. Once we have a better understanding of those factors, we can work together to develop coping strategies to help you manage your sleep more effectively.

One common cognitive distortion in sleep problems is catastrophizing, which is the tendency to overestimate the negative consequences of not sleeping. Can you think of any examples of thoughts you might have when you're struggling to sleep that seem excessive or unhelpful? Recognizing these thoughts and learning to challenge them can be an effective way to manage your sleep difficulties.

In addition to addressing your sleep issues, let's also discuss the business and family situations that have been causing you stress. We've talked about using cognitive restructuring to help manage these stressors, and we can continue to explore ways to approach them more effectively. Do you have any specific concerns or questions that you'd like to focus on today?

Patient: When I'm struggling to sleep, I often find myself thinking about all the things that could go wrong with GreenThread. I worry that I'll fail and lose everything, including the respect of my family. I also have thoughts like, "What if I'm not cut out for this?" or "What if I made a huge mistake by leaving my old job?" These thoughts make it hard to relax and fall asleep.

As for the business and family stress, I'm really concerned about the financial aspect. I've invested so much, and the pressure to succeed is overwhelming. My parents' disapproval is also a big source of stress. They keep questioning my decisions, and it feels like they're constantly disappointed in me. I want to find a way to handle this better, but I'm not sure how.

Therapist: It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed with the various stressors in your life, Samantha. Let's focus on the thoughts you're having about GreenThread that are contributing to your sleep difficulties. As I mentioned earlier, one common cognitive distortion in these situations is catastrophizing, or overestimating the negative consequences of a situation.

In your case, you're catastrophizing by thinking about all the possible negative outcomes of GreenThread failing, such as losing everything and disappointing your family. To help manage these thoughts, try to identify evidence that contradicts your catastrophic beliefs. For example, think about the things you've accomplished so far, such as launching GreenThread, securing investors, and growing the business. Reframe your thoughts to be more balanced and realistic, focusing on what you can control and what steps you can take to address any challenges.

It's also important to challenge the thought, "What if I'm not cut out for this?" Remember, it's normal to feel uncertain or unsure at times, especially when you're taking on a new challenge like starting a business. Instead, focus on your strengths, skills, and the support you have from others. You've demonstrated resilience and determination in pursuing your goals, so try to remind yourself of these qualities when you're feeling doubtful.

Regarding the financial and familial stress, it can be helpful to set realistic expectations for yourself and your business. Recognize that there will be challenges and setbacks along the way, but stay focused on your goals and the progress you're making.

As for your parents' disapproval, it's essential to communicate your intentions and decisions clearly to them. If possible, try to find a way to have an open and honest conversation with them about your aspirations for GreenThread and the reasons why you've chosen this path. If their disapproval continues, try to focus on your own sense of self-worth and the positive aspects of your life, rather than seeking their validation.

Let's continue to work on these thoughts and strategies during our next session, and in the meantime, try to practice cognitive restructuring as you encounter stressors in your day-to-day life. Remember, it takes time and effort to develop new habits, but with persistence and self-compassion, you can make progress towards a more balanced and restful sleep.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate the strategies you've suggested. I'll try to focus on the positive aspects of GreenThread and remind myself of what I've already accomplished. It's hard to ignore the negative thoughts, but I understand that challenging them can help.

As for my parents, I've tried talking to them, but it often ends in arguments. I think I need to find a way to communicate better and maybe even set some boundaries. It's tough because I want their support, but I also need to stay true to myself and my vision for GreenThread.

I'll also work on setting realistic expectations for the business and myself. It's easy to get caught up in the pressure to succeed quickly, but I know that's not realistic. I'll try to focus on the progress I'm making and not just the end goal.

Thank you for your guidance. I'll practice these strategies and see how they work for me.

Therapist: You're welcome, Samantha. I'm glad you found the strategies helpful, and I encourage you to be patient with yourself as you implement them. It's important to remember that changing long-standing thought patterns can take time, and it's essential to practice self-compassion throughout the process.

Regarding your parents, it's great that you're considering setting boundaries. Communication is key, and finding a way to communicate more effectively with them will not only help manage their disapproval but also strengthen your relationship with them. Consider seeking support from a family therapist or counselor if you feel overwhelmed by the conversations with your parents.

Regarding setting realistic expectations, it's important to remember that success doesn't happen overnight. Focus on the small steps you're taking to move forward with GreenThread and celebrate those achievements along the way. This will help you stay motivated and focused on your goals.

I'm here to support you during this process, and feel free to reach out if you need more guidance or have any questions. Good luck, and I look forward to our next session!

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I'll definitely keep practicing self-compassion and try to focus on the small steps I'm taking with GreenThread. It's easy to get discouraged, but I know that staying positive and realistic will help me in the long run.

As for my parents, I'll consider seeking support from a family therapist. It might be helpful to have an impartial person guide those conversations. I want to maintain a good relationship with them, even if we don't always see eye to eye.

I appreciate your support, Nova. I'll keep working on these strategies and look forward to our next session.

Therapist: You're welcome, Samantha. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful about the strategies we've discussed. Remember, it's important to be patient with yourself as you work on changing long-standing thought patterns and habits.

If you find that the strategies we've discussed aren't working as effectively as you'd like or if you're having difficulty implementing them, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you and help you find solutions that work best for you.

Regarding your parents, seeking support from a family therapist or counselor can be very helpful. They can provide guidance and strategies for improving communication and managing difficult relationships. It's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being, and seeking professional help is a positive step towards that goal.

In the meantime, try to focus on the positive aspects of your life and the progress you're making with GreenThread. It's essential to celebrate your achievements and remember that success takes time and effort.

Take care, and I look forward to speaking with you again soon.
