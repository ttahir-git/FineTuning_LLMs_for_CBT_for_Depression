Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again for our 7th CBT session! I appreciate your effort in reflecting on our previous session.

Let me start by congratulating you on your progress. I can see that you're becoming more aware of your thoughts and emotions, and that you're taking active steps towards addressing your challenges.

In today's session, we discussed various topics including your progress with previous homework, difficulties with parents regarding career choices, sleep issues related to family conflicts, and communication challenges. We also introduced some new techniques such as active listening, empathy strategies, assertive communication using "I" statements, boundary setting techniques, and problem-solving approaches for family conflicts.

It's fantastic to hear that these strategies seemed helpful for you, especially the recognition of the importance of active listening and empathy during conversations with parents. I also appreciate your realization of the need for balance between setting boundaries and maintaining family relationships.

For our homework this week, I encourage you to practice active listening and empathy during conversations with your parents, continue with your previous homework (thought challenging and daily goals), and implement boundary setting techniques.

Remember, it's important to be patient with yourself as these changes take time. Keep in mind that our ultimate goal is to help you manage your anxiety and improve your overall quality of life.

Looking forward to our next session! If you have any questions or concerns before then, don't hesitate to reach out.
