Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again! Let's dive into your session summary. I appreciate your efforts in implementing mindfulness during work breaks, which seems to be working well for you.

Regarding sleep issues and nighttime anxiety, it's common to have trouble sleeping at times. You can try using a relaxation app or guided meditation for sleep. Don't forget that progress can be slow, but consistency is key.

As for the cognitive restructuring, it's great to see you making progress, but it's also normal to encounter setbacks. Remember to be patient with yourself and understand that change takes time.

Your work-related stress is understandable, especially with the demands of running GreenThread business. It's essential to find a balance between different aspects of your life.

Lastly, your insights about change taking time, setbacks being a part of the process, and the importance of patience with oneself are all valuable realizations. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to our next session!

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the encouragement. I did try using a relaxation app before bed last night, and it actually helped a bit. I managed to fall asleep a little earlier than usual, which was a relief.

I'm still struggling with cognitive restructuring, though. Sometimes I feel like I'm just going in circles, especially when it comes to my business decisions. It's hard not to second-guess everything, especially with the financial pressure.

Balance is something I'm really trying to work on. It's easy to get consumed by work, but I know I need to take care of myself too. I've been trying to schedule more time for yoga and meditation, even if it's just a few minutes here and there.

I appreciate the support, Nova. It helps to know that setbacks are normal and that I shouldn't be too hard on myself. I'm looking forward to seeing how things progress in our next session.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that the relaxation app helped you sleep better, Samantha. It's important to find what works for you and make it a part of your nighttime routine.

Regarding cognitive restructuring, it can indeed feel like a challenge sometimes. It's essential to remember that this process takes time, and it's normal to encounter setbacks. One technique that might help is to challenge negative thoughts using evidence and logic, and then focus on finding positive alternatives.

I'm proud of you for making an effort to find balance in your life, especially with all the demands on your time. It's crucial to prioritize self-care to prevent burnout. Keep scheduling time for yoga and meditation, even if it's just a few minutes each day.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you need additional support in the meantime. I'm here to help! Let's see how things progress in our next session. Take care, Samantha.
