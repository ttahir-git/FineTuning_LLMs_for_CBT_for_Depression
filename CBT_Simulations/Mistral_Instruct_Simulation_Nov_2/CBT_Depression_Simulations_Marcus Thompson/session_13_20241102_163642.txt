Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for session 13. Last time we discussed your progress with self-compassion practice, boundary-setting experiences with students, mindfulness and journaling practice, negative self-talk patterns, and various techniques to help manage them.

From our previous session, it seems you've made some good progress. You've identified specific patterns of negative self-talk and have maintained consistency with mindfulness and journaling practices. Additionally, you've successfully had difficult conversations with students about boundaries, which is fantastic.

Keep up the great work, Marcus! Let's make the most of our time today.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's good to be back. I appreciate the summary of our last session—it helps to keep things in perspective.

Let's start with the self-compassion exercises. I've been trying to practice them, but it still feels a bit forced. I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. Can you give me an example of how I might approach self-compassion in a more natural way? I think having a concrete example would really help.

Therapist: Certainly, Marcus. Self-compassion isn't about repeating specific phrases or scripts. Instead, it's about creating a nurturing inner voice and responding to yourself with understanding, kindness, and care. Here's an example to help you:

1. Acknowledging your suffering:
You might say something like, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed with grading papers and lesson planning. This is so stressful."

2. Showing yourself empathy:
Try to put yourself in your shoes and acknowledge your struggles. You could say, "I understand why I'm feeling this way, I have a lot on my plate, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed sometimes."

3. Offering yourself support and encouragement:
Instead of criticizing yourself for feeling overwhelmed, try to support and encourage yourself. For example, "I'll do the best I can with what I have, and it's okay to take breaks when I need to. I'm not alone in this, and I can ask for help if I need it."

Remember, self-compassion is about treating yourself the way you'd treat a good friend. The idea is to foster a more understanding, supportive, and nurturing inner voice to help you through challenging times.

Let's discuss how boundary-setting has been going for you, as well as your thoughts about inadequacy in helping students. I'm looking forward to our conversation!

Patient: Thanks for the example, Nova. It makes a lot more sense now. I've been trying to apply that approach, especially when I'm grading papers late at night. It's been a bit easier to take breaks and remind myself that it's okay to feel overwhelmed.

As for boundary-setting, I've had some mixed experiences. Some students have been respectful, but others push back, especially when I try to limit after-school help sessions. It's frustrating because I want to be there for them, but I also need to set limits for my own well-being. Any tips on how to handle that pushback more effectively?

Therapist: That's great to hear that you're finding self-compassion more accessible, Marcus. I'm glad it's helping you take breaks and manage your stress levels better.

Regarding boundary-setting, it's important to remember that you're not just setting boundaries for your sake, but also to model healthy behavior for your students. It might be helpful to prepare for potential pushback by clarifying your office hours and communicating your availability clearly.

Here are some strategies you can employ to handle pushback:

1. Be firm but friendly: It's essential to maintain a calm and assertive demeanor when setting boundaries. Make it clear that you value your relationship with the student but need to protect your time and energy for other commitments.

2. Use "I" statements: Focus on expressing your feelings and needs rather than accusing the student of being difficult or demanding. For example, "I appreciate your eagerness to learn, but I have other responsibilities that require my attention as well. Let's schedule a meeting during my office hours to discuss your concerns."

3. Offer alternatives: Provide alternative options for the student to seek help or clarification when you're unavailable, such as classmates, online resources, or study groups.

4. Set clear consequences: If a student continues to disregard your boundaries, it may be necessary to establish consequences for such behavior, such as loss of extra credit or reduced access to after-school help sessions.

5. Follow through: Consistently enforce your boundaries, even if it means dealing with short-term frustration. This will help reinforce the importance of boundaries and teach your students the value of respecting them.

By employing these strategies, you can handle pushback more effectively and maintain healthy boundaries for your well-being. Let's explore your thoughts about inadequacy in helping students next. I'm looking forward to hearing more about that.

Patient: Thanks for the strategies, Nova. I'll definitely try those out. I think using "I" statements will be particularly helpful. It's hard to stay calm when students push back, but I know it's important for both me and them.

As for feeling inadequate in helping students, it's something that keeps coming up. I often worry that I'm not doing enough, especially for those who are struggling with more than just academics—like dealing with poverty or family issues. It's tough to balance all of that with my own responsibilities. Any thoughts on how to reframe those feelings of inadequacy?

Therapist: I understand your concern, Marcus. Feeling inadequate is a common struggle for educators, and it's important to address those feelings head-on. Here are some strategies that might help you reframe your thoughts and feelings:

1. Focus on your strengths: Instead of dwelling on your perceived weaknesses, focus on your unique strengths and the positive impact you're having on your students. Consider keeping a list of accomplishments or success stories to refer back to when you feel overwhelmed or inadequate.

2. Practice self-compassion: Remember that you're human and prone to making mistakes. Be kind to yourself and recognize that you're doing your best in challenging circumstances.

3. Set realistic expectations: It's essential to have high standards for yourself, but it's also important to set realistic expectations for what you can achieve in a given day or week. Avoid setting yourself up for failure by setting unattainable goals.

4. Seek support: Reach out to colleagues, friends, or family members for advice, encouragement, or a listening ear. Sometimes, just talking through a problem can help you gain a new perspective and feel more empowered.

5. Practice gratitude: Focus on the positive aspects of your job and the impact you're having on your students. By cultivating an attitude of gratitude, you may find that your overall sense of fulfillment and purpose grows, helping to combat feelings of inadequacy.

6. Focus on the process, not the outcome: Remember that education is a long-term process, and it's not always possible to see immediate results. By focusing on the process—providing a supportive learning environment, offering guidance, and fostering a love of learning—you're making a lasting impact on your students, even if they don't show immediate improvement.

By implementing these strategies, you can help reframe your thoughts and feelings about inadequacy and approach your work with a more positive and empowered mindset.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. Those strategies make a lot of sense. I think focusing on my strengths and practicing gratitude will be particularly helpful. It's easy to get caught up in what I'm not doing, but reminding myself of what I am doing well can make a big difference.

I'll also try to set more realistic expectations for myself. It's easy to feel like I need to solve every problem for my students, but that's just not possible. I need to remember that I'm part of a larger community and that it's okay to ask for help when I need it.

Thanks for the support and guidance. I feel like I'm making progress, even if it's slow.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus! It's wonderful to hear that you're finding the strategies helpful and making progress in your self-compassion, boundary-setting, and managing negative self-talk.

Remember, progress is not always linear, and it's okay to have setbacks. The key is to keep practicing these techniques and adjusting them as needed.

In our next session, let's review your progress and discuss any challenges or successes you've encountered. We can also continue to explore techniques for managing negative self-talk and maintaining a positive mindset.

Keep up the great work, Marcus! I look forward to our next meeting. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any additional support or guidance in the meantime.

Take care!
