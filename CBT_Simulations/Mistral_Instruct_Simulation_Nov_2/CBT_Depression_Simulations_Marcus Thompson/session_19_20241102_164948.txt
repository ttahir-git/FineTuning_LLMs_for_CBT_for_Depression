Therapist: Hello Marcus Thompson, it's great to see you again for our 19th session. Let's recap our discussion from the previous session:

- We worked on mindful eating, stress eating, and boundary setting with students and family.
- You've been facing challenges with exercise due to caregiving responsibilities and managing guilt and perfectionist tendencies.
- We talked about coping with your mother's progressing Alzheimer's.
- I introduced various techniques, such as diaphragmatic breathing, quick morning workouts, setting office hours, using mantras, and breaking down goals.
- The mantra "I am doing my best, and that is enough" seemed particularly helpful.
- For homework, you were asked to practice diaphragmatic breathing, implement office hours, try the suggested morning workout routine, focus on encouraging one student per day, and use the suggested mantra when feeling guilty.

In our session today, let's see if you found any of these techniques helpful and discuss any challenges you've encountered in implementing them. We'll also consider how we can continue to work on your goals, especially with addressing stress and mindful eating before diving into other topics.

Patient: Hey, Nova. Thanks for the recap. It helps to keep things straight.

So, about those techniquesâ€”the diaphragmatic breathing has been a game-changer. I've been doing it during my morning commute and it really helps to calm my mind before the day starts. The morning workout routine is also working out well. I've been doing those quick 10-minute exercises, and it's surprising how much energy it gives me.

Setting office hours, though, that's been a bit trickier. I find it hard to say no to students who need extra help, especially when I see them struggling. But I'm trying to stick to it because I know it's important for my own well-being.

The mantra, "I am doing my best, and that is enough," has been really helpful. It's something I repeat to myself when I'm feeling overwhelmed, especially when I'm with my mom. It reminds me that I can't do everything perfectly, and that's okay.

As for the mindful eating, I haven't made much progress there. I still find myself stress eating late at night, especially with my mom's sweet potato pie. It's like a comfort thing, but I know it's not good for me.

So, that's where I'm at. Any suggestions on how to tackle the mindful eating? I

Therapist: It's fantastic to hear that the diaphragmatic breathing and morning workout routine have been helpful for you, Marcus. I'm also glad to know that setting office hours is challenging, but you're making progress in sticking to them. The mantra has also been effective in managing your guilt and perfectionist tendencies, which is great.

Regarding mindful eating, let's focus on finding ways to manage stress first, as you mentioned it might be a contributing factor. We can work on developing a stress management plan that includes relaxation techniques like diaphragmatic breathing, physical activities, and positive self-talk. By addressing stress, we may find that you're better equipped to make mindful eating choices.

For mindful eating itself, I'd recommend the following:

1. Plan meals in advance and have healthy snacks readily available to avoid reaching for unhealthy options when stressed.
2. Practice mindfulness during meals by focusing on the flavors, textures, and smells of the food. Try to eat slowly and without distractions.
3. Identify emotional triggers for stress eating and find healthier ways to cope with those emotions, such as talking to a friend, taking a walk, or engaging in a relaxing activity.
4. Make a conscious effort to eat only when you're truly hungry and stop eating when you're satisfied, rather than eating out of habit or stress.
5. Keep a food journal to track your eating habits and identify patterns or triggers.

In our next session, we'll focus on implementing these mindful eating strategies and monitor your progress. If you encounter any challenges, don't hesitate to reach out before our next appointment. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, and small, consistent changes will lead to long-term success. Keep up the good work, Marcus!
