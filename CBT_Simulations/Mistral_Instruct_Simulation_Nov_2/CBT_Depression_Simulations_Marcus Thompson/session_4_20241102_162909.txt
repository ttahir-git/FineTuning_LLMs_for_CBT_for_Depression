Session Number: 4

Patient: Hi, I'm Marcus Thompson. This is my 4 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session terminated due to error: RetryError[<Future at 0x71d97164b9d0 state=finished raised ValueError>]

Therapist: Hello Marcus Thompson, nice to see you again for our Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) session. I apologize for the technical issue in our last session. Let's focus on today's session. How have you been since our last meeting? Did you have the chance to practice the techniques we discussed? If so, how did that go?

Patient: Hey, Nova. It's good to be back. I've been alright, though still feeling the weight of everything. I did try some of the techniques we talked about last time, like the thought-stopping method when I found myself ruminating at night. It helped a bit, but I still catch myself slipping back into those negative loops. 

I also tried to use the breathing exercises you suggested when I felt overwhelmed during the day. That was actually pretty helpful in calming me down during some stressful moments at school. But I still have those nights where I just can't seem to turn off my mind, and I end up stress eating, especially my mom's sweet potato pie. It's a comfort, but it also brings guilt.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your experience, Marcus. It's important to acknowledge the progress you've made, even if it feels small. Continuing to practice the thought-stopping and breathing exercises shows your commitment to managing your mental health.

Regarding your nighttime struggles, it might be beneficial to explore additional techniques for improving your sleep. One possibility is developing a consistent sleep routine, which could involve going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, avoiding screens before bedtime, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.

As for managing stress eating, it could be helpful to examine the feelings and thoughts that arise when you turn to food for comfort. Identifying those triggers may help you find other coping strategies that better suit your needs. For example, engaging in a calming activity, such as journaling, reading, or taking a warm bath, could provide an alternative way to manage stress and reduce the urge to stress eat.

It's important to remember that progress in therapy can sometimes be slow, and setbacks are normal. The key is to continue practicing the skills you've learned and to maintain open communication about your experiences with me. Keep up the good work, and let's see how we can continue to work together to make positive changes in your life.

Is there anything specific you would like to focus on during our session today, Marcus?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the encouragement. I think a consistent sleep routine could really help. I've been trying to go to bed at the same time, but I haven't been strict about it. Maybe setting an alarm for the same time every morning could help reset my internal clock.

As for stress eating, I think you're right about identifying the triggers. It's usually when I'm feeling overwhelmed or guilty about something. I'll try to keep a journal to track those moments and see if I can find other ways to cope.

Today, I was thinking about focusing on how to better manage my time between work, caring for my mom, and spending quality time with my kids. It feels like there's never enough time in the day, and I end up feeling guilty about not doing enough for everyone. Do you have any suggestions on how to balance all these responsibilities better?

Therapist: Marcus, it's great that you're focusing on improving your time management skills. One technique I'd like to introduce is the Prioritization Matrix, also known as the Eisenhower Matrix. This tool helps you categorize tasks based on their urgency and importance, allowing you to focus on what truly matters.

1. **Do First (Important and Urgent):** These are tasks that require immediate attention and contribute to significant long-term goals. Examples could be a deadline at work, taking care of a sick family member, or scheduling a doctor's appointment for yourself.

2. **Schedule (Important but Not Urgent):** These are tasks that contribute to long-term goals but don't have an immediate deadline. Examples might be planning a family vacation, exercising regularly, or learning a new skill. Schedule these tasks in your calendar to ensure they get done.

3. **Delegate (Not Important but Urgent):** These are tasks that are urgent but don't significantly contribute to your long-term goals. Examples could be small errands or responding to emails that don't require your immediate attention. If possible, delegate these tasks to others or outsource them if necessary.

4. **Delete (Not Important and Not Urgent):** These are tasks that don't contribute to your long-term goals and aren't urgent. Examples might be unnecessary meetings, social media scrolling, or engaging in gossip. These tasks can often be eliminated or minimized to free up more time for what's truly important.

Using this matrix can help you prioritize your tasks effectively and ensure you're spending your time on what truly matters. You can even create a daily or weekly to-do list based on the Prioritization Matrix to keep yourself organized.

In addition to this, it might be helpful to set boundaries and communicate them with your family, coworkers, and friends. By setting clear expectations, you can create a schedule that works for everyone while still allowing you to take care of your own needs.

Does this approach seem helpful for managing your responsibilities, Marcus? And do you have any specific questions about the Prioritization Matrix or setting boundaries?

Session Summary:

Let me help you create a structured plan for managing your multiple responsibilities. First, could you walk me through what a typical day looks like for you? This will help us identify where we might find opportunities for better time management and self-care.

Also, I notice you mentioned feeling guilty about "not doing enough." Could you tell me more about what "doing enough" means to you? Sometimes our expectations of ourselves can be unrealistic, and it might be helpful to examine those beliefs.
Me: A typical day starts around 6:30 AM when I get up to help my mom with her morning routine and medications. Then I get the kids ready for school and drop them off by 8:00 AM. I work from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM at the office, usually eating lunch at my desk to keep up with deadlines. After work, I pick up the kids, help with homework, make dinner, and check on mom again. By the time everyone's settled, it's usually around 9:00 PM, and I'm exhausted.

As for "doing enough," I guess I feel like I should be more present with my kids when I'm with them, instead of being distracted by work emails or worried about mom. And with mom, I feel like I should be spending more quality time with her, not just managing her care. At work, I feel like I'm always playing catch-up. It's like I'm spread so thin that I'm not doing anything particularly well.
Therapist: Thank you for sharing such a detailed picture of your day, Marcus. It's clear you're carrying a lot of responsibilities, and it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let's break this down into manageable parts.

First, I notice there's very little time built in for self-care or breaks in your schedule. Running at full speed from 6:30 AM to 9:00 PM isn't sustainable, and it's important to acknowledge that.

Let's work on a few practical strategies:

1. Time Boundaries:
- Could you designate specific "no work email" times, especially during family time?
- Are there any tasks that could be delegated or shared with others?

2. Quality vs. Quantity:
- Instead of trying to do everything, could you focus on making certain moments more meaningful? For example, having 30 minutes of fully present time with your kids might be more valuable than two hours of distracted time.
- Similarly with your mom, could you schedule short but focused visits where you're not just managing care but actually connecting?

3. Priority Setting:
- What if we created a simple system to help you identify what truly needs your attention each day?
- This might help reduce the feeling of "playing catch-up" at work.

How do these suggestions sound? Which one would you like to explore further?

Also, I want to validate that feeling guilty doesn't mean you're not doing enough - it often means you care deeply about doing your best for everyone in your life. Would you be open to working on reframing some of these thoughts about "not doing enough"?
Me: Those suggestions make a lot of sense, especially about quality versus quantity of time. I never thought about it that way - that 30 minutes of focused attention might be better than hours of distracted time. I think I'd like to explore that more.

The idea of setting boundaries with work emails is scary but necessary. I'm always worried about missing something important, but you're right - it's affecting my family time. Maybe I could set specific times to check emails in the evening instead of being constantly available.

As for delegating tasks, I've been hesitant to ask for help. My sister offered to help with mom's care one evening a week, but I felt guilty accepting. I guess I need to get better at accepting help when it's offered.

And yes, I'd definitely like to work on reframing these thoughts about not doing enough. They're constantly nagging at me, making me feel like I'm failing everyone somehow.
Therapist: Your self-awareness and willingness to consider changes is really positive, Marcus. Let's develop a concrete plan to implement some of these changes.

1. For focused family time, let's start small:
- Choose a specific 30-minute block each day (maybe during dinner or homework time)
- Put your phone on "Do Not Disturb"
- Give your full attention to whatever activity you're doing with your kids

2. For work boundaries:
- Set two specific times to check emails in the evening (perhaps 7:00 PM and 8:30 PM)
- Communicate these boundaries to your colleagues
- Create an auto-reply for urgent matters

3. Accepting help:
- Accept your sister's offer for one evening a week
- Use this time for either self-care or focused time with your kids
- Remember: accepting help makes you a better caregiver, not a worse one

For reframing thoughts about "not doing enough," let's try this exercise:
When you have that thought, ask yourself:
- "Would I judge another person in my situation this harshly?"
- "What would I say to a friend juggling all these responsibilities?"

Would you like to commit to trying any of these strategies this week? We can start with just one if that feels more manageable.
Me: Yes, I think I'd like to start with the focused family time. Dinner seems like a good opportunity for that - we're all together anyway, and I can make it a rule to keep my phone in another room during that time. Maybe we could even take turns sharing the best and worst parts of our day, something to make it more meaningful.

And you know what? I'm going to take my sister up on her offer. You're right - it doesn't make me a worse caregiver to accept help. Maybe I can use that evening to do something with the kids, like helping with a school project or just playing games together.

The reframing exercise is interesting too. I know I wouldn't judge anyone else as harshly as I judge myself. I guess I need to work on extending the same kindness to myself that I would to others.

Can we make this our homework for the week? To try these specific changes and maybe keep track of how they affect both my stress levels and the quality of my interactions with family?
Therapist: Absolutely! That's an excellent plan, Marcus. Let's outline your specific homework for this week:

1. Focused Family Dinner Time:
- Keep phone in another room during dinner
- Implement the "best and worst part of the day" sharing routine
- Try this for at least 5 days this week

2. Accept Sister's Help:
- Contact your sister to arrange one evening this week
- Plan a specific activity with your kids for that time
- Notice and write down how you feel before and after accepting this help

3. Thought Reframing Exercise:
- Keep a small journal or use your phone to note when you have "not doing enough" thoughts
- Practice asking yourself the two questions we discussed
- Write down what you would say to a friend in the same situation

Would you also like to track your stress levels on a scale of 1-10 each day? This could help us see patterns and measure the impact of these changes.

Remember, the goal isn't perfection - it's progress. How does this homework plan sound to you?
Me: That sounds like a really manageable plan. I like the idea of tracking stress levels too - it would be helpful to see if there are any patterns or if these changes actually make a difference. I can use the notes app on my phone to keep track since I always have it with me.

I'm actually feeling a bit more optimistic now that we have a concrete plan. It's still overwhelming when I think about everything I need to juggle, but breaking it down into these specific actions makes it feel more doable.

One question though - what should I do if I slip up? Like if I end up checking work emails during dinner one night or if I start feeling really guilty about my sister helping with mom? I don't want to fall back into old patterns just because I make one mistake.
Therapist: That's an excellent question, Marcus, and it shows you're thinking ahead realistically. Remember, setbacks are a normal part of any change process. Here's how to handle them:

1. If you slip up:
- Acknowledge it without harsh self-judgment
- Treat it as a learning opportunity rather than a failure
- Simply return to the plan at the next opportunity
- Note what triggered the slip-up in your tracking

2. For specific situations:
- If you check emails during dinner: Just put the phone away and continue with family time
- If guilt arises about your sister helping: Practice the reframing exercise we discussed
- Write down: "This help allows me to be a better father and son"

Think of it like learning to ride a bike - wobbling or falling occasionally doesn't mean you've failed; it's part of learning. Would it help to add a section in your tracking for "lessons learned" from any setbacks?

Remember: Progress isn't linear. The goal is gradual improvement, not perfection. How does this approach to handling setbacks feel to you?
Me: That's really helpful, especially the bike-riding analogy. I like the idea of adding a "lessons learned" section to my tracking - it turns the setbacks into something constructive rather than just failures. And you're right, treating them as learning opportunities feels much better than beating myself up about them.

I think I can handle this approach. It feels more realistic than expecting perfect execution right away. And knowing that wobbles are normal makes me feel less anxious about trying these changes.

I'm going to start tonight with the phone-free dinner and reaching out to my sister. Maybe we can review how it all went in our next session? I'd like to share what worked and what challenges came up.
Therapist: That's a great plan, Marcus! Yes, we'll definitely review your experiences in our next session. Your positive attitude and willingness to embrace this approach is really encouraging. Starting tonight with the phone-free dinner and reaching out to your sister are excellent first steps.

Before we wrap up today's session, let me summarize your action items:
1. Start phone-free family dinners with sharing time
2. Contact sister to arrange help one evening
3. Track daily stress levels (1-10)
4. Keep notes on:
   - Successes
   - Setbacks and lessons learned
   - Thought reframing exercises

Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify before we end today's session?
Me: No, I think I'm clear on everything. Thank you for helping me break this down into manageable steps and for showing me how to handle setbacks more constructively. I'm feeling more hopeful about making these changes work.

I'll see you next week with my tracking notes and experiences. Thanks again, Nova.
Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. I'm really impressed with your commitment to making these positive changes. Remember to be patient and kind with yourself as you implement these new strategies. Looking forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Take care!
