Therapist: Marcus Thompson, it's great to see you again! Let's dive right into our session today.

First, I'd like to acknowledge the progress you've made with techniques like diaphragmatic breathing, morning workouts, and your mantra for managing perfectionist tendencies. It's inspiring to see your dedication to making improvements in your life.

Regarding the challenges you've identified, I'd like to offer some guidance. For boundary-setting with students, it might be helpful to set clear expectations upfront and follow through with consequences when they are not met. You might also consider using a consistent schedule for office hours and communicating that schedule clearly.

As for emotional eating, it's understandable that comfort food can be difficult to resist. One strategy to consider is mindful eating â€“ taking the time to savor and pay attention to your food, rather than quickly consuming it as a way to cope with emotions. Another technique could be distraction, such as going for a walk or calling a friend when the urge to stress eat arises.

Lastly, I'd like to address the issue of your mother's sweet potato pie. It might help to find a healthier alternative to this comfort food that still satisfies your craving. You could also try practicing mindfulness around the pie, such as taking a moment to appreciate its flavor and texture before eating it, rather than consuming it mindlessly.

Remember, it's okay to have setbacks and to continue working on these challenges. It's all part of the process. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing you next week!

Take care,

AI CBT Therapist.
