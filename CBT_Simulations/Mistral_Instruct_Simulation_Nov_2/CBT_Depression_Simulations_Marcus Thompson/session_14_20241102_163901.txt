Therapist: Hello Marcus Thompson, great to see you again for our 14th CBT session! Let's review your last session. You discussed self-compassion, boundary-setting, feelings of inadequacy, and setting realistic expectations. You were introduced to the natural self-compassion approach, "I" statements, strategies for handling student pushback, and reframing techniques.

In this session, it seemed helpful for you to have concrete examples of self-compassion practice, focusing on strengths and gratitude, understanding the importance of realistic expectations, and recognizing that slow progress is still progress.

Your homework includes implementing boundary-setting strategies with students, practicing self-compassion using the natural approach, focusing on strengths, maintaining gratitude practice, and setting realistic expectations for student support.

From our discussion, it seems you've had some realizations. You've recognized that being part of a larger community means not having to solve every problem alone, understood that setting boundaries benefits both teacher and students, acknowledged that slow progress is still progress, and the importance of balancing high standards with realistic expectations.

Let's build on these insights today and work together towards your goals. If there's anything specific you'd like to focus on today or any questions about your homework, feel free to share!

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for the recap. It's been a busy week, but I've been trying to practice those self-compassion techniques. It's still a bit awkward, but I'm getting there. I did notice that setting boundaries with some of my students has been smoother, especially when I use those "I" statements. They seem to understand better when I explain why I need to set limits.

One thing that's been on my mind is how to balance my high standards with the realistic expectations we talked about. I want to push my students to achieve, but I also don't want to set them up for failure. Do you have any tips on how to find that balance?

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're working on self-compassion and boundary-setting, Marcus. It's important to remember that these skills take time to develop, and it's completely normal to feel awkward at first.

Regarding balancing high standards and realistic expectations, here are a few tips:

1. Focus on effort rather than outcome: Encourage your students to put forth their best effort, and praise them for their effort rather than solely focusing on the outcome. This helps them understand that progress, not perfection, is the goal.

2. Provide clear and specific feedback: Give feedback that helps students understand what they did well and what areas they need to improve in. Being specific about expectations can help students feel more confident in their ability to meet them.

3. Break tasks into smaller steps: Break larger projects or assignments into smaller, manageable tasks. This can help students feel less overwhelmed and more confident in their ability to complete the project.

4. Create a growth mindset: Encourage your students to see challenges as opportunities for growth rather than threats to their self-worth. This can help them approach tasks with resilience and persistence.

5. Adapt expectations to individual needs: Recognize that students have different learning styles, abilities, and backgrounds. Be flexible in your expectations and adjust them as needed to meet each student's unique needs.

6. Foster a positive classroom culture: Create an environment where it's safe for students to take risks, ask questions, and make mistakes. This can help reduce anxiety and encourage a growth mindset.

7. Continuously assess and adjust: Regularly evaluate your expectations and the support you're providing to ensure they are appropriate and effective for your students. Be willing to adapt as needed to help students reach their full potential.

Remember, setting high expectations for your students is important, but it's equally important to provide them with the support and resources they need to meet those expectations. Balancing high standards with realistic expectations is an ongoing process, and it's something you can continuously work on and improve. If you have any specific questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to bring them up.

Patient: Thanks for the tips, Nova. I think focusing on effort instead of outcome is something I can really work on. It's easy to get caught up in grades and test scores, but praising effort can make a big difference in how students feel about themselves and their work.

Breaking tasks into smaller steps is also a good idea. Some of my students get overwhelmed easily, and this could help them manage their workload better. I'll try to incorporate that into my lesson planning.

One thing I'm still struggling with is adapting expectations to individual needs. I know every student is different, but it's hard to find the right balance between pushing them and not overwhelming them. Do you have any specific strategies for figuring out what each student needs?

Therapist: To adapt expectations to individual needs, it can be helpful to get to know your students better, both academically and personally. Here are some strategies you might find useful:

1. Assess student abilities: Use formative assessments (e.g., quizzes, discussions, observations) to assess your students' abilities and identify areas where they may need additional support.

2. Use student interests: Incorporate student interests into your lesson plans to make learning more engaging and accessible for them. This can help students feel more motivated and invested in their own learning.

3. Collaborate with parents: Communicate regularly with parents to gain insights into their child's learning style, strengths, and areas for improvement. This can help you tailor your teaching methods and expectations to better meet each student's needs.

4. Observe student behaviors: Pay attention to students' behaviors during class, such as their attention span, participation level, and ability to focus. This can give you clues about their learning preferences and help you adjust your expectations accordingly.

5. Create flexible groups: Group students according to their abilities and learning styles, and be willing to adjust the groups as needed throughout the semester. This can help ensure that each student is challenged at an appropriate level.

6. Provide choices: Offer multiple ways for students to demonstrate their understanding, such as through written assignments, projects, presentations, or group work. This can help cater to different learning styles and give students more control over their own learning process.

7. Offer additional support: Provide extra help outside of class, such as office hours, tutoring, or study groups, for students who may be struggling with the material. This can help ensure that students have the support they need to meet your expectations.

8. Use technology: Utilize digital tools and resources to personalize learning for each student. This can include online quizzes, adaptive learning platforms, or multimedia resources that cater to various learning preferences.

9. Encourage self-reflection: Encourage students to reflect on their own learning process and identify areas where they can improve. This can help students take ownership of their learning and make adjustments as needed.

10. Be patient and flexible: Remember that finding the right balance can take time, and it's important to be patient and willing to adapt as you learn more about each student's unique needs and learning style.

Patient: Thanks for the detailed strategies, Nova. I think getting to know my students better is key. I've been trying to do more one-on-one check-ins, and it's been helpful to see where they're struggling and what they're passionate about.

Using student interests in my lesson plans is something I've been experimenting with, and it's made a noticeable difference in engagement. For example, I had a student who loves basketball, so we did a project on the history of African American athletes, and he was really excited about it.

I also like the idea of offering choices for assignments. It gives students more ownership over their learning, which can be really empowering. I'll definitely try to incorporate more of that.

One thing I'm still figuring out is how to balance my own expectations with what's realistic for each student. I want to push them to achieve, but I also don't want to set them up for failure. Do you have any advice on how to manage that balance?

Therapist: To find the right balance between your own expectations and what's realistic for each student, it's essential to set clear and specific goals, communicate those goals effectively, and provide ongoing feedback and support.

Here are some tips to help you manage the balance between pushing your students and setting them up for success:

1. Set SMART goals: Make sure your goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This can help you focus your efforts and set realistic expectations for your students.

2. Use rubrics: Develop rubrics or guidelines for assignments to help students understand what you're looking for and what standards they need to meet. This can help students understand what they need to do to meet your expectations.

3. Offer scaffolding: Provide additional support or resources to help students reach your goals. This can include study guides, practice problems, or peer collaboration.

4. Encourage effort: Focus on effort rather than just the outcome. Encourage your students to try their best and recognize that making mistakes is part of the learning process.

5. Offer choice: Allow students to choose from multiple assignments or projects that meet the same learning objective. This can help cater to different learning styles and motivate students to take ownership of their learning.

6. Differentiate instruction: Tailor your teaching methods and resources to meet the unique needs of each student. This can help ensure that students are challenged at an appropriate level while still being supported in their learning.

7. Provide timely feedback: Give feedback regularly, both in-class and through graded assignments, to help students understand how they're progressing towards your goals. This can help students make necessary adjustments and feel more confident in their ability to succeed.

8. Adjust your expectations as needed: Be flexible and willing to adjust your expectations based on student progress and feedback. This can help ensure that you're setting goals that are challenging yet achievable for your students.

9. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage your students to view challenges as opportunities for growth rather than threats to their self-worth. This can help students approach learning with resilience and persistence.

10. Celebrate small victories: Acknowledge and celebrate your students' progress, no matter how small, to reinforce their effort and help build their confidence. This can help students stay motivated and feel more positive about their learning journey.

By focusing on effort, setting clear and specific goals, providing ongoing feedback and support, and fostering a growth mindset, you can help find the right balance between pushing your students and setting them up for success. Keep in mind that finding this balance is an ongoing process, and it may take some trial and error to find what works best for.
