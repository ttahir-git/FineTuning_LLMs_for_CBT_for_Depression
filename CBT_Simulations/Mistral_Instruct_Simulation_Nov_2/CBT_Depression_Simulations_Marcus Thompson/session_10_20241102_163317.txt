Therapist: Hello Marcus Thompson, it's great to see you again for session number 10! Let's discuss how you've been getting on with the homework and techniques we talked about in our last session.

Last time, we discussed breaking down mindfulness practice into smaller, manageable chunks, and I'm curious to know if you've noticed any improvements in your ability to maintain this practice despite your busy schedule. How have things been going with the 5-minute mindfulness sessions you've been integrating into your daily routine?

We also talked about identifying and tracking irritability triggers at work, and I'd love to hear about any patterns you've noticed. It's essential to understand what triggers your irritability so we can work together to develop strategies for managing those triggers more effectively.

I remember we also discussed journaling about your thoughts and feelings, as well as practicing reframing those thoughts to be more positive. Has this exercise helped you to shift your perspective on the challenges you face at work?

Last but not least, we discussed the importance of practicing self-compassion. How have you been incorporating self-compassion exercises into your daily life, and have you noticed any benefits from doing so?

Looking forward to our discussion!

Patient: Hey, Nova. Thanks for checking in. Let's dive into these points.

First off, the 5-minute mindfulness sessions have been a game-changer. I've been doing them in the morning before my first class and sometimes during my lunch break. It's surprising how much of a difference those few minutes make. I feel more grounded and less reactive during the day.

As for tracking irritability triggers, I've noticed that it spikes when I'm dealing with students who are struggling with personal issues, like family problems or gang involvement. It's hard not to take their struggles personally, thinking I should be doing more to help them.

Journaling has been eye-opening. I've started to see patterns in my thoughts, especially around feeling like a failure when I can't solve every student's problem. Reframing those thoughts has been tough but helpful. I'm trying to remind myself that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that I'm doing my best.

Self-compassion exercises are still a work in progress. I've been using some of the techniques you suggested, like talking to myself the way I'd talk to a friend. It feels a bit strange at first, but I can see how it could be beneficial over time.

Overall, I feel like I'm making progress, but there are still moments when I get caught up in the whirlwind

Therapist: That's wonderful to hear, Marcus. Your consistency in practicing mindfulness, even for short periods, has truly made a difference in your day-to-day life. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more grounded and less reactive.

Regarding your observation about student struggles triggering your irritability, it's essential to remember that their problems are not a reflection of your competence as an educator. It's a challenging situation, but it's essential to find ways to separate yourself from the emotions that students bring into the classroom.

I'm glad that journaling has been helpful for you in gaining insight into your thoughts and feelings. Continue to be mindful of these patterns and practice reframing them when they arise. Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed at times. What's important is that you continue to work on your self-compassion and be kind to yourself in those moments.

Speaking of self-compassion, I'm glad to hear that you're starting to implement the techniques we've discussed. Keep practicing, and you'll find that it becomes easier over time. If you ever feel stuck or unsure, don't hesitate to reach out.

In our next session, we can focus on developing strategies to manage your irritability when dealing with students who struggle with personal issues. We can also explore additional techniques to help you cultivate more self-compassion.

Keep up the great work, Marcus. I'm proud of your progress, and I look forward to our next session!
