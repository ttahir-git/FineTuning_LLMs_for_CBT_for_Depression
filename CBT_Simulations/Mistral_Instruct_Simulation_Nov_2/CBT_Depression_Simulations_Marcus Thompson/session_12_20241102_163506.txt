Therapist: Hello Marcus Thompson, it's great to see you for Session #12! Let's start by reviewing your progress and discussing any challenges you might have encountered since our last meeting.

Based on your summary, it seems that you've made good progress with your self-compassion practice, even though it still feels a bit awkward. This is completely normal as we often find it difficult to show compassion to ourselves. However, remember that self-compassion is an essential tool to help you navigate challenging times and reduce stress. Keep practicing and be patient with yourself.

Regarding setting emotional boundaries with students, it's great that you're becoming more aware of the importance of maintaining a healthy balance in your interactions. Remember, it's okay to set boundaries to protect your own wellbeing while still providing support to your students. I encourage you to continue reflecting on boundary-setting challenges and developing strategies to address them.

The ongoing mindfulness and journaling practices seem to be helpful in increasing your self-awareness and identifying negative self-talk patterns. Continue with these practices as they will help you further understand and challenge your thoughts, leading to a more positive mindset.

Lastly, the thought reframing exercises we've worked on are aimed at helping you change your negative thought patterns into more positive and constructive ones. As you've identified patterns in your negative self-talk, particularly around feeling inadequate in helping students, let's focus on reframing these thoughts during our sessions and through the exercises we'll assign as homework.

For this session, I'd like to suggest the following homework:
1. Continue mindfulness and journaling practice
2. Practice scheduled self-compassion exercises
3. Set and communicate clear office hours
4. Identify a specific negative self-talk pattern and develop a thought-reframing strategy for it
5. Reflect on boundary-setting challenges and develop strategies to address them

Remember that progress takes time and patience. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

Patient: Hey, Nova. Thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to be back.

Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to the self-compassion practice, but it still feels a bit forced. I catch myself thinking, "Why am I doing this for myself? Shouldn't I be focusing on others?" It's like I'm not used to putting myself first, even for a few minutes.

Setting boundaries with my students has been a mixed bag. Some of them are really pushing back, especially the ones who are used to me being available all the time. I had to have a tough conversation with a few, explaining that I need to take care of myself too. It was hard, but I think it was necessary.

Mindfulness and journaling have been a bit easier to maintain. I've noticed that my negative self-talk is often about feeling like I'm not doing enough for my students, especially the ones who are struggling the most. It's like I'm constantly questioning whether I'm making a real difference.

For the homework, I'll keep up with the mindfulness and journaling, and I'll try to be more consistent with the self-compassion exercises. I'll also work on setting clearer office hours and communicating them better to my students.

As for the thought-reframing, I'll focus on that negative self-talk

Therapist: Marcus, I appreciate your honesty and openness about the challenges you're facing. It's important to remember that self-compassion takes practice and time to become second nature, especially when it feels forced or uncomfortable. Here are some strategies you might find helpful:

1. Practice self-compassion daily and try to incorporate it into your routine, like right after a difficult day or before bed.
2. Reframe the thought "Why am I doing this for myself?" to "I deserve to take care of myself so I can better serve others."
3. Focus on the benefits of self-compassion for both you and your students. You'll be more energized, focused, and effective in your role when you're taking care of yourself.

Regarding setting boundaries, it's essential to be firm yet compassionate when communicating them to your students. Remember that setting boundaries doesn't mean being unavailable or uncaring, but rather ensuring you have the time and resources to provide quality support to all students.

For the thought-reframing exercise, I recommend focusing on the self-talk pattern "I'm not doing enough for my students." Try to challenge this thought by:

1. Recognizing that you are doing your best and that you cannot control the outcomes for every student.
2. Reframing the thought by focusing on the progress your students are making, no matter how small.
3. Practicing gratitude for the positive impact you've had on your students and the opportunities you have to make a difference.

Remember to be patient with yourself as you work through these challenges. Change takes time, and it's important to celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Keep up the good work, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!
