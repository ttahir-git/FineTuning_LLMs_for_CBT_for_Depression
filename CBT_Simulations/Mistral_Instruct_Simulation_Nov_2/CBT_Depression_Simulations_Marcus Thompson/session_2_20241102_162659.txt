Therapist: Hello Marcus Thompson, it's great to see you again! Last session we discussed a variety of topics related to the sources of your stress, such as your teaching responsibilities, caring for a mother with Alzheimer's, and co-parenting challenges. We also talked about how these stressors might lead to feelings of inadequacy and guilt across different life roles.

Remember, we identified that one of your current coping mechanisms is exercise, and we discussed how effective it can be. We also discussed how you might be prone to certain cognitive distortions, like all-or-nothing thinking and overgeneralization, which can exacerbate your emotional distress.

In this session, we can continue to work on identifying and challenging these cognitive distortions, and build upon your current coping strategies. Additionally, we will explore self-compassion practices to help manage difficult emotions.

As we move forward, it's important to remember that the problems you're facing are real, but your perspective and approach can be adjusted. I encourage you to continue practicing awareness of your thoughts and emotions between sessions, as this will help us make progress during our sessions together.

This week, I would like you to take a few minutes each day to journal about your thoughts and emotions, and pay particular attention to any instances of cognitive distortions. Bring your journal to our next session, and we can use it to further explore your thought patterns and develop coping strategies.

Looking forward to our next session! If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don't hesitate to reach out.
