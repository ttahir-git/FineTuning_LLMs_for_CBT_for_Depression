Therapist: Hello Marcus Thompson, it's great to see you again! I see we had a productive session last time where we discussed managing stress related to your mother's Alzheimer's, balancing responsibilities, and developing effective coping strategies.

It sounds like you've taken some steps to implement the techniques and exercises we discussed, such as task prioritization, setting boundaries, and incorporating self-care activities into your daily routine. That's fantastic! Remember, these changes might feel challenging at first, but they're crucial for maintaining your mental wellbeing.

I encourage you to continue prioritizing your responsibilities and delegating tasks where possible. You've acknowledged that trying to do everything at once isn't sustainable, and this is a crucial insight.

Also, keep exploring support groups for caregivers. Connecting with others in similar situations can provide invaluable support and understanding.

Let's continue to work together to find a balanced approach that works for you. Remember, even small, manageable changes can make a significant difference in managing stress and maintaining your wellbeing.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to bring them up during our next session. Until then, take care of yourself and continue practicing the techniques we've discussed.

Looking forward to our next session!
