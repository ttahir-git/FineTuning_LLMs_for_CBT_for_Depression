Session Number: 1

Patient: Hi, I'm Marcus Thompson. This is my first CBT session. I'm here because I've been feeling down lately.

Therapist: Hello, Marcus Thompson. It's nice to meet you. I'm here to help you with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of psychotherapy that helps people understand and change thought patterns that lead to harmful emotions and behaviors.

Let's start by discussing what's been bothering you lately. Can you tell me more about what you mean when you say you've been feeling down? Have you noticed any specific thoughts, feelings, or situations that seem to contribute to this feeling?

We'll work together to identify these patterns and develop strategies to change them, so you can feel better and improve your quality of life.

Patient: Thanks for the explanation about CBT. I appreciate that. Lately, I've been feeling down a lot, especially when I'm at home or trying to plan lessons for my students. I keep thinking about how I'm not doing enough for them, especially with all the issues they face—poverty, gang violence, lack of resources. It feels overwhelming.

At night, I lie awake thinking about my mom with Alzheimer's and how I'm not there for her as much as I should be. And then there's the stress of co-parenting with my ex-wife, Sarah. I feel guilty about not being able to give my kids, Jamal and Aisha, the time and attention they need. It's like I'm failing everyone, and it's eating me up inside.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load, Marcus, and that this weight is causing you to feel overwhelmed and down. It's important to acknowledge and validate these feelings, but also to recognize that we can work together to address them through CBT.

One of the core concepts of CBT is identifying and challenging negative thoughts, or cognitive distortions. In your case, it seems like you're engaging in all-or-nothing thinking ("I'm not doing enough"), overgeneralization ("I'm failing everyone"), and catastrophizing ("it's eating me up inside").

As we work together, we'll practice recognizing these thought patterns, examining their validity, and replacing them with more balanced and helpful thoughts. This can help you feel better about yourself and the situation you're in, and give you the energy and motivation to take action towards positive change.

In the meantime, I want to encourage you to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to not be perfect, especially given the challenges you're facing. Try to identify areas where you are doing well, and focus on taking small steps towards improvement rather than trying to achieve perfection.

We'll also work on setting realistic expectations for yourself, and developing strategies to manage stress, such as mindfulness, exercise, and seeking social support from friends and family.

Does this approach make sense, and are you open to working together to tackle these challenges using CBT techniques?

Patient: Yeah, that makes sense. I get what you're saying about all-or-nothing thinking and overgeneralization. It's like I'm always looking at the worst-case scenario and not seeing the good things I do. For example, I know I'm a good teacher and that I've helped a lot of students over the years, but I just can't shake this feeling that it's not enough.

I'm willing to try these CBT techniques, but I guess I'm a bit skeptical about how much they can really help. I mean, the problems I'm dealing with are pretty big—systemic issues, family responsibilities, and all that. But I'm open to giving it a shot. If it can help me manage my stress and feel a bit better, then it's worth it.

One thing I do try to do is exercise—I run along Lake Michigan and play basketball with the community league. It helps me clear my head a bit, but it doesn't always last. Maybe there's something more I can do with that?

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're open to using CBT to help manage your feelings and stress. And it's great that you already incorporate exercise into your routine, as physical activity can be very beneficial for mental health.

To further enhance the benefits of exercise, we can explore ways to combine it with mindfulness techniques, such as focusing on your breath and the sensations in your body during your runs or basketball games. This can help you stay present and reduce the impact of negative thoughts that may arise.

Additionally, we can discuss setting specific, achievable goals related to exercise, like increasing the frequency or duration of your workouts, or trying a new activity, like yoga or swimming. Achieving these goals can boost your self-efficacy and confidence, which can further improve your overall mood and well-being.

Remember, the goal of CBT is not to completely eliminate negative thoughts or emotions, but rather to help you manage them more effectively. With time and practice, you'll be better equipped to recognize and challenge negative thought patterns and replace them with more balanced, helpful thoughts.

It's also important to remember that systemic issues and challenges with family and work can be difficult to overcome, but they are not insurmountable. By focusing on the things within your control, such as your own thoughts, emotions, and actions, you can take steps towards creating positive change in your life.

As we continue our sessions, we'll explore other CBT techniques to help you manage stress, improve your self-esteem, and find more balance in your life. I'm here to support you on this journey, so don't hesitate to share your thoughts and feelings with me.

Let's make a plan for the next session, and in the meantime, I encourage you to practice the techniques we've discussed, such as self-compassion, setting realistic expectations, and mindful exercise. If you need any additional support or resources in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out.
