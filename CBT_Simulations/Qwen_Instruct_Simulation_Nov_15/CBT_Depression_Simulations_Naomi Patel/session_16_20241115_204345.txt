Therapist: : Hi Naomi, it's great to see you again. Thank you for summarizing your last session so thoroughly. Let's dive into our session today and see how we can build on the strategies we discussed previously. 

Firstly, how have you been implementing the new techniques and strategies since our last session? Have you found any particular ones to be more helpful or challenging? Also, have you noticed any changes or new insights since we last met?

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to see you too. 

Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to the new techniques, especially the structured time management with regular breaks. I set up a timer on my phone to remind me to take a 5-minute break every hour while studying. It's been surprisingly helpful. I feel less burnt out and more focused when I return to my work.

The gratitude practice with phone reminders has been a bit hit or miss. Sometimes I forget to do it, but when I do, it does lift my mood a bit. I think I need to make it more of a habit.

The visualization during guided relaxation has been interesting. I find it easier to relax when I imagine a peaceful place, like a beach in Gujarat. It helps me unwind after a stressful day.

One new insight I've had is that I tend to avoid group projects because they trigger a lot of anxiety. I realized this when I had to work on one last week. I ended up feeling overwhelmed and had to take a step back. I think I need to work on managing that anxiety better.

Therapist: : Hi Naomi, it's good to hear that you've been implementing the new techniques and strategies. Let's focus on what you've found helpful and areas where you might need some additional support.

It's great that you've been sticking to the structured time management and regular breaks. This has been a key part of enhancing your focus and reducing burnout. How about setting some specific goals for managing your breaks? For example, what activities do you plan to do during these breaks? Perhaps you could explore some quick stretching exercises, a brief walk, or even a short meditation.

Regarding the gratitude practice, it's normal for habits to be inconsistent at first. One way to increase the likelihood of sticking to it is to start with a manageable frequency. For instance, try to do it every day for the first week, and then gradually decrease it if needed. This can help build the habit over time. You might also find it helpful to use a specific app or a gratitude journal to make it more consistent.

On the visualization technique, it's wonderful that you're finding it beneficial. Visualization can be a powerful tool for relaxation. You might consider experimenting with different scenarios or adding sounds or smells to make the visualization more vivid and immersive. For example, you could imagine the sound of waves or the smell of saltwater to enhance your beach scene.

Regarding your anxiety around group projects, this is a common issue. It might help to break down the project into smaller, more manageable tasks. Set specific deadlines for each task and celebrate small milestones. Additionally, consider discussing your feelings with your group members. Sometimes, just sharing your concerns can alleviate some of the anxiety. If needed, you could also talk to the instructor about your struggles and see if they can offer any support or alternative approaches.

Lastly, let's review and update your action plan for the next two weeks. We can add specific tasks and goals for the strategies you've been practicing, and we can also plan some additional activities to help you manage your anxiety during group projects. What do you think would be helpful for you to add or adjust in your plan?

Looking forward to hearing from you and continuing to support you in your journey.

Patient: Thanks for the suggestions, Nova. 

For the structured breaks, I think adding some quick stretching exercises sounds like a good idea. I often feel stiff after sitting for long periods. Maybe I could also take a short walk around the campus during these breaks. It would help me clear my head and get some fresh air.

For the gratitude practice, I'll try using a gratitude journal. I think writing things down might make it more tangible and easier to remember. I'll aim to do it every day for the first week and see how it goes.

Regarding the visualization, I like the idea of adding sounds and smells. I could use a nature sounds app to play the sound of waves while I visualize the beach. Maybe I could also use a scented candle that smells like the ocean. It would make the experience more immersive.

For the group projects, breaking them down into smaller tasks is a great idea. I'll try setting specific deadlines for each task and celebrate small milestones. I'll also consider talking to my group members about my anxiety. It might help to share my concerns and see if we can work together more effectively.

For my action plan, I think adding specific tasks for each strategy would be helpful. Here's what I propose:

1. **Structured Breaks:**
   - Set up a timer for hourly breaks.
   - During breaks, do quick stretching exercises and take a short walk around campus

Therapist: : That sounds like a great plan, Naomi. It's wonderful that you're being so proactive and detailed in your action plan. Let's refine and expand on it to ensure you have all the support you need.

### Updated Action Plan for the Next Two Weeks

1. **Structured Breaks:**
   - Set up a timer for hourly breaks.
   - During breaks, do quick stretching exercises (e.g., shoulder rolls, neck stretches, and standing lunges).
   - Take a short walk around campus.
   - Spend 2-3 minutes doing progressive muscle relaxation.

2. **Gratitude Practice:**
   - Aim to write in your gratitude journal every day for the first week.
   - Reflect on three things you are grateful for each day.
   - Use your phone reminders to stay consistent.

3. **Visualization During Guided Relaxation:**
   - Use a nature sounds app to enhance your beach visualization.
   - Use a scented candle (e.g., ocean scent) to help immerse yourself.
   - Practice this technique once a day for 5-10 minutes.

4. **Combining Relaxation Techniques:**
   - Continue using 5-point breathing as a mindful moment during breaks.
   - Combine 5-point breathing with progressive muscle relaxation during your daily guided relaxation practice.

5. **Time Management for Group Projects:**
   - Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
   - Set specific deadlines for each task.
   - Celebrate small milestones (e.g., completing a section of the project).
   - Share your anxiety with your group members and discuss how you can work together more effectively.

6. **Connecting with the LGBTQ+ Community:**
   - Reach out to local or online support groups for academic and emotional support.
   - Attend an LGBTQ+ meet-up or workshop if possible.

7. **Self-Care Activities:**
   - Schedule regular self-care activities such as reading, listening to music, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy.
   - Make these activities a part of your weekly routine.

### Additional Suggestions

- **Mindful Moments:** Consider incorporating brief mindful moments throughout the day, such as 1-minute pauses to focus on your breath and current moment.
- **Progress Tracking:** Use a digital tool or a simple notebook to track your progress on these tasks. This can help you stay accountable and see your progress over time.
- **Review and Adjust:** Plan to review your progress in our next session in two weeks. Be open to adjusting your plan if something isn't working as well as expected.

Let's meet in two weeks to review how these strategies are working for you. In the meantime, if you encounter any challenges or have new insights, don't hesitate to reach out. Your progress is important, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Take care, Naomi, and have a productive week ahead.
