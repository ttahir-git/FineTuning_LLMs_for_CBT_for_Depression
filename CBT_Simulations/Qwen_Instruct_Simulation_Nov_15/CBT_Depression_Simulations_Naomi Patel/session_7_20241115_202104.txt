Therapist: : Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again. I hope you're doing well. Let's pick up where we left off. During our last session, we talked about how you were feeling overwhelmed with your academic workload and the pressure from your advisor. We also discussed the challenges in maintaining mindfulness and journaling practices, and how skipping these practices seems to increase your anxiety levels. How have these issues been affecting you since our last session? Any new developments or changes you'd like to share?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for asking. I've been trying to keep up with my mindfulness and journaling, but it's been tough. The pressure from my advisor has been ramping up, especially with a big project deadline coming up next week. I've been pulling all-nighters, and that's made it really hard to stick to my routines. I skipped journaling for a few days, and I could feel my anxiety creeping back in. It's like I'm in a vicious cycle—the more stressed I get, the less I take care of myself, and then I get even more stressed. It's exhausting.

Therapist: Hi Naomi, thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you’re really feeling the pressure, especially with the upcoming deadline from your advisor. It’s common to fall into that vicious cycle where stress leads to neglecting self-care, which then exacerbates the stress. Let’s work together to break this cycle and find some strategies that might help.

First, let’s explore some practical ways to manage your stress in the lead-up to this big project. How do you think you could realistically balance your academic demands with self-care practices? Maybe we can create a more structured plan for your week, including specific times for mindfulness and journaling, even if it’s just for a short period each day. 

Additionally, it might be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself, both academically and in terms of self-care. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed and make the tasks feel more manageable. 

Lastly, let’s discuss some relaxation techniques you can use when you start feeling anxious. Techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or short mindfulness exercises can be very effective in managing stress in the moment. 

What do you think about trying to integrate some of these strategies into your routine?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I think setting specific times for mindfulness and journaling could really help. Maybe I could start with just 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes before bed. It’s not much, but it’s better than nothing.

Setting small goals sounds good too. I’ve been trying to tackle everything at once, which is probably why I’m feeling so overwhelmed. Breaking things down into smaller tasks might make it easier to handle.

As for relaxation techniques, I’ve tried deep breathing before, but I’m not sure I’m doing it right. Could you walk me through it? I think having something concrete to follow might help me stick with it when I’m feeling anxious.

Therapist: : That's a great approach, Naomi. Let's break it down step by step for the deep breathing technique so you can practice it effectively. Deep breathing can be a powerful tool to help you manage stress and anxiety.

### Deep Breathing Technique

1. **Find a Quiet Space**: Choose a quiet spot where you can sit or lie down comfortably. Make sure you won't be disturbed for the next few minutes.

2. **Get Comfortable**: Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. You can place a pillow or cushion under your back if you're sitting.

3. **Focus on Your Breath**: Take a moment to focus on your breath. Feel the air as it enters and leaves your body.

4. **Inhale Slowly**: Close your eyes and inhale through your nose. Count to four as you breathe in. Try to draw the air down into your lower belly, rather than just your chest.

5. **Hold Your Breath**: After inhaling, hold your breath for a moment. Count to four.

6. **Exhale Slowly**: Now, exhale through your mouth. Count to four as you breathe out. Imagine all the tension leaving your body as you exhale.

7. **Repeat**: Continue this cycle of inhaling (4), holding (4), and exhaling (4) for several rounds. You can start with 4 rounds and gradually increase the number as you get more comfortable with the technique.

### Example:
- **Inhale** for 4 seconds: \(\in \)
- **Hold** for 4 seconds: \(\in \in \)
- **Exhale** for 4 seconds: \(\in \in \in \)
- **Repeat** for 4 rounds.

### Additional Tips:
- **Consistency is Key**: Practice this technique daily, even if you don’t feel anxious. It will become more effective over time.
- **Use a Timer**: You can use a timer on your phone to remind you to take a few deep breaths throughout the day, especially when you feel stressed.
- **Make it a Habit**: Try to incorporate deep breathing into your daily routine, like during your morning and evening mindfulness sessions.

Let's give this a try right now. I’ll guide you through a round of deep breathing, and you can follow along.

### Guided Deep Breathing Practice:
- **Inhale** for 4 seconds: \(\in \)
- **Hold** for 4 seconds: \(\in \in \)
- **Exhale** for 4 seconds: \(\in \in \in \)

Repeat this cycle for 4 rounds.

Take a moment to feel the difference in your body. How do you feel now?

Patient: Thanks for the detailed explanation, Nova. I think I can manage that. Let's give it a try.

- **Inhale** for 4 seconds: \(\in \)
- **Hold** for 4 seconds: \(\in \in \)
- **Exhale** for 4 seconds: \(\in \in \in \)

- **Inhale** for 4 seconds: \(\in \)
- **Hold** for 4 seconds: \(\in \in \)
- **Exhale** for 4 seconds: \(\in \in \in \)

- **Inhale** for 4 seconds: \(\in \)
- **Hold** for 4 seconds: \(\in \in \)
- **Exhale** for 4 seconds: \(\in \in \in \)

- **Inhale** for 4 seconds: \(\in \)
- **Hold** for 4 seconds: \(\in \in \)
- **Exhale** for 4 seconds: \(\in \in \in \)

I feel a bit calmer now. It's surprising how just a few minutes of deep breathing can make a difference. I think I'll try to incorporate this into my daily routine, especially during those high-stress moments.

Therapist: : That’s fantastic, Naomi! It’s great to see how effectively you're able to use the deep breathing technique. You’re doing exactly the right thing by incorporating it into your daily routine, especially during high-stress moments.

Let's summarize and solidify our plan:

1. **Structured Self-Care Plan**:
   - Set aside 10 minutes for mindfulness in the morning.
   - Set aside 10 minutes for journaling before bed.
   - Gradually increase the time as you get more comfortable with these routines.

2. **Breaking Down Tasks**:
   - Break down your project into smaller, manageable tasks.
   - Set daily or weekly goals to ensure steady progress.

3. **Deep Breathing and Relaxation**:
   - Practice deep breathing for 4 rounds (4 seconds inhale, 4 seconds hold, 4 seconds exhale) multiple times a day, especially when you feel stressed.
   - Consider using a timer on your phone to remind you to take these breaks.

4. **Additional Techniques**:
   - Explore other relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation or short mindfulness exercises.
   - Consider using apps or videos to guide you through these techniques if you find them helpful.

5. **Support and Accountability**:
   - Consider setting up a small accountability system with a friend or classmate who can support you in sticking to your self-care plan.
   - If you find that the pressure from your advisor is too much, consider discussing your feelings and needs with them in a calm and respectful manner.

6. **Homework for Next Session**:
   - Practice your deep breathing routine for 5-10 minutes each day.
   - Reflect on how breaking down your project into smaller tasks has affected your stress levels.
   - Note any moments where you felt particularly stressed and used your deep breathing technique.

Would you like to set some specific goals for the week ahead based on these strategies? This can help keep you on track and focused.

What do you think about setting some specific goals for the next week?

Patient: That sounds like a solid plan, Nova. I think setting specific goals for the week ahead will really help me stay on track. Here are a few goals I can commit to:

1. **Mindfulness and Journaling**:
   - Spend 10 minutes on mindfulness every morning.
   - Journal for 10 minutes before bed each night.

2. **Project Breakdown**:
   - Break down my big project into at least three smaller tasks.
   - Set daily goals to complete one of these tasks each day.

3. **Deep Breathing**:
   - Practice deep breathing for 5 minutes, twice a day (morning and evening).
   - Use a timer to remind me to take these breaks.

4. **Support and Accountability**:
   - Share my goals with a close friend from my LGBTQ+ support network.
   - Check in with them once a week to discuss my progress.

I think these goals are achievable and will help me manage my stress better. I’m looking forward to seeing how they work out.

   - If you decide to have a conversation with your advisor, it might be helpful to prepare some points beforehand. You could discuss your current workload, any challenges you're facing, and potential solutions you're considering. Remember, communication is a two-way street, and your advisor might have some helpful suggestions as well.

6. **Celebrate Small Wins**:
   - Make sure to celebrate small victories along the way. Recognizing and appreciating your efforts can boost your motivation and help you stay positive.
