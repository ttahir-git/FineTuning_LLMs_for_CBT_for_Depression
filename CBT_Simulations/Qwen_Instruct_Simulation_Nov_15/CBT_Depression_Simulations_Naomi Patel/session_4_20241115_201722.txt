Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again. Thank you for summarizing our last session. I noticed that you've made significant progress since our last meeting. Let's build on what we've already accomplished and see how we can enhance your strategies further.

1. **Review and Adjust Pomodoro Technique Implementation**
2. **Expand Mindfulness Practices**
3. **Enhance Affirmation Strategies**
4. **Refine Weekly Reviews and Progress Journaling**
5. **Explore More Community Engagement Opportunities**

### Review and Adjust Pomodoro Technique Implementation:
- Have you noticed any tasks that require longer or shorter intervals? How can we adjust your hybrid Pomodoro approach to better fit these tasks?
- Are there specific activities where you find the 25/45-minute intervals too short or long? Let's tweak the intervals based on your feedback.

### Expand Mindfulness Practices:
- We've been incorporating brief mindfulness exercises during breaks. Could we explore some more structured mindfulness practices, such as guided meditations or breathing exercises?
- How do you feel about adding a mindfulness practice before you start your workday? This could help set a positive and focused tone.

### Enhance Affirmation Strategies:
- Have you noticed any specific affirmations that resonate more with you? Let's refine your affirmation cards and perhaps add some new ones.
- How are you using your affirmation cards? Have you shared any of them with a friend or family member for support?

### Refine Weekly Reviews and Progress Journaling:
- How have your structured weekly reviews been going? Are there any areas where you feel you need to spend more time reviewing?
- Have you found the progress journal helpful? Are there any elements you would like to add or modify to make it more effective?

### Explore More Community Engagement Opportunities:

- Could you share any experiences or insights you've gained from community engagement so far?

Feel free to share any thoughts or concerns you might have. Let's work together to make these strategies even more effective for you.

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to be back.

### Review and Adjust Pomodoro Technique Implementation:
- I've noticed that reading academic papers and writing long essays feel better with longer intervals, like 45 minutes. But for quick tasks like checking emails or organizing notes, 25 minutes is perfect. I think keeping the hybrid approach but adjusting the tasks to fit the intervals would work well.

### Expand Mindfulness Practices:
- I've tried a few guided meditations during breaks, and they really help me relax. Adding a mindfulness practice before starting my workday sounds like a great idea. It could help me get into the right mindset.

### Enhance Affirmation Strategies:
- Some affirmations about my academic abilities and resilience really resonate with me. I haven't shared them with anyone yet, but maybe I could start with my sister. She's been really supportive.

### Refine Weekly Reviews and Progress Journaling:
- My weekly reviews have been helpful, especially for reflecting on what worked and what didn't. I think spending more time on reviewing my emotional state and stress levels could be beneficial. The progress journal is useful, but I might add more details about my mindfulness practices and affirmations.

### Explore More Community Engagement Opportunities:
- I haven't joined any virtual support groups yet, but I'm considering it. It feels a bit

Therapist: That's great to hear, Naomi. It sounds like you're making some excellent adjustments and progress. Let's dive deeper into each of your points and see how we can continue to support you in your journey.

### Review and Adjust Pomodoro Technique Implementation:
- **Task Adjustments**: Great observation about the different needs for academic papers and essays versus quick tasks like checking emails. Adjusting your intervals to 45 minutes for more in-depth work and 25 minutes for shorter tasks is a smart move. Let's set up a quick checklist to remind you which tasks might benefit from longer intervals.

### Expand Mindfulness Practices:
- **Guided Meditations and Morning Mindfulness**: Starting your day with a brief guided meditation or a morning mindfulness practice can indeed set a positive tone. Perhaps we can explore specific guided meditations that are around 5-10 minutes long to fit into your routine easily. This could help you start the day feeling more centered and focused.

### Enhance Affirmation Strategies:
- **Affirmation Sharing**: Sharing your affirmations with a supportive person like your sister can be very beneficial. You might want to create a small group of trusted friends or family members who can provide mutual support and encouragement. Consider setting up a regular check-in with this group to discuss your affirmations and share any challenges you're facing.

### Refine Weekly Reviews and Progress Journaling:
- **Emotional and Stress Reviews**: Adding a section in your weekly review for your emotional state and stress levels is a good idea. This can help you identify patterns and triggers. You might also consider rating your stress levels on a scale from 1 to 10 to make it easier to track changes over time. For your progress journal, adding notes on your mindfulness practices and affirmations can indeed make it more comprehensive and useful.

### Explore More Community Engagement Opportunities:
- **Virtual Support Groups**: Joining a virtual support group can provide you with a sense of community and ongoing support. It might feel a bit daunting, but it can be incredibly rewarding. Here are a few steps to help you start:
  1. Research online for support groups related to your interests and challenges.
  2. Attend a few meetings to see if it feels right for you.
  3. Start by sharing your experiences in a supportive, non-judgmental environment.
  4. Consider starting a small group within your existing support network to foster a sense of community.

Feel free to take your time with these steps. Let's celebrate the progress you've made so far and work together to continue building on it.

How do you feel about taking these next steps? Are there any particular areas you'd like to focus on first?

Patient: Thanks for breaking it down, Nova. It helps to have a clear plan.

### Review and Adjust Pomodoro Technique Implementation:
- I like the idea of a checklist for task intervals. It would make it easier to remember which tasks need longer focus. I'll start working on that today.

### Expand Mindfulness Practices:
- Morning mindfulness sounds perfect. I'll look for some 5-10 minute guided meditations to start my day. It should fit well into my routine without feeling overwhelming.

### Enhance Affirmation Strategies:
- Sharing affirmations with my sister is a good first step. I'll create a small group with her and maybe a couple of close friends. Regular check-ins sound supportive and manageable.

### Refine Weekly Reviews and Progress Journaling:
- Adding an emotional and stress review section to my weekly check-ins is a great idea. I'll start rating my stress levels to track patterns. I'll also add more details about my mindfulness practices and affirmations to my progress journal.

### Explore More Community Engagement Opportunities:
- Joining a virtual support group feels a bit daunting, but I'll start by researching some options. I'll attend a few meetings to see how it feels. Starting a small group within my existing support network is a good backup plan.
