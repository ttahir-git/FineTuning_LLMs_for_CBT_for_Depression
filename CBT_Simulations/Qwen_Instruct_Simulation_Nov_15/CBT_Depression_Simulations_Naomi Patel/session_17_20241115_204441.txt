Therapist: : Hi Naomi, it's great to see you again. From the summary, it sounds like we've made some good progress in the last session and have implemented some effective strategies. How are you feeling about these changes? Have you noticed any particular improvements or challenges in applying these techniques in your daily life? Also, could you share a bit about how your group project anxiety has been affecting you lately? We can work on refining your strategies further to manage this anxiety.

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to see you too. I've been trying to stick to the structured breaks and time management, and I think they're helping a bit. I've noticed that I feel less burnt out by the end of the day, which is a big improvement. However, I'm still struggling with the gratitude practice. I keep forgetting to write in the journal, and when I do remember, it feels a bit forced.

As for the group project anxiety, it's been pretty intense lately. I have a big deadline coming up, and I'm worried about not contributing enough or letting the team down. I've been trying to break down the tasks as we discussed, but I still feel this overwhelming sense of pressure. I haven't talked to my group members about it yet; I'm not sure how to bring it up without sounding like I'm making excuses.

Therapist: : Hi Naomi, it's good to hear that you're finding the structured breaks and time management helpful. It's not uncommon to struggle with the gratitude practice initially, especially when it feels forced. Let's work on making it a more natural part of your routine. Perhaps we can adjust the gratitude exercise to focus on things you can observe more easily, like the environment around you or something positive that happens during your day.

Regarding your group project anxiety, it's important to address these feelings openly. Here are a few strategies we can try:

1. **Communication with the Group**: Schedule a meeting with your group members to discuss your concerns. Frame it as a proactive approach rather than an excuse. You could say something like, "Hey, I wanted to bring up some thoughts I’ve had about our project. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed, and I think it would help if we set some clearer expectations and deadlines for ourselves."

2. **Delegating Tasks**: Since you're worried about not contributing enough, consider discussing how each team member can take on specific roles that play to their strengths. This can help distribute the workload and reduce the pressure on you.

3. **Regular Check-ins**: Propose regular check-ins where each member can discuss their progress and any challenges they're facing. This can help ensure everyone is on track and provides a supportive environment.

4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: We can add some mindfulness exercises to your daily routine to help you manage stress. Perhaps a short mindfulness meditation or deep breathing exercises can be included in your structured breaks.

5. **Positive Reinforcement**: When you do something well in the project, no matter how small, take a moment to acknowledge it. This can help build your confidence and reduce anxiety.

Let's try to integrate some of these strategies into your routine and see how they work for you. If you need more support, we can also explore how to frame these discussions with your group members in a way that feels more natural and less confrontational.

Patient: Thanks for the suggestions, Nova. I think focusing on more observable things for the gratitude practice might help. I can try to notice small positive moments throughout the day, like a nice breeze or a good conversation.

As for the group project, I like the idea of scheduling a meeting to discuss my concerns. I'll try to frame it as a proactive step rather than just expressing my worries. I'll also suggest regular check-ins and delegating tasks based on strengths. I think those could really help.

Mindfulness exercises during my breaks sound like a good addition too. I've tried deep breathing before, and it did help a bit, so maybe I can incorporate that more regularly.

I'll start with these strategies and see how it goes. If I run into any issues or need more help, I'll let you know.

Therapist: : Hi Naomi, I'm glad to hear you're open to trying these adjustments. Focusing on observable positive moments for your gratitude practice is a great idea, and it can make the exercise feel more natural and enjoyable. Regular check-ins and delegating tasks based on strengths are excellent strategies to alleviate the pressure you're feeling.

Incorporating mindfulness exercises during your breaks is a fantastic way to manage stress. If you need any specific guided meditations or breathing exercises, I can provide some resources to help you get started. Deep breathing is a simple yet powerful technique, and consistent practice can significantly reduce anxiety and improve your overall well-being.

Regarding your group project, framing your discussion as a proactive step is a good approach. You might want to prepare some points to share in the meeting to make it more structured and less anxiety-inducing. Here’s a suggested outline you could use:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly explain that you're bringing up these points to help the team succeed.
2. **Your Concerns**: Clearly state your concerns about the project. For example, "I’m worried that we might not have enough time to complete everything as expected, and I want to ensure we're all on the same page."
3. **Suggestions**: Offer specific suggestions for how to address these concerns, such as setting clear deadlines, breaking tasks into smaller steps, and assigning roles based on strengths.
4. **Closing**: Thank them for their understanding and willingness to work together.

Here’s an example of what you might say:

"Hey everyone, I wanted to discuss a few points regarding our project. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed and want to ensure we’re all on the same page. To start, we might consider setting more specific deadlines for each task to keep everyone accountable. I think it would also be helpful if we could break down the larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Additionally, could we discuss who might be best suited for which roles based on our strengths? I believe this could help streamline our work and ensure we all feel supported. I really value our team and want to contribute effectively, so let’s work together to make this project a success."

If you need any help drafting this or feel more comfortable practicing what you might say, I’d be happy to assist. Also, if you decide to start the meeting with these points, it’s important to remain open to feedback and suggestions from your group members. Everyone's input can be valuable and can help foster a collaborative and supportive environment.

Let’s keep this up and see how these strategies work for you. If you run into any specific issues or need further support, feel free to reach out. I’m here to help.

Take care and good luck with your project!
