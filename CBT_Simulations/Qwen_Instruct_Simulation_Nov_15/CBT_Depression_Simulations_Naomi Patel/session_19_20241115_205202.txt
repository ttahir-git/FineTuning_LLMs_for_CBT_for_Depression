Session Number: 19

Patient: Hi, I'm Naomi Patel. This is my 19 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

I understand how challenging it can be to balance family expectations with your own well-being and goals. Let's work on strategies to help you manage these pressures and establish healthy boundaries:

1. **Understanding Your Own Goals and Values**:
- Take time to reflect on what YOU want to achieve
- Write down your personal academic and career goals
- Consider what success means to you personally
- Identify areas where family expectations align or differ from your goals

2. **Communicating with Family**:
- Have an honest conversation about how you're feeling
- Use "I" statements: "I feel overwhelmed when..."
- Share your goals and plans with them
- Express appreciation for their care while setting boundaries
- Help them understand that excessive pressure can be counterproductive

3. **Setting Realistic Boundaries**:
- Learn to say "no" when needed
- Set limits on discussions about grades and academic performance
- Establish times when academic topics are off-limits
- Create space for other aspects of your life

4. **Managing Family Expectations**:
- Share your progress in a way that feels comfortable to you
- Help them understand your challenges and limitations
- Educate them about mental health and academic stress
- Involve them in your success planning in a healthy way

5. **Self-Care Strategies**:
- Practice self-compassion
- Remind yourself that your worth isn't tied to academic performance
- Take breaks when needed
- Maintain activities and relationships outside of academics

Would you like to explore any of these areas in more detail? We can work on specific phrases or strategies that might help in conversations with your family.

Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again. It sounds like we have a solid plan from our last session to help you navigate family pressures and maintain your well-being. Let's dive into exploring a couple of these areas a bit more deeply today. 

First, how are you feeling about setting and communicating your boundaries with your family? Have you had any thoughts or experiences since our last session that you'd like to discuss? Perhaps we can start by focusing on the **Communicating with Family** section and work on some specific phrases or scenarios you might encounter. This can help you feel more prepared and confident when talking to your family.

For example, if you're feeling overwhelmed by family expectations, it might be helpful to practice how to express your feelings and set boundaries. We could work on a few different scenarios, such as:

1. **Discussing Feelings**: How might you express your feelings about the current academic pressure without blaming anyone?
2. **Setting Boundaries**: What are some specific limits you might set, and how can you communicate these effectively?
3. **Educating Family Members**: How can you explain to your family that excessive pressure might not be beneficial for your mental health and overall well-being?

Let's start with the first scenario: how do you feel about expressing your feelings about the current academic pressure? Are there any specific situations or conversations where you've felt this pressure recently?

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to see you too. I've been thinking a lot about setting boundaries with my family, especially since our last session. I had a particularly tough conversation with my mom last week about my academic performance. She was asking about my grades, and I could feel the pressure building up. I tried to explain how I'm feeling, but it didn't go as smoothly as I hoped.

I think the **Discussing Feelings** part is really hard for me. I want to be honest about how overwhelmed I feel, but I also don't want to disappoint them or make them worry more. I guess I'm not sure how to express my feelings without sounding like I'm blaming them or making excuses.

One specific situation that comes to mind is when my mom asked me why I didn't get an A on a recent assignment. I felt like I had to justify my performance, and it made me feel even more stressed. I want to be able to say something like, "I'm doing my best, and that's what matters," but I'm not sure how to phrase it in a way that doesn't sound defensive.

Can we work on some phrases or ways to express my feelings about academic pressure without making it seem like I'm blaming anyone?

Therapist: Hi Naomi, it's great that you've been reflecting on these situations and feeling more aware of how you're managing the pressure. Let's work on crafting some phrases that can help you communicate your feelings more effectively and reduce the stress in these conversations.

Here are a few suggestions for expressing your feelings in a way that doesn't blame or make excuses:

1. **Empathetic Communication**: Start by acknowledging their concern and validating their feelings.
   - "I understand how much you care about my success, and I know how much you want the best for me."

2. **Expressing Your Feelings**: Share your thoughts and feelings in a non-defensive manner.
   - "I feel really overwhelmed right now with all the assignments and exams. I'm doing my best, but sometimes I need a bit more time and support to manage everything."

3. **Setting Boundaries**: Clearly state your limits and needs.
   - "I know it's important for you to know how I'm doing, but could we talk about my progress on my terms? I can share what I've learned and what I plan to do next, but I don't need to get into every detail right now."

4. **Focusing on Positive Steps**: Emphasize your efforts and the steps you're taking.
   - "I've been working really hard to improve my study habits and manage my time better. I'm trying to balance all my commitments, and I need a bit more support and flexibility to achieve this."

5. **Offering Solutions**: Suggest ways to support each other.
   - "I would really appreciate it if we could find a way to make sure I'm not too stressed. Maybe we could have a set time each week to discuss my progress, and in the meantime, I can keep you updated on my own terms."

Let's practice a few scenarios to make this feel more natural for you. For example:

- **Scenario 1**: Your mom asks why you didn't get an A on a recent assignment.
  - You: "Mom, I understand you care about my grades, and I know I can do better. I'm really working hard on this, and sometimes I face unexpected challenges. I've been spending extra time reviewing and practicing, but I need to give myself more time to ensure I do my best. Can we set up a time to discuss my progress in a few weeks?"

- **Scenario 2**: Your dad is asking about your upcoming exam.
  - You: "Dad, I know you're concerned about my exams. I'm doing my best to prepare, and I have a good study plan in place. I just need a bit more time to focus on my studies without feeling pressured. Can we talk about my progress when I have more updates to share?"

Would you like to practice any of these scenarios or explore any other areas in more detail?

Patient: Thanks for these suggestions, Nova. I think practicing these scenarios will really help. Let's start with **Scenario 1**: My mom asking why I didn't get an A on a recent assignment.

You: "Mom, I understand you care about my grades, and I know I can do better. I'm really working hard on this, and sometimes I face unexpected challenges. I've been spending extra time reviewing and practicing, but I need to give myself more time to ensure I do my best. Can we set up a time to discuss my progress in a few weeks?"

That sounds a lot better than how I usually respond. I can see how starting with empathy and then explaining my feelings and needs can make the conversation less stressful.

Now, for **Scenario 2**: My dad asking about my upcoming exam.

You: "Dad, I know you're concerned about my exams. I'm doing my best to prepare, and I have a good study plan in place. I just need a bit more time to focus on my studies without feeling pressured. Can we talk about my progress when I have more updates to share?"

This one also feels more balanced. I like how it acknowledges his concern but also sets a boundary for when we can discuss it further.

Can we maybe work on one more scenario? I often feel pressured when my parents ask about my future career plans, especially since they have

Therapist: : Of course, Naomi. Let's work on a scenario involving your parents' questions about your future career plans. This can be a sensitive topic, so it's great to have strategies to handle these conversations effectively.

**Scenario 3**: Your parents ask about your future career plans and how you're progressing in your field of interest.

You: "Mom and Dad, I appreciate your interest in my future career plans. I know it's important to you, and I value your support. Right now, I'm still exploring different options and figuring out what I'm passionate about. I'm taking some time to gain experience and knowledge in my field of interest, which includes internships and coursework. I'm really enjoying this process and learning a lot, but it's also important for me to take my time and make sure I make the right decisions. Would you be open to hearing more about my experiences and thoughts when I have updates to share?"

This approach shows that you're taking their interest seriously while also setting clear boundaries and sharing your process openly. It's important to let them know that you value their input and support, but you also need space to figure things out.

Now, let's practice these scenarios together. I'll start with Scenario 1, and we can go from there.

**Practice Scenario 1**:
You: "Mom, I understand you care about my grades, and I know I can do better. I'm really working hard on this, and sometimes I face unexpected challenges. I've been spending extra time reviewing and practicing, but I need to give myself more time to ensure I do my best. Can we set up a time to discuss my progress in a few weeks?"

Let's practice this together. You can start by saying, "Mom, I understand you care about my grades, and I know I can do better... " and then continue with the rest of the sentence.

Would you like to give it a try now?

Patient: Sure, let's give it a try.

"Mom, I understand you care about my grades, and I know I can do better. I'm really working hard on this, and sometimes I face unexpected challenges. I've been spending extra time reviewing and practicing, but I need to give myself more time to ensure I do my best. Can we set up a time to discuss my progress in a few weeks?"

That felt a bit more natural. I can see how this approach can help me communicate my feelings without sounding defensive.

Now, for **Scenario 3**:

"Mom and Dad, I appreciate your interest in my future career plans. I know it's important to you, and I value your support. Right now, I'm still exploring different options and figuring out what I'm passionate about. I'm taking some time to gain experience and knowledge in my field of interest, which includes internships and coursework. I'm really enjoying this process and learning a lot, but it's also important for me to take my time and make sure I make the right decisions. Would you be open to hearing more about my experiences and thoughts when I have updates to share?"

This one also feels more balanced. I like how it acknowledges their concern but also sets a boundary for when we can discuss it further.

Thanks for helping me practice these scenarios, Nova. I feel more confident about having these conversations now

Therapist: : You're welcome, Naomi! It's great to hear that you feel more confident after practicing these scenarios. Remember, the key is to be clear, honest, and compassionate in your communication. Here are a few more tips to keep in mind:

1. **Be Prepared**: Before having these conversations, take some time to reflect on your current situation and any specific concerns or experiences you want to share. This can help you feel more prepared and less anxious.

2. **Stay Calm and Focused**: Try to keep your emotions in check. If you feel yourself getting overwhelmed, take a few deep breaths or take a short break before continuing the conversation.

3. **Seek Support**: If you find that these conversations are particularly challenging, it might be helpful to involve a trusted friend, teacher, or counselor who can support you and help mediate if needed.

4. **Follow Up**: After the conversation, it might be beneficial to send a follow-up message or email to summarize key points or offer additional details. This can help keep the lines of communication open and ensure both parties are on the same page.

Let's review a couple of other areas from our previous plan to see if there's anything you'd like to focus on further:

1. **Understanding Your Own Goals and Values**: Have you had time to reflect on your personal academic and career goals? Is there anything specific you want to work on in this area?

2. **Setting Realistic Boundaries**: Have you started implementing some of the boundaries we discussed? How are things going?

3. **Self-Care Strategies**: How have you been practicing self-compassion and taking breaks? Are there any activities or hobbies that have helped you manage stress?

Feel free to share any thoughts or questions you have about these areas, or let me know if you want to explore something else. We can also set some specific goals or行动计划 for the coming weeks to help you continue making progress.

Patient: Thanks for these additional tips, Nova. They're really helpful.

1. **Understanding Your Own Goals and Values**: I've been reflecting on my personal academic and career goals, and I think I'm starting to get a clearer picture. I want to focus on researching the impact of climate change on coastal communities, especially since it's something that deeply affects my family's roots in Gujarat. I'm also considering ways to combine my environmental activism with my academic work.

2. **Setting Realistic Boundaries**: I've started implementing some boundaries, like setting specific times to discuss my academic progress with my parents. It's been a bit challenging, but I think it's helping. I've also been trying to limit the number of times they ask about my grades, which has reduced some of the pressure.

3. **Self-Care Strategies**: I've been practicing self-compassion by reminding myself that my worth isn't tied to my academic performance. I've also been taking more breaks and trying to engage in activities I enjoy, like poetry writing and vegetarian cooking. These hobbies have been really helpful in managing stress.

I think setting specific goals for the coming weeks would be really beneficial. Maybe we can focus on:

- **Goal 1**: Continue practicing and refining my communication strategies with my parents, especially around academic pressure and future career plans.
- **Goal 2**: Ded

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and encouragement. I'll make sure to stick to the schedule and stay consistent.

One thing I'm a bit concerned about is how to handle situations where my parents might not respect the boundaries I've set. For example, if they continue to ask about my grades or career plans outside of our agreed-upon times. Do you have any specific strategies for dealing with that?

Also, I noticed that I didn't include any time for physical activity in my weekly schedule. I think adding some form of exercise could be beneficial for my overall well-being. Do you have any suggestions for incorporating that into my routine?

Therapist: : Great to hear that you're committed to sticking to the schedule, Naomi! Let's address your concerns and add some physical activity to your routine.

### Handling Boundaries with Your Parents
When your parents continue to ask about your grades or career plans outside of your agreed-upon times, here are some strategies you can use:

1. **Prepared Responses**: Have prepared responses ready, such as "Thank you for your interest. Let's discuss this during our scheduled time next week." or "I appreciate your concern, but I'll share my progress at our next meeting."

2. **Consistency**: Be consistent in your responses. This helps build a pattern of communication that sets clear expectations.

3. **Redirect**: If they persist, you can try redirecting the conversation to a different topic that doesn't involve grades or career plans. For example, "I know you're concerned, but let's talk about our family outing next weekend instead."

4. **Educate Gently**: Occasionally, you might need to educate them gently on why respecting your boundaries is important for your well-being. You can say, "I value your input, but I need some time to manage my stress levels. Let's set a specific time to discuss these topics to avoid overwhelming me."

5. **Support System**: Lean on a trusted family member or friend who can help mediate or provide support when needed.

### Adding Physical Activity to Your Routine
Incorporating physical activity is a fantastic idea! Here are a few ways to include it in your schedule:

1. **Daily Walk**: Start with a short daily walk (15-30 minutes) around your neighborhood or in a local park. This can be a great way to break up your day and get some fresh air.

2. **Structured Exercise**: Include a structured exercise routine, such as yoga, Pilates, or a light workout, a couple of times a week. Even a 20-minute session can make a significant difference.

3. **Group Activities**: Join a local sports team or a fitness class. This can provide a sense of community and motivation.

4. **Active Hobbies**: Engage in active hobbies like dancing, hiking, or biking. These can be both fun and fulfilling.

5. **Scheduled Breaks**: Incorporate physical activity as part of your self-care routine. For example, take a 5-minute walk during your breaks or do some stretching exercises.

### Revised Weekly Schedule Example
- **Monday**: Practice communication strategy (30 minutes) + Journaling (10 minutes) + 20-minute walk
- **Tuesday**: Self-care routine (15-20 minutes) + Mindfulness practice (5 minutes) + Yoga class
