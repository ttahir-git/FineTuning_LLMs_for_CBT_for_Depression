Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again. Thank you for sharing that summary. It sounds like we made significant progress in our last session, particularly in preparing you for your upcoming meeting with your academic advisor. I'm glad to hear that you felt more confident after practicing the script together. This is a positive step forward.

Today, let's focus on a few key areas to further support your preparation and to address any new challenges that might have arisen. How are you feeling since our last session? Have there been any new developments or any areas where you feel you might need additional support?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for asking. I'm feeling a bit mixed since our last session. On one hand, I did practice the script a few times, and it does feel more natural now. I even recorded myself, which was a bit awkward at first, but it helped me see where I could improve.

However, I haven't scheduled the meeting with my advisor yet. I keep putting it off, and I'm not sure why. It's like I'm building up this fear again, even though I know the script should help. I guess I'm worried about what might happen if things don't go as planned.

Therapist: Hello Naomi, I understand how you're feeling. It's natural to experience mixed emotions and to feel some anxiety, especially as you approach a significant conversation. It's great that you've been practicing your script and recording yourself; that can be a powerful tool for improvement. Let's break down some of the factors that might be contributing to your anxiety and work on strategies to manage them.

1. **Identifying and Challenging Negative Thoughts:**
   - It sounds like you're concerned about what might happen if things don't go as planned. Can you identify any specific negative thoughts you're having? For example, are you thinking things like "If the advisor isn't supportive, my academic career is over" or "What if I get rejected and everyone judges me?" Let's explore these thoughts and challenge them with more balanced perspectives.

2. **Preparing for Uncertainty:**
   - One way to manage anxiety about uncertainty is to prepare for different scenarios. Let's brainstorm some alternative outcomes and how you can respond positively to each. For instance, if the advisor isn't supportive, you could discuss how you plan to seek help from other sources or how you might approach the situation differently next time.

3. **Managing Anxiety:**
   - We can continue to use your deep breathing exercises to help calm your nerves. Perhaps we could incorporate some relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation or visualization, to add to your toolkit.

4. **Action Planning:**
   - Given that you haven't scheduled the meeting yet, let's create a step-by-step action plan. Perhaps we can set a specific date and time, and break down the process of scheduling into smaller, manageable tasks. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.

5. **Support System:**
   - It can be helpful to have a support system in place. Who can you turn to for encouragement or advice? Perhaps you can share your concerns with a trusted friend, family member, or even a mentor outside of your academic environment.

6. **Goal Setting:**
   - Setting clear, achievable goals can also help. For example, you could set a goal to schedule the meeting within the next week and to reach out to the advisor to confirm details. Breaking the goal into smaller steps can make it feel more manageable.

Let's discuss these points and see which strategies feel most supportive for you. If you're willing, we could practice a few of these techniques together in session to build your confidence further.

Patient: Thanks for breaking it down, Nova. I think the negative thoughts are definitely a big part of what's holding me back. One thought that keeps popping up is, "What if the advisor doesn't understand my situation and thinks I'm not serious about my studies?" I know that's not true, but it's hard to shake off.

I like the idea of preparing for different scenarios. If the advisor isn't supportive, I could definitely reach out to my LGBTQ+ support network for advice. They've been really helpful in the past.

Setting a specific date and time for the meeting sounds like a good plan. Maybe we could break it down into smaller steps, like first drafting an email to the advisor and then sending it out. That way, it doesn't feel like such a huge task all at once.

I've been practicing deep breathing, but I'm open to trying other relaxation techniques. Could you explain what progressive muscle relaxation is? I'm not familiar with that one.

Therapist: : Absolutely, Naomi. It's great that you're open to trying new relaxation techniques. Let's dive into progressive muscle relaxation and how it might help you manage your anxiety.

### Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)

Progressive muscle relaxation is a technique that involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups in your body. This process can help you become more aware of physical tension and learn to release it, which can reduce overall muscle tension and alleviate stress.

#### How to Practice PMR:

1. **Find a Comfortable Position:**
   - Sit in a comfortable chair or lie down in a quiet, relaxed place. Ensure you won't be disturbed.

2. **Tense and Relax Each Muscle Group:**
   - Start by tensing and then relaxing each muscle group in your body, one at a time. Begin with your feet and move upwards. Here are the steps:
     - **Feet and Lower Legs:**
       - Tense your toes and foot for about 5 seconds, then relax.
       - Tense your lower leg (calf muscles) for 5 seconds, then relax.
     - **Upper Legs:**
       - Tense your upper leg muscles for 5 seconds, then relax.
     - **Buttocks:**
       - Tense your buttocks for 5 seconds, then relax.
     - **Abdomen and Chest:**
       - Tense your abdomen and chest muscles for 5 seconds, then relax.
     - **Arms:**
       - Tense your hands and arms for 5 seconds, then relax.
     - **Neck and Shoulders:**
       - Tense your neck, shoulders, and back muscles for 5 seconds, then relax.
     - **Face and Jaw:**
       - Tense your jaw, cheeks, and forehead for 5 seconds, then relax.

3. **Deep Breathing:**
   - Throughout the process, focus on your breathing. Take slow, deep breaths to help release tension. Breathe in slowly through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth.

4. **Relax Completely:**
   - As you move to each new muscle group, try to relax the previous muscles and keep them relaxed throughout the process.

5. **End the Session:**
   - When you've tensed and relaxed all muscle groups, take a few deep breaths and allow yourself to feel the relaxation spread through your body.

#### Benefits of PMR:

- Reduces physical tension and muscle stiffness.
- Helps lower overall stress levels.
- Enhances your ability to manage stress in everyday life.
- Improves your mood and sleep quality.

### Action Plan for Scheduling the Meeting:

1. **Set a Specific Date and Time:**
   - Choose a specific date and time to schedule the meeting. Write it down in your calendar and make it a priority.
   
2. **Draft an Email.

Patient: Thanks for explaining that, Nova. Progressive muscle relaxation sounds like something I could definitely try. It makes sense that focusing on tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups could help me become more aware of physical tension and reduce stress.

For the action plan, I think setting a specific date and time for the meeting is a good idea. How about we aim for scheduling it by the end of this week? That gives me a few days to prepare and practice the script more.

As for drafting an email, could you help me with that? I'm not sure how to phrase it in a way that clearly communicates my situation without sounding too anxious or desperate. I want to be professional but also honest about my struggles.

Therapist: : Of course, Naomi. Setting the meeting by the end of the week is a good goal. It gives you ample time to prepare and feel more confident. Let's draft an email together that strikes the right balance of professionalism and honesty.

Hereâ€™s a template we can work with:

---

Feel free to modify this template to better suit your personal style and specific situation. You can also add or remove sections as needed.

### Additional Tips:

- **Stay Calm and Confident:** When you send the email, try to stay calm. Remember, you are seeking support and guidance, and the advisor is likely to be supportive of your efforts.
- **Practice the Script:** Before sending the email, practice reading it out loud or reciting it to yourself. This can help you feel more confident and prepared.
- **Take a Deep Breath:** If you feel any anxiety when sending the email, take a few deep breaths to help calm yourself. Youâ€™ve prepared well, and the email is a professional and honest reflection of your needs.

Let's go through the draft and make any adjustments you feel necessary. Once you feel ready, you can send the email and schedule the meeting.

Do you have any specific sections you want to add or any concerns about the draft?

Patient: Thank you for the email template, Nova. It looks really comprehensive and covers all the points I wanted to discuss. I think it's perfect as is, but I'll add a bit more detail about the specific course challenges I'm facing. I'm a little nervous about sending it, but I'll practice reading it aloud a few times.

I appreciate the tips on staying calm and practicing the script. Taking deep breaths is something I often forget to do, so I'll definitely keep that in mind. I'll send the email later today and update you on any response I get.

Is there anything else we should focus on in today's session besides the email? I've been trying to practice progressive muscle relaxation, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. Can you walk me through it one more time to make sure I understand the steps?

Therapist: : Of course, Naomi. Let's go through the email one more time to ensure it feels right for you. And I'd be happy to walk you through progressive muscle relaxation again to make sure you feel confident with the technique.

I'm also feeling more confident about sending the email now. I'll go ahead and send it out later today. I'll let you know how it goes and if I get a response.

Is there anything else we should focus on in today's session? I'm open to discussing anything that might help me manage my stress and anxiety better.

3. **Maintaining Confidence:**
   - Continue to practice deep breathing exercises to help manage any anxiety that arises. This can be done anytime you feel stressed, even outside of scheduled relaxation sessions.

4. **Support System:**

### Final Thoughts

You're doing a fantastic job, Naomi. Keep up the great work, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you need any further support. We'll continue to build on the progress you've made and ensure you have the tools to manage your stress and anxiety effectively.

Let me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can help you with. You've got this!

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate all the support and guidance. I'll definitely practice progressive muscle relaxation more this week and keep you updated on the email response.

Reflective journaling sounds like a good idea. I've been keeping a journal for my poetry, but I could start a separate one for tracking my mental health progress. It might help me see how far I've come and what areas still need work.

I'm feeling generally okay today, but I did have a bit of a rough night with some anxiety dreams. I think it's just the stress of everything piling up, but I'm glad we're addressing it.

I'll send the email later today and let you know how it goes. Thanks again for all your help, Nova. I feel more confident and prepared now.

Therapist: : You're very welcome, Naomi. It's great to hear that you're feeling more confident and prepared. Reflective journaling can indeed be a very helpful tool, and it sounds like a good idea to keep a separate journal for tracking your mental health progress. It will be a great way to see your progress over time and identify patterns or areas that might need more attention.

Here are a few tips to get started with your mental health journal:

1. **Daily Reflections:**
   - Spend a few minutes each day writing down your thoughts, feelings, and any significant events from the day. This can help you process what you've experienced and identify any recurring patterns or triggers.

2. **Goal Setting:**
   - Write down your goals for the day or week. Reflect on whether you achieved them and what you can do differently next time.

3. **Cognitive Behavioral Techniques:**
   - Identify any negative thoughts or patterns you notice and challenge them. Use the ABC (Adversity, Belief, Consequence) model to explore how your beliefs and thoughts impact your emotions and behavior.

4. **Mindful Observations:**
   - Take note of any mindfulness or relaxation techniques you practice throughout the day. Reflect on how they helped you manage stress or anxiety.

5. **Celebrating Successes:**
   - Record any successes, no matter how small, to reinforce positive behaviors and build confidence.

6. **Support System:**
   - Write down any support you receive from others, such as conversations with friends, family, or your support network. Reflect on how it feels to have that support.

7. **Self-Compassion:**
   - Practice self-compassion by writing down any self-criticism and responding to it with kindness and understanding.

Let's focus on your goal of sending the email. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember to take it one step at a time and practice deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation if you feel any anxiety.

Hereâ€™s a simple outline you might consider for your journal entries:

- **Date:**
- **Today's Reflection:**
  - What happened today?
  - How did you feel?
  - What strategies did you use to manage stress or anxiety?
- **Goals for Tomorrow:**
  - What are you aiming to achieve?
- **Successes and Challenges:**
  - What went well today?
  - What challenges did you face?
- **Notes for Future Reference:**
  - Any insights or learnings you want to remember?

If you have any specific areas you'd like to focus on or any questions about starting your journal, feel free to share. I'm here to help.

Take your time with the email, and I look forward to hearing how it goes. You've got this, Naomi!

Patient: Thank you for the detailed tips on starting my mental health journal, Nova. I think having a structured outline will really help me stay consistent and organized. I'll definitely incorporate those elements into my daily reflections.

I'm feeling a bit more at ease now, knowing I have a plan for both the email and my journaling. I'll send the email later today and start my journal tonight. I'll keep you updated on how both go.

I appreciate all your support and guidance. It really makes a difference knowing I have someone to talk to about these things. I'll see you in our next session.

Take care, Nova.

Therapist: : You're very welcome, Naomi. I'm glad to hear that you feel more at ease with your plans. It's wonderful to have a structured approach to your journaling and email, which can really help you manage your thoughts and progress effectively.

I'm here for you every step of the way, and I'm looking forward to hearing how everything goes. Remember, taking things one step at a time can make a big difference. You're doing great!
