Therapist: : Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again. Thank you for summarizing our previous session. It's clear you've been working diligently on the tasks and exercises we discussed. Let's delve into how things have been going since then.

Firstly, how have you been with the "most important tasks" list and the food journal? Have you noticed any changes in your stress eating or emotional eating patterns? Also, how is your support network holding up? Are there any new developments with your mother's condition, and how are you managing your caregiving responsibilities?

On a positive note, it's wonderful to hear about the progress you've made with the church community and basketball league. Have you found these activities helpful in reducing stress and maintaining a better work-life balance?

Additionally, how are you managing your communication with your ex-wife? Have you had any successful check-ins or faced any challenges?

Lastly, how are you feeling about the mindfulness practices you've started incorporating into your routine? Have you noticed any changes in how you approach situations or handle stress?

Let's also discuss your homework. How have you been with the body scan meditation and mindful eating practices? Have you found them helpful? Is there anything you would like to explore further regarding additional support for your mother's care or professional caregiving options?

Let's work together to address any new challenges and reinforce the strategies that have been working well for you.

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for checking in. I've been trying to stick to that "most important tasks" list, and it's been helping me stay focused, especially with lesson planning. The food journal, though, that's been a bit tougher. I've noticed I still stress eat, especially late at night. It's like I can't resist that sweet potato pie my mom used to make.

My support network has been holding up pretty well. The church community and the basketball league have been great outlets. They really help me unwind and feel connected. My mom's condition is progressing slowly, and it's been challenging to balance her care with everything else. I've been looking into some local caregiver support groups, and I think that might help.

Communication with my ex-wife has been better. We've had some successful check-ins, and it's made co-parenting a bit smoother. We're still working on setting clear boundaries, but it's getting there.

As for the mindfulness practices, I've been trying the body scan meditation and mindful eating. They're helpful, but I still find it hard to fully engage in them. I think I need more practice. I'm also considering looking into professional caregiving options for my mom. It's a lot to handle on my own, and I think it might be time to get some professional help.

Overall

Therapist: Nova: Hi Marcus, thanks for sharing your progress and challenges. It's great to see you are committed to the "most important tasks" list and have found the support of the church and basketball league helpful. The struggle with the food journal is understandable, and it's good to acknowledge that it's taking time to adapt to new habits. Let's explore some strategies to help you manage stress eating more effectively.

Regarding your mother's care, it's commendable that you are actively seeking additional support through local caregiver support groups. This can be a significant relief and provide you with valuable insights and strategies. Additionally, considering professional caregiving options is a practical step towards managing the caregiving responsibilities more efficiently. It's important to take care of yourself first, so you can continue to support your mother and your other commitments.

For the mindfulness practices, remember that consistency is key. It might be helpful to start with shorter sessions and gradually increase the duration. Here are a few tips to make mindfulness more approachable:

1. **Set a Routine**: Try to make mindfulness a part of your daily routine, perhaps right after waking up or before going to bed.
2. **Start Small**: Begin with 5-10 minute sessions and gradually increase the time.
3. **Find a Comfortable Environment**: Create a quiet space where you can practice without interruptions.
4. **Use Guided Meditations**: There are many apps and online resources that offer guided meditations which can help you stay focused.
5. **Mindful Eating**: When eating, take time to notice the taste, texture, and smell of your food. This can help you recognize when you are eating out of emotional triggers.

It's also important to continue your regular check-ins with your ex-wife and ensure you are setting clear boundaries. Good communication can significantly ease the stress of co-parenting.

Let's discuss your homework further. How are you finding the body scan meditation and mindful eating practices? Have you noticed any changes in your stress levels or emotional state? Also, how are you progressing with your search for caregiver support groups and professional options?

Together, we can find ways to support you in managing your caregiving responsibilities, maintaining a balanced life, and improving your overall well-being.
