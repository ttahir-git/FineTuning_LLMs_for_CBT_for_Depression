Session Number: 12

Patient: Hi, I'm Marcus Thompson. This is my 12 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

Of course, Marcus. Setting boundaries when you're the primary caregiver can be particularly challenging. Let me share some specific steps and examples that might help you establish healthy boundaries while still being there for your mom:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with one or two specific boundaries
Example: "I need 30 minutes of uninterrupted time each evening to decompress."
- Communicate this to your family
- Set a specific time (like 7:00-7:30 PM)
- Use this time consistently for self-care

2. **Clear Communication**:
Instead of saying: "I can't handle all of this."
Try saying: "I need help with mom's medical appointments on Thursdays because I have important work commitments."

3. **Specific Requests for Help**:
- Make a list of tasks that others could help with
- Be specific about what you need
Example: "Could you stay with mom every other Saturday afternoon from 2-5 PM?"

4. **Learn to Say "No" Constructively**:
Instead of: "I can't do that right now."
Try: "I won't be able to take mom to that appointment, but I can help find someone who can."

5. **Schedule Regular Family Meetings**:
- Set up monthly check-ins with family members
- Share updates about mom's care
- Discuss challenges and needs
- Distribute responsibilities

Would you like to explore any of these strategies in more detail? Which one feels most doable to start with?

Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. Establishing boundaries as a primary caregiver is indeed a crucial step in maintaining your own well-being.

Let's start by focusing on the strategy that feels most manageable for you. Given that you mentioned starting small, perhaps we can begin with the first strategy: **Starting Small**.

### Strategy: Start Small
1. **Choose One or Two Specific Boundaries**: Let's pick one or two boundaries that feel the most pressing or impactful for you. This could be something like your need for uninterrupted time, or ensuring your mom has someone to talk to on certain days.

2. **Communicate Clearly and Assertively**: Once you've identified your boundaries, it's important to communicate them clearly and assertively. Here’s how you might do that:

   - **Example 1**: "I need 30 minutes of uninterrupted time each evening to decompress."
     - **Steps**: 
       - Set a specific time (e.g., 7:00-7:30 PM).
       - Inform your family members about this time and why it's important for you.
       - Use this time consistently for self-care activities like reading, meditating, or having a quiet conversation.

   - **Example 2**: "I need help with mom's medical appointments on Thursdays because I have important work commitments."
     - **Steps**:
       - Share your specific needs with your family.
       - Ask for their support during these times.
       - Offer to help find other family members or friends who can step in when needed.

Would you like to try one of these examples and see how it goes? Perhaps we can practice saying this to a family member during our next session. This will help you get a feel for how to communicate your needs assertively.

Which of these examples feels most doable for you to start with, or is there another boundary you’d like to explore first?

Patient: Thanks for the detailed explanation, Nova. I think starting small with the 30 minutes of uninterrupted time each evening sounds manageable. I often find myself getting caught up in work or family responsibilities until late at night, and I end up feeling drained. Setting aside that time for myself could really help me recharge.

I can see how setting a specific time, like 7:00-7:30 PM, and communicating that to my family would be important. I'll need to be clear about why this time is important for me, so they understand it's not just about me being selfish.

Do you have any tips on how to make sure I stick to this time consistently? Sometimes, I get so caught up in everything that I forget to take care of myself.

Therapist: Absolutely, Marcus, setting that time aside and sticking to it is a great start. Consistency is key, and here are a few tips to help you make sure you stick to your self-care time:

### 1. **Set Reminders**
   - **Digital Reminders**: Set an alarm or reminder on your phone at 6:30 PM to remind you to start your 30 minutes of decompression time.
   - **Calendar**: Add the time to your calendar as a recurring event so you can see it daily.

### 2. **Communicate with Your Family**
   - Inform your family about the time and explain its importance to you. Let them know you will be using this time to relax and recharge.
   - Ask them to respect this time by minimizing interruptions if possible.

### 3. **Create a Routine**
   - Establish a simple routine during this time. For example, you could use the time for meditation, reading, or even just enjoying a cup of tea.
   - Having a routine can help you feel more comfortable and less guilty about taking this time for yourself.

### 4. **Visualize the Benefits**
   - Visualize how you will feel after this time. Think about how much more energy and patience you will have if you take care of yourself.
   - This visualization can serve as a motivational reminder to stick to your schedule.

### 5. **Hold Yourself Accountable**
   - Sometimes, setting external accountability can help. Consider sharing your plan with a close friend or family member who can check in on you periodically to ensure you’re sticking to your schedule.
   - You could even set a small reward for yourself for each time you successfully stick to the schedule.

### 6. **Be Flexible**
   - If you find that an unexpected situation arises and you need to deviate from your scheduled time, try to make up for it by adding it to your next available downtime.
   - Being flexible can help you maintain your routine without feeling too rigid.

### 7. **Reflect and Adjust**
   - At the end of each week, reflect on whether you are able to maintain this time consistently. If you find it difficult, consider adjusting the time or frequency.
   - Reflecting on your progress and any challenges can help you refine your strategy.

Would you like to practice saying the boundary-setting statement with me during our next session? This will help you get more comfortable with the process and feel more confident when you communicate this to your family.

Which of these tips do you think will be most helpful for you to implement first?

Session Summary:

I understand your concern about consistency. It's very common for caregivers to put their own needs last. Here are some practical tips to help you maintain this boundary:

1. **Set a Daily Alarm**: This can serve as a reminder that it's your time. Think of it as an important appointment with yourself.

2. **Create a Ritual**: Having a specific activity or routine can help signal that this is your time. For example:
   - Making a cup of tea
   - Going to a specific room or spot
   - Putting on comfortable clothes
   - Using headphones as a visual signal to others

3. **Prepare Others in Advance**: 
   - Let your mom know ahead of time: "Mom, at 7 PM, I'll be taking my 30-minute break. I'll be back at 7:30."
   - Have something set up for her to do during this time (TV show, book, puzzle)
   - Make sure she has everything she needs before your break

4. **Start with 15 Minutes**: If 30 minutes feels too challenging at first, it's perfectly okay to start with 15 minutes and gradually increase the time.

Which of these suggestions resonates with you? And what kind of activities would you like to do during your self-care time?
