Session Number: 17

Patient: Hi, I'm Marcus Thompson. This is my 17 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

I notice you're repeating your previous response. Would you like to discuss any specific aspects of these plans in more detail? For example, we could:

1. Create a weekly schedule to help you implement these activities
2. Discuss potential challenges you might face and how to overcome them
3. Explore more specific ideas for themed movie nights or seasonal activities
4. Talk about ways to involve both your children and your mother in these activities
5. Develop strategies to maintain consistency while being flexible

What would be most helpful to focus on?

Therapist: : Hello Marcus, it's great to hear from you again. Thank you for your prompt response. Based on our previous session, let's focus on creating a weekly schedule to help you implement these activities. This can provide a clear roadmap for the coming week, making it easier to stay on track with the activities we discussed.

To start, how about we outline a simple weekly schedule? We can divide your week into segments and allocate specific times for each activity. For instance, you could plan a movie night every Friday evening, or set aside a couple of hours on Sunday afternoon for a themed activity with your children and mother.

Would you like to suggest any particular day or time for these activities? Also, do you have any specific themes in mind for the movie nights or seasonal activities that you'd like to include?

Patient: Hey Nova, good to be back. A weekly schedule sounds like a solid idea. I think setting aside specific times will definitely help me stay focused.

For movie nights, how about we make it every Friday at 7 PM? That gives me a chance to unwind after the week and bond with the kids. As for themes, maybe we can do a classic movie night where we watch old films like "The Color Purple" or "The Shawshank Redemption." My mom loves those, and it would be nice to have her join in too.

On Sundays, I was thinking of doing something seasonal. Maybe a fall-themed activity like apple picking or a visit to a local pumpkin patch. That way, we get to enjoy the season together and create some new memories. What do you think?

Therapist: : Hello Marcus, it sounds like you have some great ideas for the schedule. Let's formalize this into a structured weekly plan. Here's a proposed outline for your week:

- **Monday to Thursday:**
  - **Evenings:** Free time for work, study, or personal activities.
- **Friday:**
  - **7:00 PM:** Movie Night with the children. Theme: Classic movies like "The Color Purple" or "The Shawshank Redemption."
  - **Post-Movie:**
    - Spend quality time with your children.
    - Optionally, you could plan a light activity or game night with the children.
- **Saturday:**
  - **All Day:** Free time or other personal commitments.
- **Sunday:**
  - **10:00 AM:** Start of a seasonal activity.
    - **Fall Theme:** Apple picking or visiting a local pumpkin patch.
  - **Afternoon:**
    - Spend the afternoon enjoying the activity together.
    - Optionally, have a casual dinner with your mother.

This schedule should provide structure and ensure that you have dedicated time for both planned activities and personal commitments. It also allows for flexibility in case you need to adjust anything last minute.

How does this schedule sound to you? Do you see any potential challenges with this arrangement, or any adjustments you'd like to make?

Patient: This schedule looks pretty good, Nova. It gives me a clear idea of what to do each day, which I think will help a lot. 

One potential challenge I see is that my mom might not always be available on Sundays for the seasonal activities. She's been having some memory issues lately, so her schedule can be unpredictable. But I can always adjust and maybe involve the kids in other activities if she can't make it.

Another thing is that I might need to be flexible with the Friday movie nights. Sometimes, I get caught up with work or community stuff, and it might be hard to start at exactly 7 PM. But I'll do my best to stick to it as much as possible.

Overall, I think this plan is solid. It gives me something to look forward to and helps me balance my responsibilities better. What do you think about these potential challenges?

Therapist: : Hello Marcus, it's great to hear that you see value in this schedule and have thought through the potential challenges. Let's address those points and find some solutions to ensure you can stick to your plan as much as possible.

### Flexibility and Adjustments

1. **Sunday Seasonal Activities:**
   - **Flexibility:** You can plan a few different activities for Sundays, such as visiting a pumpkin patch, going for a hike, or having a family game day. This way, you can switch to a different activity if your mother is unavailable.
   - **Involvement of Kids:** Even if your mother can't join, you can still create meaningful activities with the kids, like cooking a special fall meal together or decorating a Halloween costume.

2. **Friday Movie Nights:**
   - **Rescheduling:** If you get caught up with work or community commitments, try to reschedule the movie night to a later time in the evening or even a different day of the week if needed.
   - **Preparation:** Consider recording your favorite movies or having a list of movies that can be watched on demand, so you can start the movie a bit later and still enjoy a quality bonding time with the family.

### Additional Strategies

1. **Communication with Your Mother:**
   - **Regular Check-Ins:** Schedule regular check-ins with your mother to ensure she knows about your plans and is aware of any changes. This can help her prepare and make sure she can join if possible.
   - **Support Network:** Consider involving other family members or friends who can help when needed. They can join in the activities or assist with planning.

2. **Staying Flexible:**
   - **Adjustable Schedule:** Your schedule is flexible, so you can adjust the times as needed. If you find that you frequently need to reschedule, consider having a backup activity or a time that works better for everyone.
   - **Prioritize Quality Time:** Focus on making the quality time you do have as meaningful and enjoyable as possible.

### Final Thoughts

Your plan is well-structured, and with some adjustments and flexibility, you can ensure that you and your family have meaningful and enjoyable experiences. Hereâ€™s a revised outline based on our discussion:

- **Monday to Thursday:**
  - **Evenings:** Free time for work, study, or personal activities.
- **Friday:**
  - **7:00 PM:** Movie Night with the children. Theme: Classic movies like "The Color Purple" or "The Shawshank Redemption."
  - **Post-Movie:**
    - Spend quality time with your children.
    - Optionally, have a light activity or game night.
- **Saturday:**
  - **All Day:** Free time or other personal commitments.
- **Sunday:**
  - **9:00 AM:** Start of a seasonal activity (e.g., apple picking or visiting a pumpkin patch).
  - **Afternoon:**.

Patient: Thanks for the detailed plan, Nova. I appreciate the flexibility and the backup activities you suggested. It really helps to have options, especially with my mom's condition.

One thing I noticed is that you mentioned recording movies or having a list of movies on demand. I actually don't have a DVR or streaming service at home. I usually rent DVDs or borrow from the library. Would it be worth considering getting a streaming service for this? It might make things easier for movie nights.

Also, I like the idea of involving other family members or friends. Maybe I could ask my sister to help out with some of the Sunday activities. She's been wanting to spend more time with the kids, and it would be good to have an extra hand.

Overall, this plan looks really good. I'll start implementing it this week and see how it goes. If anything comes up, I'll let you know. Thanks for your help, Nova.

Therapist: : You're welcome, Marcus! It's great to hear that you're excited about the plan and willing to implement it. Let's address your points to make sure everything is in place:

### Considering a Streaming Service

- **Streaming Service:** Getting a streaming service like Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime can definitely make movie nights more convenient, especially if you have a busy week. These services offer a wide variety of movies and can be rented or streamed at any time. You can also set up a family account to manage the content and allow multiple devices to stream simultaneously. This can be a cost-effective solution if you plan to use it regularly.
  
- **Cost and Setup:** If budget is a concern, you could look for a 30-day free trial offer to see if it works for you. Alternatively, you could consider sharing the cost with your sister or other family members if you decide to get a subscription.

### Involving Family and Friends

- **Involvement of Others:** Inviting your sister to help out on Sundays is a great idea. You could plan specific activities that she might enjoy, such as craft projects, outdoor games, or a cooking class. This can not only make the activities more fun but also help you manage your time more effectively.

### Final Checklist

- **Movie Nights:**
  - Consider a streaming service or DVD rentals.
  - Plan for flexibility in start times.
- **Sunday Activities:**
  - Include a mix of indoor and outdoor activities.
  - Involve your sister or other family members as needed.
  - Plan a variety of activities to keep everyone engaged and excited.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Set Up Streaming Service (if chosen):**
   - Sign up for a streaming service and start browsing for movies.
   - Create a list of family-friendly movies that everyone can enjoy.

2. **Prepare for Movie Nights:**
   - Set aside a quiet area for the movie nights.
   - Plan some post-movie activities or games to keep everyone engaged.

3. **Plan Sunday Activities:**
   - Check the local calendar for seasonal events and plan accordingly.
   - Consider involving your sister in planning and executing some of the activities.

4. **Communicate with Your Family:**
   - Share the schedule with your children and let them know what to expect.
   - Keep your mother informed about any changes or adjustments to the plans.

5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
