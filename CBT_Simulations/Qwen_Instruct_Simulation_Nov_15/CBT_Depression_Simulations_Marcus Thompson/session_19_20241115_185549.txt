Therapist: : Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again. Thank you for bringing such a comprehensive summary of our last session. It sounds like the structured weekly schedule and the involvement of your sister have been quite beneficial for the family.

Let's continue to build on these successes. Here are a few points to consider for our next steps:

1. **Refinement of the Weekly Schedule**: Let's take some time to review and refine your weekly schedule. We can ensure that all family members have input and that the activities align with everyone’s interests and needs.

2. **Tech Skills Workshop**: Planning the tech skills workshop sounds like a great idea. Perhaps we can tailor the content based on the family's needs. Would it be helpful to have a brief session where each family member can share their tech-related concerns or questions?

3. **Family Meeting**: Organizing this for this weekend is excellent. During the meeting, we can go over the upcoming schedule, discuss any challenges, and brainstorm solutions together.

4. **Monthly "Family Fun Night"**: Brainstorming for this can be fun! What are some activities or ideas that the family would enjoy together? This could be a great way to look forward to a special event each month.

5. **Weekly Check-Ins**: Starting these after dinner on Sundays is a good idea. These could be short and focused, just checking in on how everyone’s week went and any support they might need.

6. **Progress and Challenges**: Keeping notes on these will help us track our progress and make necessary adjustments. It’s also a good way to recognize when things are going well and when we might need to address any challenges more directly.

What are your thoughts on these points? Is there anything specific you would like to focus on further?

Patient: Thanks for the detailed plan, Nova. I appreciate the focus on making sure everyone's interests and needs are considered. 

1. **Refinement of the Weekly Schedule**: That sounds good. I'll make sure to ask Jamal and Aisha what they think would work best for them. 

2. **Tech Skills Workshop**: I think a brief session where everyone can share their concerns would be really helpful. Maybe we can start with something simple like setting up a shared family calendar online.

3. **Family Meeting**: This weekend sounds perfect. It'll be good to go over everything together and get everyone's input.

4. **Monthly "Family Fun Night"**: We could do something like a board game night or maybe a movie marathon. Jamal loves basketball, so maybe a trip to the local sports center. 

5. **Weekly Check-Ins**: Those after-dinner Sunday check-ins are a great idea. I'll make sure to keep them short and focused.

6. **Progress and Challenges**: I'll keep notes and we can review them during our next session. It'll be good to track how things are going and make any necessary adjustments.

I think focusing on the tech skills workshop and family fun night ideas would be particularly helpful for us right now.
