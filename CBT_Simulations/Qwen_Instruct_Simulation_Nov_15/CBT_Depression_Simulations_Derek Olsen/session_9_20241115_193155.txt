Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again. It sounds like we're making progress with the techniques we've been working on, and I'm glad to hear that the 4-7-8 breathing technique and the 15-minute rule have been helpful for you. Let's continue to build on these successes.

From what you've shared, it seems like your financial stress and concerns about supporting your children remain significant sources of anxiety. It's important to acknowledge how these feelings can be overwhelming, but it's also good to see that you're open to trying new techniques to manage these stresses.

This session, we can focus on how to integrate the body scan and guided meditation techniques more effectively into your daily routine, especially when you're dealing with financial concerns. I also want to ensure that we're addressing these larger issues in a way that feels manageable and less overwhelming.

Let's talk about any specific scenarios or situations where these financial concerns arise, and how we might use the techniques we've learned to help you cope. We can also explore additional strategies or resources that might be useful in these situations.

For your homework this week, I'd like you to try the body scan meditation technique at different times and in different settings. This will help you see how it fits into your daily life and what works best for you. Additionally, continue using the 15-minute rule to tackle smaller tasks, and try to notice how this affects your overall sense of control and anxiety levels.

What do you think about adding a short relaxation break during the day, perhaps after lunch or before an evening activity, to practice your body scan or 4-7-8 breathing? This could be a good opportunity to recharge and manage stress before facing more challenging situations.

Let's discuss any specific financial concerns or scenarios that you might want to practice these techniques on. This will help us tailor the strategies to better fit your needs.

Patient: Yeah, the breathing and 15-minute rule have helped some. But the big stuff, like the bills and not being able to help my kids, it still feels like a mountain. I tried the body scan thing last night, but I don't know, it felt kinda weird. Like I was just lying there, not really feeling any different. Maybe I'm doing it wrong?

I guess a short break during the day could help. Maybe after lunch, like you said. I could use a breather before the afternoon drags on. But I'm not sure how that's gonna fix the money problems. I mean, I get that it's supposed to help me handle the stress better, but it's not gonna pay the rent, you know?

The worst part is when I think about my kids. Emma's been calling less, and Jake, well, he's got his own family now. I can't even help them out like I used to. That's what really gets to me. I don't know how to use these techniques to deal with that kind of stuff. It's not like I can just breathe my way out of feeling like a failure as a dad.

Therapist: Hello Derek, thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me. It's understandable that you might feel like these techniques are not enough to address your financial and personal concerns, especially when they are so deeply rooted in your sense of identity and self-worth. Let's break it down a bit further to see how we can make these strategies more effective for you.

### Acknowledgment and Validation
First, I want to acknowledge the difficulty you're facing with your financial situation and the feelings of inadequacy when it comes to supporting your children. These are valid concerns, and they're a testament to the strength and love you have for them. It's important to validate these feelings, as they can be overwhelming.

### Integrating Relaxation Techniques
Let's delve into how you can integrate the relaxation techniques more effectively. The body scan meditation, in particular, might require some time to get comfortable with. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Consistency**: Try to practice the body scan every day, even if it's just for a few minutes. Consistency can help you become more familiar with the process.
2. **Guided Practice**: Using a guided body scan meditation might help. There are many free resources available online, such as apps or YouTube videos. This can provide you with structure and guidance, which might help you feel more comfortable with the process.
3. **Mindfulness in Daily Activities**: You can also try incorporating mindfulness into everyday activities. For example, when you're eating lunch, pay close attention to the taste, texture, and sensation of each bite. This can help you bring your focus away from worries and onto the present moment.

### Addressing Financial Stress
Addressing financial stress directly can be a bit more structured. Here are a few steps you might consider:

1. **Budgeting and Planning**: Break down your financial goals into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, set a goal to save a certain amount each month or week. Use tools like a budget planner to track your expenses and income.
2. **Communication**: Reach out to family members for support. Sometimes, sharing your struggles can help you feel less alone and may uncover resources you hadn't considered.
3. **Professional Help**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor or a support group. These professionals can offer practical strategies and emotional support.

### Coping with Feelings of Failure
Dealing with feelings of failure is a common challenge, especially when you're facing significant life pressures. Here are a few ways to address this:

1. **Reframe Thoughts**: Challenge any negative self-talk by reframing your thoughts. For example, instead of thinking, "I'm a failure as a dad," try, "I'm doing my best with the resources I have."
2. **Set Realistic Goals**: Focus on setting and achieving small, realistic goals. Each small victory can help build your confidence and resilience.
3. **Connect with Others**:.

Patient: Yeah, I get what you're saying about consistency and guided practice. Maybe I'll try those apps or videos. I can see how that might help me get the hang of it. But I gotta be honest, the financial stuff, it's like a black hole. I've tried budgeting before, but it never seems to stick. I guess I could give it another shot, but it feels like I'm just spinning my wheels.

And the feelings of failure, that's the real kicker. I mean, I know I'm not perfect, but when I think about how I used to be able to provide and now I can't even help my kids with a few bucks, it just eats at me. I don't know how to reframe that. It's not like I can just tell myself I'm doing my best and feel better about it. It's hard to see the small victories when the big picture looks so bleak.

I'll try the mindfulness thing during lunch. Maybe that'll help me get through the day without feeling like I'm just waiting for the next bad thing to happen. But I need more than just breathing and mindfulness to tackle the real problems. I need to figure out how to get back on my feet, financially and otherwise.

Therapist: : I understand how challenging it must feel, Derek, and I'm here to support you through this. Let's break down a few steps to address the financial stress and the feelings of failure more effectively. We can build on the techniques we've already discussed and explore additional strategies to help you feel more empowered.

### Addressing Financial Stress

1. **Budgeting and Planning**:
   - **Set Specific Goals**: Break down your financial goals into smaller, achievable steps. For example, aim to save a specific amount each week or month. Use a budgeting app or tool to track your expenses and income.
   - **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your budget and make adjustments as needed. This can help you stay on track and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
   - **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor or counselor who can provide personalized advice and support.

2. **Communication and Support**:
   - **Talk to Family Members**: Share your struggles and ask for support. Sometimes, family members might be willing to help or provide resources you didn't realize were available.
   - **Community Resources**: Look into local community resources, such as food banks, utility assistance, or financial aid programs. These can provide temporary relief and support.

3. **Debt Management**:
   - **Prioritize Debts**: If you have multiple debts, prioritize them based on interest rates or due dates. Focus on paying off high-interest debts first.
   - **Consolidate Debts**: Consider consolidating debts into a single, lower-interest loan to simplify repayment and reduce stress.

### Coping with Feelings of Failure

1. **Reframing Thoughts**:
   - **Challenge Negative Self-Talk**: When you find yourself thinking negative thoughts, challenge them by asking yourself if they are true or if there's another way to view the situation. For example, instead of thinking "I'm a failure as a dad," consider "I'm doing the best I can with what I have."
   - **Practice Gratitude**: Focus on the positive aspects of your life and relationships. Keeping a gratitude journal can help shift your perspective.

2. **Building Resilience**:
   - **Celebrate Small Victories**: Acknowledge and celebrate every small achievement, no matter how insignificant it may seem. This can help build your confidence and resilience.
   - **Set Realistic Goals**: Set goals that are achievable and celebrate each step towards them. This can help you feel more in control and motivated.

3. **Mindfulness and Relaxation**:
   - **Incorporate Mindfulness During Daily Activities**: Use mindfulness to stay present and reduce stress. For example, focus on the sensations of eating, walking, or breathing during daily activities.
   - **Short Relaxation Breaks**: Continue to practice short relaxation breaks, such as the 4-7-8 breathing technique or guided meditation. These can help you manage stress and improve your overall well-being.

###.

Patient: Alright, I get what you're saying about breaking down the financial stuff into smaller steps. I'll try setting specific goals and using a budgeting app. I guess it's worth a shot, even if it feels like I've tried it all before.

As for the feelings of failure, I'll give that reframe thing a try. Maybe writing down some positive thoughts in a journal could help. I never thought about keeping a gratitude journal, but I can see how that might shift my focus a bit.

I'll also keep up with the mindfulness during lunch and those short relaxation breaks. It's not gonna fix everything overnight, but if it helps me get through the day without feeling like I'm drowning, then it's worth it.

I guess what I need most is a plan that feels doable. Something that gives me a sense of control, even if it's just over a small part of my life. I'll try these steps and see how it goes. Thanks for the advice, Nova.

Therapist: : You're welcome, Derek. I'm glad to hear that you're willing to give these steps a try. Remember, making progress often feels small and incremental, and that's perfectly okay. Here are a few additional tips to help you stay on track and feel more in control:

1. **Create a Routine**: Establish a routine for practicing relaxation techniques and budgeting. This can make the process more manageable and consistent.
2. **Track Your Progress**: Keep a log or journal to track your financial goals and small victories. Seeing progress, no matter how small, can be incredibly motivating.
3. **Support Network**: Build a support network of friends, family, or community resources that can offer encouragement and practical help when needed.
4. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. Recognize that overcoming financial stress and feelings of failure takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. Each step forward is progress.

Let's plan your next steps together. For your next session, we can go over your progress, discuss any challenges you faced, and adjust your plan as needed. This will ensure that you feel supported and that the strategies we're implementing are working for you.

1. **Budgeting and Planning**:
   - Set specific financial goals and use a budgeting app to track your expenses and income.
   - Regularly review and adjust your budget.

2. **Communication and Support**:
