Session Number: 15

Patient: Hi, I'm Derek Olsen. This is my 15 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

Yes, that's exactly right, Derek! You've got a good grasp of the basic concepts. Let me confirm your understanding and add a few practical tips to help you get started:

### Thought Records

Your understanding is spot-on. To make it even more practical:
- Keep a small notebook handy or use your phone to jot down thoughts when they occur
- Start with one or two situations per day
- Don't worry about getting it perfect - just write what comes to mind
- Try to be as specific as possible when describing situations and thoughts

### Mindfulness Practice

You've got the basics right. To make it more manageable:
- Start with just 3 minutes per day
- Pick a specific time (like right after waking up or before bed)
- If your mind wanders, that's normal - just gently bring your attention back to your breath
- Don't judge yourself if you miss a day or find it difficult

Would you like to try a quick practice of either technique right now? We could walk through a thought record together or do a brief mindfulness exercise to make sure you're comfortable with how it works.

What would be most helpful for you?

Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again. I'm glad to hear that you remember our last session well. Let's dive right into continuing your practice with some additional tips.

### Thought Records

To enhance your thought records, here are a few more steps you can take:

1. **Identify Triggers**: Before you start writing, take a moment to think about what triggered your thoughts. Was it a specific event, a conversation, or a particular emotion?
2. **Evaluate Evidence**: After writing down your thoughts, try to evaluate the evidence for and against them. Is there any objective data that contradicts what you're telling yourself?
3. **Challenge Irrational Thoughts**: Practice challenging those thoughts by asking yourself if they are based on facts or if they are exaggerated or distorted. Use a questioning approach like "Is this thought helpful? Is there a more realistic interpretation?"

### Mindfulness Practice

Let's refine your mindfulness practice a bit more:

1. **Daily Consistency**: Consistency is key. Try to do your mindfulness practice at the same time each day to make it a habit.
2. **Guided Practices**: If you find it challenging, you might want to start with a guided mindfulness audio. There are many free resources online that can help guide you through the process.
3. **Body Scan**: Sometimes focusing on different parts of your body can help you stay present. You can do a simple body scan where you focus on each part of your body, starting from your toes and moving up to the top of your head.

Would you like to practice a thought record or a short mindfulness exercise now? This will help solidify the techniques and ensure you feel comfortable using them.

Which would you prefer?

Patient: Alright, let's go with the thought record. I'm still not entirely sure how to do this, so if you could walk me through it, that'd be great. I had a rough morning today. I woke up feeling like I couldn't get out of bed, thinking about how useless I am and how I'm just a burden to everyone. That's what I want to work on.

Therapist: : That's a great choice, Derek. Let's go through a thought record step-by-step to help you identify and challenge these thoughts. I'll guide you through each part to make sure you're comfortable with the process.

### Step 1: Describe the Situation
First, let's describe the situation that triggered your thoughts. You mentioned feeling like you couldn't get out of bed, thinking you were useless and a burden to everyone. Can you pinpoint a specific event or time of day that led to these thoughts?

### Step 2: Write Down Your Thoughts
Next, let's write down the specific thoughts you had during this situation. Try to be as detailed as possible. What exactly did you think?

### Step 3: Evaluate the Evidence
Now, let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. For example, if you think you are useless, can you find any evidence that contradicts this? Maybe you've achieved something recently or have done something kind for someone else. It's important to look at both sides.

### Step 4: Challenge Irrational Thoughts
Finally, let's challenge those irrational thoughts. Ask yourself questions that might help you reframe your thoughts more positively. For example:
- Is it true that I am useless?
- Are there any situations where I have been helpful or successful?
- Is it helpful to think of myself as a burden? Could there be a more balanced way of looking at this?

Let's go through these steps together:

1. **Describe the Situation**: You woke up in the morning, feeling very low and having thoughts that you were useless and a burden to everyone.
2. **Write Down Your Thoughts**: You thought, "I can't get out of bed, I'm such a burden, everyone would be better off without me."
3. **Evaluate the Evidence**:
   - Evidence for: "I can't get out of bed, I'm feeling so down."
   - Evidence against: "I have done things for people in the past, I have skills that are useful, and my friends/family care about me."
4. **Challenge Irrational Thoughts**:
   - "I can't get out of bed" - Is it true that you can't get out of bed? Do you always struggle to get up, or is this a rare occurrence?
   - "I'm such a burden" - Can you think of any specific situations where you've been helpful or supportive to others? How do your friends and family feel about you?
   - "Everyone would be better off without me" - Have you ever heard someone say they wish you weren't around? Do you have any evidence that supports this thought?

Would you like to work through these steps together, or would you prefer to do it on your own?

Patient: Alright, let's work through these steps together. I'll try to be as honest as I can.

1. **Describe the Situation**: I woke up this morning, and the first thing I thought about was how much pain I was in from my back. Then I started thinking about how I can't work anymore, and that led to feeling like I'm just a burden to everyone.

2. **Write Down Your Thoughts**: I thought, "I can't get out of bed because of the pain, and even if I could, what's the point? I'm just a burden to my kids and everyone else. They'd be better off without me."

3. **Evaluate the Evidence**:
   - Evidence for: "I can't get out of bed because of the pain, and I feel like a burden because I can't contribute financially or help out around the house."
   - Evidence against: "I used to be a skilled construction worker, and I know my kids still care about me even if we don't talk as much now. I've done things for them in the past, like helping with home repairs."

4. **Challenge Irrational Thoughts**:
   - "I can't get out of bed" - It's true that I can't get out of bed because of the pain, but it's not every day that

Therapist: : That's a good start, Derek. Let's continue breaking down and challenging those thoughts.

### Step 4: Challenge Irrational Thoughts

Let's dive into challenging those irrational thoughts in more detail:

1. **"I can't get out of bed because of the pain, and I feel like a burden because I can't contribute financially or help out around the house."**

   - **"I can't get out of bed"**: While it's true that the pain makes it difficult, can you identify if there are days when you can get up without much issue? Sometimes, even just getting up can be a small victory. Additionally, consider that physical pain is temporary, and you can focus on recovery and managing your pain.

   - **"I feel like a burden because I can't contribute financially or help out around the house."**: It's important to recognize that there are many ways to contribute beyond financial and physical support. You mentioned doing home repairs, which is valuable. Think about other ways you can help, such as planning meals, offering emotional support, or providing care for your children in other ways when you're feeling better. Also, consider that your kids and family value you for more than just what you can do—your presence and the love you give matter deeply.

2. **"I'm just a burden to my kids and everyone else. They'd be better off without me."**

   - **"They'd be better off without me"**: Reflect on the relationship you have with your family. Do they express that they wish you weren't around? Often, people worry they're a burden without others expressing it. Have you ever heard someone say they wish you weren't around? If not, consider that your family likely cares deeply about you.

   - **"I'm just a burden"**: Try to reframe this thought. Instead of focusing on what you can't do, focus on what you can. Even small acts of kindness or showing your love can make a big difference. Additionally, consider that everyone faces challenges and needs support sometimes, and that’s okay.

### Summary

1. **Describe the Situation**: You woke up this morning, feeling pain from your back, which led to thoughts of not being able to get out of bed and feeling like a burden because you can’t contribute financially or help out around the house.
2. **Write Down Your Thoughts**: "I can't get out of bed because of the pain, and even if I could, what's the point? I'm just a burden to my kids and everyone else. They'd be better off without me."
3. **Evaluate the Evidence**:
   - **Evidence for**: "I can't get out of bed because of the pain, and I feel like a burden because I can't contribute financially or help out around the house."
   - **Evidence against**: "I used to be a skilled construction worker, and I know my kids still care about.

Patient: I appreciate you walking me through this, but I gotta say, it feels like a lot of work just to convince myself that I'm not completely useless. I mean, I know my kids care about me, but they're busy with their own lives. And sure, I used to be good at my job, but that was a long time ago. I can't do that anymore, and it's hard to see any other way I can contribute.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, even if I can challenge these thoughts, it doesn't change the fact that I'm in pain and I can't do the things I used to do. It's frustrating, and sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, I'm just stuck in this rut.

Therapist: : I understand how you feel, Derek. It can be incredibly challenging to navigate these feelings, especially when physical pain and a sense of helplessness are involved. It's important to acknowledge that these thoughts are a reflection of your current circumstances and emotions, and it's okay to feel that way. However, there are steps you can take to make things more manageable and to start feeling more hopeful.

### Addressing the Challenges

1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It's crucial to recognize that your feelings of being a burden and the frustration you're experiencing are valid. You're in a difficult situation, and it's natural to feel stuck. Acknowledging your emotions can help you start to process them more effectively.

2. **Small Steps for Contribution**: Even if you feel you can't do much, there are small steps you can take to contribute in meaningful ways:
   - **Emotional Support**: You can offer emotional support to your family. Small acts of kindness, like sending a message to check in or helping with small tasks when you can.
   - **Physical Contributions**: Even if it's just for short periods, help with household tasks when you feel up to it. Every bit helps.
   - **Planning and Organization**: Help plan meals or organize household chores. These are valuable contributions even if you can’t do them all yourself.

3. **Professional Support**: Sometimes, speaking to a professional can provide additional strategies and support. Consider discussing your feelings and the challenges you're facing with a counselor or therapist who can provide tailored guidance.

4. **Pain Management**: Work with your healthcare provider to explore pain management options. This might include physical therapy, medication, or other treatments that can help you manage your pain more effectively.

### Mindfulness and Acceptance

In addition to challenging your thoughts, practicing mindfulness can help you accept your current situation without judgment. Mindfulness can be a tool to help you stay present and focus on the here and now, rather than getting caught up in worries about the future or past.

### Practical Exercise

Let's try a brief mindfulness exercise to help you stay grounded in the present moment. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. When your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your breath.

Take a few minutes to practice this, and if you find it helpful, try to do this exercise a few times a day.

Would you like to give this mindfulness exercise a try now, or would you prefer to practice it later?

Patient: Alright, I'll give that mindfulness exercise a try now. I'll close my eyes and focus on my breath. Here goes nothing.

*closes eyes and takes a deep breath in through the nose, holds it for a few seconds, and then exhales slowly through the mouth*

Okay, I did that a few times. It's not bad, I guess. It's hard to keep my mind from wandering, though. It keeps going back to all the things I can't do and how much everything sucks. But I'll try to do this a few times a day and see if it helps.

Therapist: : Thank you for taking the time to try the mindfulness exercise, Derek. It's completely normal for your mind to wander, especially when dealing with challenging emotions and circumstances. The key is to gently bring your focus back to your breath whenever your thoughts start to drift.

### Mindfulness Practice

Here’s a simple guide to help you stay on track:

1. **Find a Quiet Space**: Ensure you're in a quiet and comfortable place where you won't be disturbed.
2. **Set a Timer**: Start with just 3-5 minutes. As you get more comfortable, you can increase the duration.
3. **Close Your Eyes**: Close your eyes gently and bring your attention to your breath.
4. **Breathe Deeply**: Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth.
5. **Focus on the Breath**: Pay attention to the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body. Notice any physical sensations, such as the rise and fall of your chest or the movement of your abdomen.
6. **Gently Notice Wandering Thoughts**: When your mind starts to wander, acknowledge the thought without judgment and return your focus to your breath.

### Additional Tips

- **Use Guided Practices**: If you find it difficult, you might want to try a guided mindfulness practice. There are many apps and online resources that offer guided sessions.
- **Combine with Activities**: Incorporate mindfulness into daily activities. For example, when you're brushing your teeth, focus solely on the sensation of the toothbrush on your teeth and the taste of the toothpaste.
- **Keep It Consistent**: Try to do your mindfulness practice at the same time each day to make it a habit. This can help you build a routine and make it easier to focus.

### Moving Forward

Let's summarize what you’ve done today:

1. **Identified the Situation and Thoughts**: You described your feelings of being a burden and the frustration you're experiencing.
2. **Challenged Irrational Thoughts**: We looked at evidence both for and against these thoughts and challenged them by focusing on your past contributions and your family's feelings toward you.
3. **Practiced Mindfulness**: You tried a brief mindfulness exercise and found it helpful, even if your mind wandered.

### Next Steps

- **Continue with Mindfulness**: Try to practice mindfulness a few times a day. Start with 3-5 minutes and gradually increase the duration.
- **Small Contributions**: Look for small ways to contribute at home and show emotional support.
- **Professional Support**: Consider speaking to a therapist if you find these feelings overwhelming.

Would you like to set a goal for the next few days or do you have any other questions about today's session?

Patient: Alright, I'll keep practicing the mindfulness exercises and try to find small ways to contribute around the house. I'll also think about talking to a therapist if things get too overwhelming.

For now, I think my goal for the next few days is to do the mindfulness practice at least twice a day and see if I can help out with one small task each day, even if it's just something simple.

Anything else we need to cover today, or can we wrap this up?

Therapist: : That sounds like a great plan, Derek. It's important to set achievable goals that can help you build momentum. Here’s a quick summary of our plan:

1. **Mindfulness Practice**: Aim to do the exercise at least twice a day, starting with 3-5 minutes and gradually increasing as you feel more comfortable.
2. **Small Contributions**: Try to help out with one small task each day. Even simple tasks can make a difference.
3. **Professional Support**: Consider speaking to a therapist if things become overwhelming.

### Additional Tips for Mindfulness

- **Consistency**: Try to do your mindfulness practice at the same time each day to make it a habit.
- **Guided Practices**: Use guided mindfulness exercises to help you stay focused if you find it challenging to do it on your own.

### Next Steps

- **Weekly Check-Ins**: We can plan to have a short check-in next week to see how you're doing and make any necessary adjustments to your plan.
- **Support System**: Continue to lean on your family and friends for support. Sometimes, just sharing your feelings with someone can provide a lot of relief.

### Final Thoughts

It's important to be gentle with yourself and recognize that progress takes time. You're taking important steps toward managing your thoughts and feelings more effectively. Keep practicing, and remember that each small step forward is significant.

Let's wrap this up for now. If you have any questions or need further guidance in the meantime, feel free to reach out. Take care, Derek.

Have a good day, and I look forward to our next session.
