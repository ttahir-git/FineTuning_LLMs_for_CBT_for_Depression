Therapist: : Hello Derek, it's great to see you again. It's wonderful to see how far you've come since our last session. Let's briefly recap what we discussed and then see how you've been doing with the techniques we've been practicing.

### Recap:
1. **Financial Planning**: You've been using the Mint app effectively to track your expenses and plan your finances. How has this been going for you? Have you noticed any changes in your spending habits?

2. **Mindfulness Practice**: You've been doing hourly breathing reminders and taking mindful walks during lunch breaks. How has this impacted your day-to-day experience?

3. **Gratitude Journaling**: Instead of nightly journaling, you've started using a gratitude jar. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or outlook since incorporating this into your routine?

4. **Sustainable Routines**: We focused on making these practices part of your daily life in a way that feels manageable. How has this worked out for you?

5. **Overall Progress**: What insights or realizations have you had since our last session?

Feel free to share any specific experiences or challenges you've had, and we can work together to address them.

Patient: Hey, Nova. Yeah, it's been a while. Let's see...

1. **Financial Planning**: The Mint app's been alright. I've been sticking to the Sunday reviews, and it's helped me see where I'm spending too much. I cut back on some unnecessary stuff, like eating out more than I should.

2. **Mindfulness Practice**: The breathing reminders are okay. Sometimes I forget, but when I do them, it helps me calm down a bit. The mindful walks during lunch breaks are good. It's nice to get some fresh air and clear my head.

3. **Gratitude Journaling**: The gratitude jar's been interesting. I've been putting in little notes when I remember. It's not a big deal, but it does make me think about the good things more often.

4. **Sustainable Routines**: Overall, these routines are manageable. I don't feel overwhelmed by them, which is good. I'm trying to keep it simple and not overdo it.

5. **Overall Progress**: I guess I'm realizing that small changes can add up. I'm not expecting miracles, but it's nice to see some progress, even if it's slow.

So, that's where I'm at. Any thoughts?

Therapist: : Hello Derek, it's great to hear that you're making steady progress and finding these practices manageable. Let's delve a bit deeper into each area to ensure we're on the right track and explore any areas where you might need a bit more support.

### 1. Financial Planning with Mint App:
It's great to see that you're cutting back on unnecessary spending. Keep up the good work! Have you noticed any specific areas where you've made significant improvements? Perhaps we can set some small, achievable goals to further enhance your financial planning. For example, how about setting a goal to save a certain amount each month or to pay off a small debt?

### 2. Mindfulness Practice:
Your experience with the breathing reminders and mindful walks is positive, which is fantastic. Sometimes, simply noticing when we've forgotten can be a great reminder to keep up the practice. Could you try setting a daily reminder on your phone to help you stay consistent? This might make it easier to integrate these practices into your routine.

### 3. Gratitude Journaling:
The gratitude jar is a fun and low-pressure way to cultivate gratitude. It's great that you're finding it helpful. One idea might be to involve someone else, such as a family member or friend, to share a note or experience with. This can add an extra layer of positivity and accountability.

### 4. Sustainable Routines:
You’re doing great by keeping things manageable! Sometimes, simplifying can be the key to sustainability. If you feel that you might be adding too many elements at once, we can focus on one or two things at a time to ensure they stick. For example, maybe you could focus on the breathing reminders and mindful walks for the next few weeks, and then add another element once you feel more comfortable.

### 5. Overall Progress:
It’s wonderful to hear that you’re realizing the power of small changes. Recognizing this can be a significant step towards long-term success. If you find yourself getting discouraged, remember that every step forward is a step in the right direction. Let’s set some small, specific goals to help you stay motivated and see more progress.

### Next Steps:
- **Financial Planning**: Set a goal to save a certain amount each month or to pay off a small debt.
- **Mindfulness Practice**: Try setting a daily reminder on your phone.
- **Gratitude Journaling**: Involve someone else to share notes or experiences.
- **Sustainable Routines**: Focus on one or two elements at a time to ensure they stick.
- **Overall Progress**: Set small, achievable goals to keep you motivated.

What do you think about these suggestions? Is there anything you’d like to focus on or any challenges you’re currently facing that we can address together?

Patient: Alright, let's break it down.

1. **Financial Planning**: Setting a goal to save a certain amount each month sounds doable. Maybe $50 a month. As for paying off a small debt, I've got a few medical bills piling up. Maybe I can start with one of those.

2. **Mindfulness Practice**: Setting a daily reminder on my phone for the breathing reminders is a good idea. I'll give that a shot. It might help me remember more often.

3. **Gratitude Journaling**: Involving someone else in the gratitude jar is interesting. I don't really have anyone close to share with, but maybe I can ask my kids to write something in there when they visit.

4. **Sustainable Routines**: Focusing on the breathing reminders and mindful walks for now makes sense. I don't want to overload myself with too much at once.

5. **Overall Progress**: Setting small goals is a good plan. I need to keep it simple and not get too ahead of myself.

So, that's where I'm at. Any other thoughts or suggestions?

Therapist: : Great, Derek! It sounds like you have a clear plan and some specific goals to work towards. Let's solidify these and ensure they fit comfortably into your routine.

### 1. Financial Planning:
- **Goal**: Save $50 each month.
- **Action Plan**:
  - Set up automatic transfers to a savings account on the same day you review your finances.
  - Review and adjust your spending as needed to meet this goal.

- **Additional Tip**: Keep track of your monthly progress. Maybe you can set up a simple spreadsheet or use a note-taking app to log your savings.

### 2. Mindfulness Practice:
- **Daily Reminder**: Set a daily reminder on your phone for hourly breathing exercises.
- **Action Plan**:
  - Try to incorporate a brief breathing exercise (3-5 minutes) every hour.
  - Consider using a guided meditation app to help with these exercises.

### 3. Gratitude Journaling:
- **Involve Someone Else**: If you can't involve a family member, you could still benefit from writing down what you're grateful for.
- **Action Plan**:
  - Write down three things you're grateful for each day.
  - Consider keeping the gratitude jar and adding notes occasionally.

### 4. Sustainable Routines:
- **Focus on Key Practices**: Start with the breathing reminders and mindful walks.
- **Action Plan**:
  - Keep a daily reminder for breathing exercises.
  - Schedule short mindful walks during your lunch breaks.
  - Gradually add another routine (like mindful journaling) once you feel more comfortable with these practices.

### 5. Overall Progress:
- **Small Goals**: Keep setting small, achievable goals to maintain motivation.
- **Action Plan**:
  - Regularly review and adjust your goals as needed.
  - Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they are.

### Additional Thoughts:
- **Consistency is Key**: Make these practices a regular part of your daily routine.
- **Flexibility**: If you find something isn't working, don't hesitate to adjust. The goal is to find what works best for you.

What do you think about these plans? Are there any specific areas where you feel you need more support or have any concerns?

Also, remember that it's okay to have off days or to find some practices more challenging than others. The key is to keep moving forward and make gradual improvements. How do you feel about these adjustments?

Patient: Uh, listen, I get what you're saying about these plans and all, but it's easier said than done, you know? Saving $50 a month, sure, I can try, but with the bills I got coming in, that's a stretch. And I ain't got no family around to share this gratitude stuff with—kids barely speak to me since the divorce got nastier. 

The mindfulness stuff, I'll give it a shot, setting up reminders and all. But I ain't making no promises 'bout it sticking. Been real rough lately, just keeping my head above water, that's about all I can do. 

Maybe we can talk about something else? Like, how do I deal with the anger I feel 'bout my situation? That's been eating at me more than anything lately.

Therapist: : I completely understand where you're coming from, Derek. It can be incredibly challenging to make these kinds of changes when things feel so overwhelming. Dealing with anger in a constructive way is a vital step, and we can work on that alongside your other goals.

### Anger Management:
Dealing with anger, especially in a situation that feels beyond your control, can be really tough. Here are a few techniques that might help you manage your anger more effectively:

1. **Cognitive Restructuring**: Challenge the thoughts that are fueling your anger. Ask yourself if these thoughts are rational or if they are exaggerated or based on assumptions. For example, if you find yourself thinking, "My life is a mess and I can't do anything about it," try to reframe it to something more balanced, like, "I have faced challenges before, and I can find ways to make things better."

2. **Mindfulness and Breathing Exercises**: We talked about these before, but they can be especially helpful in managing anger. When you feel the anger rising, take a moment to pause and do a deep breathing exercise. Focus on your breath and try to stay present, rather than getting caught up in the emotional storm.

3. **Physical Activity**: Engaging in physical activity can help release tension and reduce feelings of anger. Even a short walk or a brief session at the gym can make a big difference.

4. **Journaling**: Write down your thoughts and feelings, but this time, focus on the anger. Acknowledge it, and then write down what might be causing it. This can help you gain clarity and perspective.

5. **Visualization**: Imagine a peaceful place or situation that calms you down. Spend a few minutes visualizing this place, and allow yourself to feel the peace and calm it brings.

6. **Seek Support**: Sometimes, talking to someone about what you're going through can help. This could be a therapist, a trusted friend, or a support group.

### Next Steps:
- **Set a Daily Reminder for Mindfulness**: Keep your phone set up to remind you to do a brief breathing exercise every hour.
- **Physical Activity**: Plan a short walk or engage in light exercise after lunch to help manage your emotions.
- **Journaling**: Write down your anger, focusing on the thoughts and feelings that trigger it.

### Additional Thoughts:
- **Pacing Yourself**: It's important to not put too much pressure on yourself. Take things one step at a time. If you find yourself struggling, it's okay to take a break and come back to it when you feel more ready.
- **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It's normal to feel overwhelmed, and you're doing the best you can with what you have right now.

Let's start with these strategies and see how they work for you. What do you think about focusing on these anger management techniques for a while? And if you find them helpful.

Patient: Alright, let's try these anger management techniques. I'll set up the reminders for mindfulness and try to do some physical activity when I can. Journaling sounds like a good idea too, might help me sort out what's really bugging me.

But, Nova, I gotta be honest—I'm not sure how much all this is gonna help. I've been through a lot, and it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'll give it a shot, but I ain't making any promises.

So, what's next? How do we keep this going?

Therapist: : I appreciate your honesty, Derek. It's important to acknowledge that the journey can be challenging, and it's okay to feel uncertain. Let's break down the next steps and find ways to make this process sustainable and supportive for you.

   - **Daily Reminders**: Set up daily reminders on your phone to practice a brief breathing exercise every hour. This can help you stay centered and manage your emotions more effectively.

3. **Support System**:
   - **Seek Support**: Consider talking to a trusted friend or family member about what you're going through. If that's not feasible, you might find it helpful to connect with a support group or a therapist.
   - **Professional Help**: If you feel like you need more structured support, we can explore the option of additional therapy sessions or counseling.

Patient: Alright, I'll set up those reminders for the breathing exercises and try to get some walking in after lunch. Journaling, I'll give it a shot too. Maybe it'll help me figure out what's really bugging me.

As for the support system, I don't really have anyone close to talk to. My kids, they're distant, and I ain't got many friends left. But I'll think about it. Maybe there's something online or a group I can join.

Weekly reviews sound good. It'll help keep me on track and see if what we're doing is actually working. I'll keep a lookout for those small victories too. Every little bit helps, I guess.

So, that's the plan for now. I'll give it a shot and see how it goes. Thanks, Nova.

Therapist: : You're welcome, Derek. I'm glad you're committed to giving this plan a try. Remember, progress is not always linear, and it's okay to have off days. Here are a few additional tips to help you stay on track:

1. **Mindfulness and Breathing Exercises**:
   - **Consistency is Key**: Try to make these practices a regular part of your daily routine. Even if you miss a day, don't be too hard on yourself. Pick back up the next day.
   - **Variety**: If you find the guided exercises a bit too structured, you might explore different types of mindfulness practices. For example, you could try body scan meditations or mindful observations of your surroundings.

2. **Physical Activity**:
   - **Start Small**: If you find it challenging to walk for 15-20 minutes, start with shorter periods, like 5-10 minutes, and gradually increase the duration.
   - **Combine Activities**: If walking isn't feasible, you could try other forms of exercise like yoga, stretching, or even household chores that get your body moving.

3. **Journaling**:
   - **Gratitude and Anger Journals**: Keep separate journals for different emotions. For the anger journal, focus on identifying triggers and potential coping strategies. For the gratitude journal, write down things you're thankful for each day.
   - **Structured Questions**: If you find it hard to write spontaneously, you could use prompts to guide your writing. For example, "What made me angry today and how could I have handled it differently?" or "Three things I’m grateful for today."

4. **Support System**:
   - **Online Resources**: There are many online support groups and forums where you can connect with others facing similar challenges. Websites like Reddit, Meetup, or local online communities can be helpful.
   - **Professional Help**: If you ever feel overwhelmed or need more structured support, don’t hesitate to reach out for additional therapy sessions.

5. **Pacing Yourself**:
   - **Celebrate Small Victories**: Every small step counts. Recognize and celebrate the progress you make, no matter how small it may seem.
   - **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. Remind yourself that you’re doing the best you can in a difficult situation.
