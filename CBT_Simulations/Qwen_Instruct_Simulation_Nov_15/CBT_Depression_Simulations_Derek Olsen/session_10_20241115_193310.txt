Session Number: 10

Patient: Hi, I'm Derek Olsen. This is my 10 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

Thank you for being open to trying these strategies, Derek. You're right - having a plan that feels doable is crucial. Let's make sure you leave today with some concrete steps.

For this week, I'd like you to focus on three main things:

1. **Financial Planning**
- Download a budgeting app (I can recommend some if you'd like)
- Start tracking your daily expenses, no matter how small
- Set one specific, achievable financial goal for the week

2. **Mindfulness Practice**
- Continue with the lunch break mindfulness
- Try the guided body scan meditation using an app (aim for 5-10 minutes)
- Use the 4-7-8 breathing whenever you feel overwhelmed

3. **Gratitude/Journaling**
- Write down one thing you're grateful for each day
- Note any small victories or accomplishments, no matter how minor they seem

Would you like to schedule our next session for the same time next week? We can review how these strategies worked for you and adjust them as needed.

Remember, you're taking positive steps forward, even if they feel small right now. How does this plan sound to you?

Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again. I'm glad to hear that you're ready to move forward with your plan. Here’s a summary of our conversation and the plan we discussed:

1. **Financial Planning**
   - **Action Steps**: Download a budgeting app (I can recommend some options if you'd like) and start tracking your daily expenses. Focus on at least one specific, achievable financial goal for the week.

2. **Mindfulness Practice**
   - **Action Steps**: Continue with your lunch break mindfulness practice and try guided body scan meditation using an app for 5-10 minutes. Also, use the 4-7-8 breathing technique whenever you feel overwhelmed.

3. **Gratitude/Journaling**
   - **Action Steps**: Write down one thing you’re grateful for each day and note any small victories or accomplishments, no matter how minor they seem.

Would you like to schedule our next session for the same time next week? We can review how these strategies worked for you and adjust them as needed. I want to emphasize that every step forward is valuable, and even small victories are important.

How does this plan sound to you? Are there any areas you feel particularly excited or nervous about, and do you have any questions or concerns about the strategies?

Patient: Yeah, I guess the plan sounds okay. I downloaded that budgeting app you mentioned, Mint, and started tracking my expenses. It's a bit of a pain, but I see how it could help. 

Mindfulness, though... I tried the body scan thing, but it felt kinda weird. I don't know if I'm doing it right. The breathing thing helps a bit when I'm really stressed, but I forget to do it most of the time.

As for the gratitude stuff, I wrote down a few things I'm thankful for. It's hard to remember to do every day, but I get it—it's supposed to help, right?

I'm still not sure about all this, but I'll give it a shot. Just tell me when the next session is.

Therapist: : I'm glad you started using the budgeting app, Derek, and tracking your expenses. It can indeed be a bit challenging at first, but over time it becomes easier and more beneficial. Let's address your concerns about mindfulness and gratitude:

1. **Mindfulness Practice**
   - It's normal to feel a bit uncomfortable when trying new mindfulness techniques. The body scan can sometimes feel strange because it's a deep exploration of your body and emotions. If you're unsure, you might want to try a shorter guided body scan or a different type of mindfulness exercise that feels more comfortable for you, such as focusing on your breath or a mantra. The key is to start small and gradually build up.
   - The 4-7-8 breathing can be very effective, but it's great that you're already finding it helpful. Try to set a reminder on your phone or in your calendar to practice it regularly, even if it's just for a minute or two at a time. You can also try combining it with other activities, like before you go to bed or during a break at work.

2. **Gratitude/Journaling**
   - Writing down things you're grateful for can be challenging, especially when you're busy. Try to find a specific time each day, like right before you go to bed or first thing in the morning, to make it a habit. You might also find it helpful to write down a few things at once when you have a bit of free time.
   - Small victories are indeed important and can boost your mood and self-esteem. Even minor accomplishments are worth noting. It's all about finding what works for you and making it a regular part of your routine.

3. **Scheduling**
   - Our next session is scheduled for the same time next week. We can discuss how these strategies are working for you and make any necessary adjustments. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Remember, Derek, each step forward, no matter how small, is progress. You're doing great, and I believe in you.

How does that sound? Do you have any more questions or would you like to go over anything in more detail?

Patient: Alright, I get what you're saying about mindfulness. Maybe I'll try a different kind of exercise, like focusing on my breath. I can see how that might be easier to get into.

As for the gratitude stuff, I'll try to set a specific time to do it. Maybe before bed, like you said. It's just hard to remember with everything else going on.

I'll keep at it, though. I'll see you next week, and we can talk about how it's going.

Therapist: : That sounds like a great plan, Derek. Focusing on your breath for mindfulness can indeed be a gentler start and is a fantastic way to ground yourself. And setting a specific time, like before bed, can help make it a habit.

Here’s a quick summary of our plan for the upcoming week:

1. **Mindfulness Practice**
   - **Action Steps**: Try focusing on your breath for mindfulness. You can set a daily reminder on your phone to remind you to practice.
   - **Optional**: If you find it helpful, try a guided meditation app that focuses on breathwork.

2. **Gratitude/Journaling**
   - **Action Steps**: Set a specific time, like before bed, to write down things you’re grateful for. Even if you have a busy day, try to jot down a few things. This can be as simple as a good conversation, a beautiful sunset, or a small achievement.

3. **Financial Planning**
   - **Action Steps**: Continue tracking your expenses with Mint and set one specific, achievable financial goal for the week. This could be something simple like saving a certain amount or paying off a small debt.

Before bed for the gratitude stuff should help. I'll make a note to do it every night.
