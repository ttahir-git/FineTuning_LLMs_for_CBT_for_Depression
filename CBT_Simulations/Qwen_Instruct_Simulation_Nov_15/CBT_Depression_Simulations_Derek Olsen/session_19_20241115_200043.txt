Session Number: 19

Patient: Hi, I'm Derek Olsen. This is my 19 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

I appreciate your commitment to getting started with budgeting and tackling your financial challenges. Let's focus specifically on managing those high-interest credit card debts.

### Managing Credit Card Debt

1. **List Your Credit Cards:**
   - Write down each credit card balance
   - Note the interest rate for each card
   - Track minimum payments required

2. **Debt Repayment Strategies:**
   - **Snowball Method**: Pay minimum on all cards, but put extra money toward the smallest balance first. This can help you feel progress quickly.
   - **Avalanche Method**: Focus extra payments on the highest interest rate card first while paying minimums on others. This saves more money in the long run.

3. **Practical Steps:**
   - Consider calling credit card companies to negotiate lower interest rates
   - Look into debt consolidation options if that might help
   - Stop using the cards while paying them down
   - Keep track of payment due dates to avoid late fees

Starting with the $50 monthly emergency fund is excellent - it shows you're thinking ahead. Would you like to discuss these debt management strategies in more detail, or would you prefer to focus on another aspect of your financial plan?

Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again. Thanks for bringing up these points. Let's dive into the debt management strategies and see which approach might work best for you.

### Reviewing Debt Management Strategies

1. **Snowball Method**
   - **Objective**: Focus on paying off the smallest balances first.
   - **How It Helps**: It can build momentum and provide a sense of achievement, which can be motivating.
   - **Example**: If you have three cards with balances of $200, $500, and $1,000, start with the $200 card. Pay the minimum on the others and put extra funds towards the $200 card until it's paid off.

2. **Avalanche Method**
   - **Objective**: Focus on the card with the highest interest rate first.
   - **How It Helps**: This method can save you money in the long run by reducing the total amount of interest paid.
   - **Example**: If your cards have balances and interest rates as follows:
     - Card A: $2,000 balance, 18% interest rate
     - Card B: $1,500 balance, 22% interest rate
     - Card C: $1,000 balance, 16% interest rate
     - You would prioritize paying more towards Card B (22% interest rate).

### Next Steps

1. **Contacting Credit Card Companies**
   - Sometimes credit card companies will negotiate lower interest rates, especially if you have a good payment history.
   - If you decide to call, be prepared to discuss your financial situation and your willingness to stay current on your payments.

2. **Debt Consolidation**
   - This involves taking out a new loan or a line of credit to pay off multiple debts.
   - The new loan often has a lower interest rate, which can make it easier to pay off your debt faster.

3. **Staying Disciplined**
   - Continue to monitor and avoid using your credit cards until your debts are manageable.
   - Set up automatic payments to avoid late fees and maintain good credit standing.

### Additional Considerations

- **Emergency Fund**: You’ve already started with a $50 monthly contribution, which is a great start. We can continue to monitor this and adjust as needed.
- **Budgeting**: Let's ensure that your budget includes all necessary expenses and set aside a portion for debt repayment.

Which strategy do you think you might prefer to start with, or do you have any questions about these methods?

Patient: Hey, Nova. I appreciate you laying out these options. It's a lot to take in, especially with my head not in the best space lately. 

The snowball method sounds like it might give me a quick win, you know? Paying off that smallest balance first could be just the push I need to keep going. But the avalanche method, with focusing on the highest interest rate, that makes sense too. I don't want to be throwing money away on interest if I can avoid it.

I guess what I'm wondering is, does one of these methods work better if I’m trying to keep my head above water while managing my pain and other stuff? I don't want to waste time or energy on something that's just gonna add to my stress in the long run.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Derek. It's completely understandable that dealing with financial stress on top of other challenges can be overwhelming. Both methods have their advantages, and choosing the one that feels most manageable for you is important.

### Choosing the Right Method

Given your desire for a quick win to help keep your head above water, the **Snowball Method** might indeed be a better fit. Here's why:

1. **Motivation and Quick Wins**: The Snowball Method provides quick wins by tackling the smallest balances first. This can give you a psychological boost and make the process feel more achievable, which can help you stay motivated.
2. **Reducing the Number of Cards**: As you pay off the smallest balances, you reduce the number of cards you have to manage, which can simplify your financial life and reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.
3. **Staying Focused**: Focusing on one card at a time can help you maintain your focus and avoid the distraction of multiple balances and interest rates.

### Practical Steps to Start

1. **List Your Credit Cards**: Write down each credit card balance and the interest rate.
2. **Prioritize Based on Balance**: Start with the smallest balance and pay the minimums on the others.
3. **Allocate Extra Funds**: Redirect any extra money (like from the $50 monthly emergency fund) towards the smallest balance.
4. **Monitor Progress**: Keep track of your progress and celebrate each small win along the way.

### Additional Tips

- **Mindfulness**: When you're feeling stressed, take a moment to practice mindfulness. This can help you stay present and focused on your goals.
- **Support System**: Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or support groups for emotional support.
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your progress and make adjustments as needed. You can switch methods if the Snowball Method isn't providing the quick wins you need or if you find the Avalanche Method more beneficial over time.

### Next Steps

1. **Start Implementing the Snowball Method**: Begin by paying the minimum on all cards except for the one with the smallest balance. Put any extra money towards that card.
2. **Negotiate Lower Interest Rates**: Consider contacting your credit card companies to see if they can lower your interest rates.
3. **Review Your Budget**: Ensure your budget includes all necessary expenses and set aside a portion for debt repayment. Adjust as needed to make sure you stay on track.

Which of these steps would you like to start with, or do you have any specific questions about how to implement the Snowball Method?

I hear you - managing debt can feel overwhelming, especially when you're already dealing with chronic pain and mental health challenges. It's completely understandable that you want to choose an approach that won't add to your stress load.

Let's think about this in terms of your overall wellbeing. The snowball method might be particularly beneficial for you right now because:
1. It provides quick wins, which can boost your motivation when pain and stress are high
2. It's simpler to track and manage, requiring less mental energy
3. Those small victories can help counter the feelings of being overwhelmed

However, I'm curious - what does "keeping your head above water" look like for you right now? Understanding this might help us determine which approach would feel most manageable while still being effective.
