Session Number: 1

Patient: Hi, I'm Derek Olsen. This is my first CBT session. I'm here because I've been feeling down lately.

Therapist: Hello, Derek. It's great to meet you. I'm glad you're here today. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling "down"? Are there any specific situations or events that have contributed to these feelings?

Patient: Well, it's been a rough few years. Ever since I hurt my back on the job, everything's gone downhill. I can't work, can't do the things I used to love, like woodworking and fishing. The pain's constant, and it's hard to sleep. Plus, I lost my job, and now I'm barely scraping by on disability. It's like I've lost my whole identity.

Therapist: Hello, Derek. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of challenging circumstances right now. Let's break this down a bit. The back injury and the loss of your job and ability to do your favorite activities seem to be significant stressors. The financial struggles and the loss of your identity as a worker must be incredibly difficult to navigate. 

In Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, we often look at how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors interact. Could you tell me more about any thoughts or beliefs you have about these situations? For instance, do you have any thoughts that make the situation seem worse than it is or thoughts that are affecting your daily life in a negative way?

Patient: Yeah, I guess I think a lot about how I'm just a burden now. I used to be the one taking care of things, providing for my family, and now I can't even do that. It feels like I'm just a drain on everyone around me. And the pain, it's always there, making everything else seem worse. I keep thinking, "What's the point?"

Therapist: Thank you for sharing those thoughts, Derek. It's completely understandable to feel like a burden and to question the purpose of your life under such challenging circumstances. However, it's important to remember that these thoughts are just one part of your experience and can be explored further to understand their impact and potential distortions.

In CBT, we often look at automatic thoughts, which are often quick, negative thoughts that pop into our minds without us realizing it. These thoughts can be irrational or unhelpful and can significantly affect our mood and behaviors. Let's explore some of these thoughts more closely.

1. **Thought: "I'm just a burden now."**
   - **Questioning the Thought:** Is this thought based on facts? How many times have you actually felt like a burden to others? Have your loved ones expressed feelings of being overwhelmed by you or dependent on you?
   - **Evidence Against the Thought:** Maybe you have helped others in the past and are still valued for your contributions, even if they are different now. Maybe your loved ones appreciate the time you spend with them and the support you provide.

2. **Thought: "I used to be the one taking care of things, providing for my family, and now I can't even do that."**
   - **Questioning the Thought:** Has your role in your family changed, but not ended? Can you still provide emotional support, guidance, or help in other ways?
   - **Evidence Against the Thought:** You might still be contributing to your family in meaningful ways, perhaps by providing emotional support or helping with household tasks.

3. **Thought: "What's the point?"**
   - **Questioning the Thought:** What are the things you still enjoy or find meaningful? Even though you can't work in your previous job, are there other activities or roles that bring you joy or a sense of purpose?
   - **Evidence Against the Thought:** Perhaps you can find new hobbies, volunteer work, or other roles that give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Engaging in activities that you find enjoyable can help improve your mood and outlook.

Let's also look at any **cognitive distortions** that might be contributing to these negative thoughts. Common distortions include:

- **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Viewing things as either completely positive or completely negative. For example, you might believe that if you can't work in your previous job, you're completely useless.
- **Overgeneralization:** Taking one negative event and seeing it as a never-ending pattern of defeat. For example, the loss of your job might lead you to believe that you'll never find work again.
- **Catastrophizing:** Expecting the worst possible outcome. For example, you might believe that because you're in pain, your life will be miserable forever.

Can you identify any of these distortions in your thoughts? By challenging these thoughts and finding more balanced perspectives, we can work towards improving your mood.

Patient: I see what you're getting at, but it's not that simple. I mean, I get where you're coming from with these questions, but it's hard to see things differently when you're in the middle of it all. I can't just snap my fingers and feel better about being a burden. My kids don't really talk to me much anymore, and I know they're struggling with their own stuff. I guess I do see some of those distortions in my thinking, like thinking I'm completely useless if I can't do my old job. But it's not like I can just switch gears and find a new purpose overnight. It's been years of this, and it's tough to change that mindset.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Derek. It’s completely valid to feel overwhelmed and stuck, especially given the duration and intensity of the challenges you’ve been facing. However, let’s break it down step by step and work on making some progress, even if it’s small.

### Breaking It Down

1. **Emotional Support and Validation:**
   - It’s important to acknowledge and validate your feelings. What you’re experiencing is understandable, and it’s okay to feel burdened. But let’s explore how you can shift your perspective a bit.

2. **Identifying Distortions:**
   - Let’s revisit the distortions and think about ways to challenge them:

   **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**
   - **Thought:** "I used to be the one providing for my family, and now I can't do that."
   - **Challenging the Thought:** What are the other ways you’re contributing? Perhaps you’re providing emotional support, helping with household chores, or spending time with your kids, even if it’s in a different capacity.

   **Overgeneralization:**
   - **Thought:** "I can never find another purpose in life."
   - **Challenging the Thought:** Are there other roles or activities you enjoy or find meaningful? Even small steps can help. For example, could you start small with a new hobby or volunteering?

   **Catastrophizing:**
   - **Thought:** "If I can’t find a job, my life will be miserable forever."
   - **Challenging the Thought:** What if you found a part-time job, a new hobby, or started volunteering? Each step can help reduce the feeling of being stuck.

3. **Setting Small, Manageable Goals:**
   - Let’s focus on setting some small, achievable goals. For example:
     - **Goal:** Find one new hobby or activity to try.
     - **Goal:** Spend 10 minutes a day doing something enjoyable.
     - **Goal:** Have a short conversation with your kids about how you’re feeling and how they’re doing.

4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:**
   - Mindfulness can help you stay grounded in the present moment, reducing feelings of hopelessness. Techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery might be helpful.
     - **Exercise:** Try a deep breathing exercise: inhale slowly through your nose for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 2 seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth for 6 seconds. Do this for a few minutes.

### Next Steps

1. **Identify One Small Change:**
   - Start with one small change. For example, can you find a new hobby or activity that interests you? It could be as simple as trying a new recipe or reading a book.
   
2. **Schedule Regular Check-Ins:**
   - Let’s schedule a check-in for next week to.

Patient: I appreciate the effort, but I don't think I can just pick up a new hobby like that. I've tried a few things, but nothing really sticks. And talking to my kids about how I'm feeling? That's not going to go well. They've got their own lives and problems, and I don't want to burden them more. I guess I can try that breathing thing you mentioned, but I'm not sure how much it'll help. I'm just tired of all this, you know?

Therapist: I understand how you feel, Derek. It’s natural to feel overwhelmed and like nothing will change. Let’s focus on what might be most manageable for you right now. Sometimes, small, consistent efforts can add up over time, even if they feel insignificant in the moment.

### Let’s Break It Down Again

1. **Mindfulness and Relaxation:**
   - You mentioned the deep breathing exercise. Let’s try this together to see if it helps.

   - **Breathing Exercise:**
     - Inhale slowly through your nose for 4 seconds.
     - Hold your breath for 2 seconds.
     - Exhale slowly through your mouth for 6 seconds.
     - Repeat this for 5 minutes.

   - Try to do this every day at the same time, perhaps in the morning or before bed. Consistency can be key.

2. **Setting Boundaries:**
   - It’s important to recognize that you have limits, and it’s okay to set boundaries. You can express how you feel without putting additional burden on your kids.

   - **Suggested Conversation:**
     - “I know you have your own lives and responsibilities, but I just wanted to check in with you. I’ve been feeling really down lately, and I don’t want to be a burden. Can we talk about how I might be able to help or support you, even if it’s small?”

3. **Connecting with Others:**
   - Sometimes, talking to someone outside of your immediate family can provide support. This could be a friend, a counselor, or a support group.

4. **Exploring Support Services:**
   - There are resources available that can provide additional support. These might include:
     - **Physical Therapy:** To help manage your back pain and possibly improve your mobility.
     - **Financial Assistance Programs:** To help with financial stress.
     - **Support Groups:** For individuals dealing with similar challenges.

5. **Small, Manageable Goals:**
   - Let’s focus on one small, manageable goal. Even small steps can build momentum:
     - **Goal:** Spend 5 minutes a day on a new hobby or activity.
     - **Goal:** Engage in a brief conversation with a friend or a trusted family member about your feelings.

### Next Steps

1. **Try the Breathing Exercise:**
   - Let’s start with the breathing exercise now. We’ll do it together.

2. **Plan a Small Step:**
   - Can we plan for a small step, like finding a new hobby or engaging in a conversation with someone you trust?

3. **Schedule a Follow-Up:**
   - Let’s set up a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss how things are going and make any necessary adjustments.

### Starting the Breathing Exercise

Let’s begin:

1. **Inhale slowly through your nose for 4 seconds.**
2. **Hold your breath for.

Patient: Alright, let's give this breathing thing a shot. I'll try it for the next few days and see if it helps. As for talking to my kids, I'll think about it. Maybe I can reach out to them in a way that doesn't feel like I'm dumping my problems on them. I'll also look into some of those resources you mentioned, like physical therapy and financial assistance. It's worth a try, I guess.

Therapist: : That’s a great approach, Derek. Taking small, manageable steps can be incredibly effective, even if you don’t feel immediate results. Let’s go through the breathing exercise now and then we can discuss your next steps.

### Deep Breathing Exercise

1. **Inhale slowly through your nose for 4 seconds.**
2. **Hold your breath for 2 seconds.**
3. **Exhale slowly through your mouth for 6 seconds.**
4. **Repeat this process for 5 minutes.**

Try to focus on your breath and the sensations in your body during this exercise. It can be helpful to close your eyes and visualize a peaceful scene if that feels comfortable for you.

After we finish, we can discuss how you felt during the exercise and plan your next steps. Remember, the goal is not to fix everything right away, but to start creating small changes that can have a positive impact on your well-being.

Take a moment to focus on your breath now. Ready to start?

Patient: Alright, I'm ready. Let's do this.

Therapist: : Great, Derek. Let's begin the deep breathing exercise together.

1. **Inhale slowly through your nose for 4 seconds.**
2. **Hold your breath for 2 seconds.**
3. **Exhale slowly through your mouth for 6 seconds.**
4. **Repeat this process for 5 minutes.**

Take a moment to focus on your breath and the sensations in your body. Close your eyes if that helps you to relax and visualize a peaceful scene. Remember, the goal is to simply focus on the breathing and not to force anything.

I'll count out the seconds for you:

- Inhale for 4 seconds: 1... 2... 3... 4... (hold)
- Hold for 2 seconds: 1... 2... (exhale)
- Exhale for 6 seconds: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6...

Let's do this together for 5 minutes. You can do it!

Take a deep breath now and start the countdown.

- Inhale: 1... 2... 3... 4... (hold)
- Hold: 1... 2... (exhale)
- Exhale: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6...

Continue this pattern for the next few minutes. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your focus back to your breath.

After we finish, we can discuss how you felt during the exercise and plan your next steps.

Patient: Alright, I did it. It wasn't too bad, actually. I felt a bit calmer by the end. I guess it's something I can keep doing. As for the next steps, I'll try to reach out to my kids and see if we can talk. And I'll look into those resources you mentioned. Maybe something will come of it.

Therapist: : That’s wonderful, Derek. I’m glad you found the breathing exercise helpful and that you’re open to continuing it. It’s a great tool to have in your toolkit for managing stress and improving your mood.

### Next Steps

1. **Continue with the Breathing Exercise:**
   - Try to do the breathing exercise daily, perhaps in the morning or before bed. It can become a calming ritual that helps ground you.

2. **Plan a Conversation with Your Kids:**
   - Set a time to talk to your kids. You could start with a simple, non-judgmental question like, "How have you been doing lately? How can I support you in any small way?" This can help open the lines of communication and show that you care.

3. **Explore Resources:**
   - Look into physical therapy to help manage your back pain. You can start by calling a local clinic or checking online for recommendations.
   - Explore financial assistance programs. Many communities have resources like food banks, utility assistance, and other support services.
   - Consider joining a support group. These can provide a community of people facing similar challenges and can offer emotional support and practical advice.

4. **Set a Small Goal:**
   - Try to engage in a new activity or hobby for just 5 minutes a day. Even small steps can build momentum and provide a sense of accomplishment.

### Plan for Next Steps

1. **Breathing Exercise Reminder:**
   - Set a reminder on your phone to do the breathing exercise every day. You could start with the morning or before bed.

2. **Talking to Your Kids:**
   - Plan a specific time to talk to your kids. It might be helpful to write down a few points you want to cover beforehand.

3. **Resource Exploration:**
   - Make a list of potential resources to check out. You could start with a local community center or social services office.

4. **Activity or Hobby:**
   - Think of a new activity or hobby that interests you. It could be something simple like reading a book or trying a new recipe.

### Follow-Up

1. **Check-In:**
   - We can set up a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss how you’re doing. Let’s plan for a call or a session to go over your progress.

2. **Support System:**
   - Remember, it’s important to reach out for support. Sometimes, just knowing you have a plan and steps to take can be a big relief.

Thank you for your openness and willingness to try these strategies. Let’s take it one step at a time and see where this journey leads you. You’ve already made a good start, and with continued effort, you can find some relief and improve your well-being.

Would you like to set a specific time for the follow-up appointment, or should we just make sure to touch base in a week?

Patient: Let's set a specific time for the follow-up appointment. How about next Wednesday at the same time? That gives me a week to try out these things and see how it goes. I'll do my best to reach out to my kids and look into those resources. Thanks for the help, Nova.
