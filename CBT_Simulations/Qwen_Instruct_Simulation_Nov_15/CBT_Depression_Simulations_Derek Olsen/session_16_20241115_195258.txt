Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? I see we covered a lot of ground, including your feelings of worthlessness, the impact of your physical pain, and some mindfulness exercises. Let's start by going over how you've been doing with the mindfulness exercises and the small tasks you've been trying to accomplish. How have those been going for you?

Patient: Hey, Nova. I've been alright, I guess. The mindfulness exercises, they're not really my thing. I tried a couple of times, but it feels like a waste of time. As for the small tasks, I managed to help a neighbor fix a leaky faucet last week. That felt good, even if it was just a little thing.

Therapist: Hello Derek, thank you for sharing that with me. I can understand why you might feel that way about the mindfulness exercises; sometimes it takes a bit of practice to find the benefit in them. It's important to remember that mindfulness is a skill, and like any skill, it improves with practice. Maybe we can explore a few ways to make it more engaging for you. For example, we could try incorporating a guided mindfulness app or recording a short guided session that focuses on something you enjoy, like nature sounds or a place you love.

Regarding the small tasks, it's great that you managed to help a neighbor! That’s a wonderful way to contribute and it's important to acknowledge the positive feelings that come with it. How did you feel when you completed that task? Did you notice any change in your mood or physical sensations?

Let's also discuss the thought record exercise. You’ve made significant progress by identifying evidence against negative thoughts. This is a crucial step. Can you share a recent situation where you had negative thoughts about being a burden or not feeling worthy? We can work through it together and explore more evidence to challenge those thoughts.

Patient: I appreciate the suggestion about the mindfulness exercises, but I'm not sure it's for me. I'll give it another shot, though. As for helping my neighbor, it felt good to be useful again. I didn't really notice much of a change in my mood, but it did take my mind off the pain for a bit.

About the thought record exercise, I had a tough day last week. My daughter called to check on me, and I couldn't help but think she only called because she feels obligated. I felt like a burden, like I'm just a problem for her to deal with.

Therapist: Hello Derek, thank you for sharing that experience. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you're dealing with physical pain and the emotional strain that comes with it. Let’s break this down further using our thought record exercise. We’ll focus on your daughter’s phone call and the thoughts that followed.

1. **Situation**: Your daughter called to check on you.
2. **Initial Thoughts**:
   - "She only called because she feels obligated."
   - "I'm a burden."
   - "She probably wishes she didn't have to talk to me."
3. **Evidence for Initial Thoughts**:
   - Did she sound genuine and concerned? Was there any hesitation or discomfort in her tone?
   - Have you noticed other times when she has called or checked on you that she seemed genuinely worried?
   - Can you think of any positive things she has done for you recently, even if they seem small?
4. **Challenging Thoughts**:
   - Consider alternative explanations for her call. Maybe she cares and wanted to ensure you're okay.
   - Think about times when you have checked on her or others and how that made them feel.
   - Reflect on how her call might have affected you emotionally and physically.

Let's start with the evidence. Can you recall any specific details from her call that might support or refute the idea that she only called because she feels obligated? Also, how do you think her call might have affected you emotionally or physically?

By exploring these details, we can start to build a more balanced and accurate perspective on the situation. This can help reduce feelings of being a burden and improve your mood.

Patient: I see what you're getting at, but it's hard to remember specifics when I'm feeling down. She did sound genuine, I guess. She asked about my pain and if I needed anything. There was no hesitation in her voice, just concern.

As for other times, she's been checking in more often lately. She even offered to help with some chores around the house. I didn't take her up on it, but it was nice to know she was thinking of me.

Her call did make me feel a bit better emotionally. It was a distraction from the pain, and it reminded me that someone still cares. Physically, it didn't change much, but it did lift my spirits for a while.

Therapist: : That's great to hear, Derek. It's important to acknowledge the positive aspects, even if they don't completely shift your mood right away. Recognizing the genuine care from your daughter can be a significant comfort and a source of strength.

Let’s summarize what we've learned from this thought record exercise:

1. **Situation**: Your daughter called to check on you.
2. **Initial Thoughts**:
   - "She only called because she feels obligated."
   - "I'm a burden."
   - "She probably wishes she didn't have to talk to me."

3. **Evidence for Initial Thoughts**:
   - Her tone was genuine and concerned, with no hesitation.
   - She asked about your pain and if you needed anything.
   - She has been checking in more often lately and offered to help with chores.
   - Her call lifted your spirits and distracted you from the pain for a while.

4. **Challenging Thoughts**:
   - Alternative explanations: She might care and want to ensure you're okay.
   - Reflection on past interactions: You have noticed other times when she has shown genuine concern.
   - Positive impact: Her call made you feel better and reminded you that someone still cares.

Now, let's explore how we can incorporate these insights into your daily routine and continue to build on your progress. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Mindfulness Exercises**: 
   - Continue with the guided mindfulness app or recordings. Try to find a guided session that focuses on positive aspects of your day, such as moments of connection or small acts of kindness.
   - Set aside a specific time each day to practice mindfulness, even if it's just a few minutes.

2. **Small Tasks**:
   - Keep up with the small tasks you’ve been doing, even if they seem minor. These contributions can add up and make a significant difference in your sense of worth.
   - Consider setting a goal to notice and record three positive things each day, even if they are small. This can help shift your focus to the positive aspects of your life.

3. **Thought Records**:
   - Continue using the thought record exercise to challenge negative thoughts. Whenever you experience negative thoughts, try to break them down and find evidence that challenges those thoughts.
   - You might want to keep a thought journal to track your progress and reflect on your thoughts over time.

4. **Support Systems**:
   - Continue to explore the support from your family, friends, and other resources. Your daughter's concern is a valuable part of your support network.
   - Don’t hesitate to seek professional therapy support if you find it helpful. Sometimes talking to a therapist can provide additional tools and perspectives.

5. **Physical Pain Management**:
   - Continue to work on techniques to manage your physical pain, such as breathing exercises and any physical therapy or pain management strategies your doctor has recommended.
   - Consider gentle exercises or stretching that you can do from home.

Patient: Thanks for the suggestions, Nova. I'll give the mindfulness exercises another try, even if it feels awkward at first. The thought record exercise is helpful, and I'll keep doing it to challenge those negative thoughts.

As for the small tasks, I'll keep trying to contribute where I can. It's good to feel useful, even if it's just a little bit.
