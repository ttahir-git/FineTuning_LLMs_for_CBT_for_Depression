Session Number: 18

Patient: Hi, I'm Samantha Chen. This is my 18 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

I'm glad these strategies resonate with you, Samantha. Before we wrap up today's session, let's create a clear action plan for the next few weeks:

### Action Plan:

1. **Preparation (This Week)**:
   - Draft your thoughts and organize them clearly
   - Write down specific "I" statements you want to use
   - Practice these statements out loud
   - Share your draft with Michael for feedback

2. **Planning the Conversation**:
   - Choose a specific date and time when everyone is relaxed
   - Select a comfortable, neutral setting
   - Let your parents know you'd like to have a meaningful conversation about your future

3. **Follow-up**:
   - Keep notes about how the conversation goes
   - Document what worked well and what didn't
   - We can discuss the outcomes in our next session

### Homework:
1. Write your draft and practice the "I" statements we discussed
2. Schedule the conversation with your parents
3. Journal about your feelings before and after the conversation

Would you like to add anything to this plan? Are there any specific concerns you'd like to address before we end today's session?

Therapist: Hello Samantha, it’s great to hear from you again. I'm glad we have a clear action plan to help you prepare for the conversation with your parents. Before we finalize this plan, do you have any specific concerns or additional points you'd like to add?

For example:
- Are there any particular challenges you foresee that you’d like to prepare for?
- Do you have any specific questions about how to handle potential reactions from your parents?
- Are there any other aspects of the conversation you’d like to cover?

Feel free to share any thoughts or additional steps you think would be helpful. This will ensure that you feel fully prepared and confident for your discussion.

Patient: I’m worried that my parents might start arguing with me in front of other family members during our dinner. I want to avoid that, but I’m not sure how to steer the conversation away from conflict once it starts. Do you have any suggestions for managing that?

Therapist: It’s understandable to feel concerned about the potential for conflict, especially in a setting like a family dinner. Here are a few strategies to help manage that situation:

1. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Before the conversation, let your parents know that you would prefer to have this discussion in a more private setting if possible. This can help prevent the conversation from escalating into a public argument.

2. **Stay Calm and Focused**: Try to maintain a calm demeanor and stay focused on the topics you need to discuss. If you notice your parents becoming agitated, take a moment to pause and restate your points in a calm and clear manner.

3. **Use Non-Defensive Language**: Continue to use your "I" statements to express your thoughts and feelings without blaming or accusing. For example, instead of saying "You always...," you could say, "I feel... when... because..."

4. **Agree on Agreements**: If the conversation does start to get heated, focus on finding common ground and agreeing on some basic principles. For example, you might say, "I know we disagree, but we can both agree that our goal is to support each other and find a way to make things work for everyone."

5. **Redirect the Conversation**: If the discussion starts to spiral, you can gently redirect the conversation back to the original topics by saying, "I understand you have concerns, but let’s focus on the main points we need to discuss."

6. **Take a Break if Necessary**: If things start to get too heated, suggest a short break to cool down. You might say, "Let’s take a moment to regroup and come back to this later if we need to."

7. **Seek Support**: If you feel overwhelmed, consider bringing a close family member or friend who can support you during the conversation.

These strategies can help you stay in control of the conversation and reduce the likelihood of it becoming a public argument. Let me know if you need more detailed guidance on any of these points or if you have any other concerns.

Patient: Thank you for the detailed strategies. I think setting clear boundaries and using non-defensive language will be especially helpful. I’ll also practice staying calm and focused, which is something I struggle with when I’m anxious. I’ll let you know how it goes after the conversation.

Therapist: : You're welcome, Samantha. It's great to hear that you find these strategies helpful. Practicing staying calm and focused, along with using non-defensive language, can indeed make a significant difference. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and practice will help build your confidence.

I'm here to support you through this process. If you need any additional tips or support leading up to the conversation, please don't hesitate to reach out. You've already made great progress, and with these strategies, you'll be well-prepared to handle the conversation thoughtfully and effectively.

Feel free to keep me updated on how it goes, and we can discuss any further adjustments or support you might need in our next session. Take care, and good luck!
