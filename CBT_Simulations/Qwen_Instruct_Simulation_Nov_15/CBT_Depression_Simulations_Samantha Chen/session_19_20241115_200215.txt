Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again. Thank you for summarizing our previous session. It seems like you've made significant progress in identifying specific strategies to manage potential conflict during family gatherings. This is a crucial step in handling challenging situations more effectively.

Let's pick up where we left off and ensure you feel confident and prepared for the upcoming family dinner. Here are a few points we might want to review and expand upon:

1. **Revisiting Boundary Setting**: How are you feeling about setting boundaries before the conversation? Do you think you have a clear plan for when and how you will set these boundaries? Any adjustments or additional strategies you might want to consider?

2. **Non-Defensive Language**: We talked about using "I" statements and non-defensive language. Can you share a recent situation where you used this technique, and how it went? Are there any specific phrases or approaches you feel could be strengthened?

3. **Maintaining Composure**: What triggers your anxiety during family discussions? How can you stay focused and calm when those triggers arise? Are there relaxation techniques or other methods you find helpful in these moments?

4. **Conversation Management**: How do you plan to redirect conversations if they start to spiral into conflict? Are there certain topics or people you need to be especially mindful of?

5. **Taking Breaks**: If you feel the discussion is getting too intense, what steps are you taking to manage this? Is there a specific signal or action you plan to use to request a break?

Additionally, let's talk about your upcoming family dinner. Do you have any specific concerns or challenges you're anticipating? How can we tailor our strategies to address those particular concerns?

Lastly, I would like to remind you that it's okay if some of these strategies take time to perfect. The key is to keep practicing and adjusting as needed. Remember to take care of yourself both physically and emotionally as you navigate this family interaction.
