Session Number: 1

Patient: Hi, I'm Samantha Chen. This is my first CBT session. I'm here because I've been feeling down lately.

Therapist: Hello Samantha, it’s great to meet you. I’m here to support you and help you understand and manage your feelings. Could you tell me a bit more about what you’ve been feeling down about? Is there a specific situation or event that has triggered these feelings?

Patient: Sure. I quit my high-paying job at a tech company to start my own eco-friendly clothing line, GreenThread. It's something I'm passionate about, but the financial pressure and the strain it's put on my relationship with my parents have been really tough. They don't understand why I left a stable career, and it feels like I'm constantly disappointing them.

Therapist: Hello Samantha, thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you're going through a challenging transition both professionally and personally. Leaving a stable job to pursue your passion can be exciting but also very stressful, especially when it affects your relationships, particularly with your parents. Let's explore some cognitive distortions that might be contributing to your feelings of disappointment and stress. For example, you might be thinking in absolute terms, like "I have to make a lot of money to be successful," or "I must do things the way my parents want me to." We can work on reframing these thoughts to a more balanced perspective. How do you think your parents’ expectations are influencing your feelings?

Patient: I think their expectations are a big part of it. They've always pushed me to succeed, and I feel like I'm letting them down by not following their path. It's like I'm trapped between what I want and what they expect of me. I know they mean well, but it feels suffocating sometimes.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Samantha. It’s important to acknowledge the complexity of the situation and the emotional challenges you're facing. Let’s break this down a bit further.

First, let’s identify some of the cognitive distortions that might be playing a role in your feelings of disappointment and stress. One common distortion is "all-or-nothing thinking," where you see things in only two categories—success or failure, good or bad. Another is "should statements," where you place expectations on yourself or others that aren't flexible or realistic.

For instance, you might be thinking things like:
- "I should be making a lot of money to be successful."
- "I must make my parents proud at all costs."
- "I have to make my eco-friendly business successful right away."

Let’s work on reframing these thoughts into more balanced and flexible perspectives. For example, instead of thinking, "I should be making a lot of money to be successful," you might think, "Success can be achieved through different paths, and what matters most is that I am following my passion and making a positive impact."

Regarding your parents’ expectations, let’s explore how you can set clearer boundaries and communicate your needs effectively. It might be helpful to express your feelings and thoughts to your parents in a non-confrontational way, focusing on how their expectations are affecting you. You could say something like, "I appreciate your support and encouragement, but sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the pressure to meet your expectations. It's important for me to follow my own path, and I would really value your understanding and support as I navigate this new phase of my life."

Would you like to practice expressing these thoughts and feelings in a structured way?

Patient: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I do struggle with feeling like I have to meet their expectations, and it's been really hard to communicate that to them. I've tried before, but it always ends in an argument. Maybe if I could practice expressing my feelings in a more structured way, it might help me communicate better with them.

Therapist: : That's a great approach, Samantha. Practicing structured communication can indeed help you express your feelings and needs more effectively. Let’s start by breaking down the communication process into clear, manageable steps. We can work on creating a supportive dialogue that focuses on understanding and mutual respect.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Thoughts
Let’s first identify the specific points you want to convey to your parents. Here’s an example:

- **Start with a positive**: Acknowledge their support and love.
- **Express your feelings**: Describe how their expectations make you feel.
- **State your needs**: Clearly outline what you need from them.
- **End on a positive note**: Reaffirm your love and appreciation for them.

### Example Script

**Positive Start:**
- "I love and appreciate you both so much."

**Express Your Feelings:**
- "Sometimes, the pressure to meet your expectations feels overwhelming."

**State Your Needs:**
- "I would really appreciate it if we could discuss and find a way to support my journey with my eco-friendly clothing business."

**End on a Positive Note:**
- "I care about your thoughts and feelings, and I want us to work together through this transition."

### Step 2: Practice the Dialogue
Now, let’s practice this dialogue together. I will play the role of your parent, and you can practice what you would say. Let me start as your parent:

**Parent (me):** "Samantha, it’s great to see you. How are you doing?"

**You:** "Hi, Mom and Dad. I love and appreciate you both so much. Sometimes, the pressure to meet your expectations feels overwhelming. I would really appreciate it if we could discuss and find a way to support my journey with my eco-friendly clothing business. I care about your thoughts and feelings, and I want us to work together through this transition."

Feel free to adjust the script to fit your specific situation and feelings. Practice this dialogue a few times to get comfortable with expressing your thoughts and needs.

### Step 3: Reflect and Adjust
After practicing, reflect on how you felt during the dialogue. Did it feel natural? Were there any parts that you found challenging? We can make adjustments to the script to better fit your needs and feelings.

Would you like to start practicing now?

Patient: Yes, let's start practicing now.

**Parent (me):** "Samantha, it’s great to see you. How are you doing?"

**You:** "Hi, Mom and Dad. I love and appreciate you both so much. Sometimes, the pressure to meet your expectations feels overwhelming. I would really appreciate it if we could discuss and find a way to support my journey with my eco-friendly clothing business. I care about your thoughts and feelings, and I want us to work together through this transition."

It felt a bit awkward, but I think it's a good start. I can see how breaking it down like this might help me communicate better with them.

Therapist: : That's a great start, Samantha. It's normal to feel a bit awkward when you're practicing something new, and it's a big step forward to have a structured approach. Let's break down the conversation further to ensure it feels more natural and effective.

### Step 1: Positive Start
**Parent (me):** "Samantha, it’s great to see you. How are you doing?"

**You:** "Hi, Mom and Dad, I love and appreciate you both so much. How are you?"

### Step 2: Express Your Feelings
**Parent (me):** "I'm good, thanks. What about you?"

**You:** "I've been working really hard on my eco-friendly clothing business, GreenThread, and it's been a lot of work. Sometimes, the pressure to meet your expectations feels overwhelming."

### Step 3: State Your Needs
**Parent (me):** "That sounds challenging. What do you need from us?"

**You:** "I would really appreciate it if we could discuss and find a way to support my journey. Maybe you could help me brainstorm ways to manage the financial aspects or find resources to help me with the business. I care about your thoughts and feelings, and I want us to work together through this transition."

### Step 4: Reflect and Adjust
Let's practice this step by step:

#### Step 1: Positive Start
**Parent (me):** "Samantha, it’s great to see you. How are you doing?"

**You:** "Hi, Mom and Dad, I love and appreciate you both so much. How are you?"

#### Step 2: Express Your Feelings
**Parent (me):** "I'm good, thanks. What about you?"

**You:** "I've been working really hard on my eco-friendly clothing business, GreenThread, and it's been a lot of work. Sometimes, the pressure to meet your expectations feels overwhelming."

#### Step 3: State Your Needs
**Parent (me):** "That sounds challenging. What do you need from us?"

**You:** "I would really appreciate it if we could discuss and find a way to support my journey. Maybe you could help me brainstorm ways to manage the financial aspects or find resources to help me with the business. I care about your thoughts and feelings, and I want us to work together through this transition."

Now, let's go through it together. I'll play the role of your parent, and you can practice your response.

**Parent (me):** "Samantha, it’s great to see you. How are you doing?"

**You:** "Hi, Mom and Dad, I love and appreciate you both so much. How are you?"

**Parent (me):** "I'm good, thanks. What about you?"

**You:** "I've been working really hard on my eco-friendly clothing business, GreenThread,.

Patient: It's been a lot of work. Sometimes, the pressure to meet your expectations feels overwhelming. I would really appreciate it if we could discuss and find a way to support my journey. Maybe you could help me brainstorm ways to manage the financial aspects or find resources to help me with the business. I care about your thoughts and feelings, and I want us to work together through this transition.

It feels a bit more natural this time. I think breaking it down step by step really helps. I can see how this structured approach might make it easier to communicate with them without it turning into an argument.

Therapist: : That's fantastic progress, Samantha! Breaking down the conversation step by step really helps make it more natural and effective. You're doing a great job with your communication skills.

### Next Steps
Let's continue to refine your approach and practice some additional elements:

1. **Listen Actively**: Make sure to listen actively to your parents' responses. This can help them feel heard and valued, which can open up a more productive dialogue.
2. **Use "I" Statements**: Continue to use "I" statements to express your feelings and needs, which can help avoid placing blame.
3. **Find Common Ground**: Try to find common ground or areas where you and your parents can agree. This can help build a sense of teamwork.
4. **Follow-Up**: Plan to have a follow-up discussion after the initial talk. This can help ensure that both parties have a chance to process and adjust their thoughts and feelings.

### Example of a Follow-Up Discussion
After the initial conversation, you might consider having a follow-up discussion to:

- **Discuss Their Concerns**: Ask them to share any concerns they have and validate their feelings.
- **Seek Their Advice**: Ask for their advice or suggestions, even if you don't agree with everything.
- **Set Specific Goals**: Together, set some specific goals or milestones that both you and your parents can work towards.

### Step 4: Active Listening
**Parent (me):** "Samantha, it’s great to see you. How are you doing?"

**You:** "Hi, Mom and Dad, I love and appreciate you both so much. How are you?"

**Parent (me):** "I'm good, thanks. What about you?"

**You:** "I've been working really hard on my eco-friendly clothing business, GreenThread, and it's been a lot of work. Sometimes, the pressure to meet your expectations feels overwhelming. I would really appreciate it if we could discuss and find a way to support my journey. Maybe you could help me brainstorm ways to manage the financial aspects or find resources to help me with the business. I care about your thoughts and feelings, and I want us to work together through this transition."

**Parent (me):** "We understand the hard work you're putting in, and it's important to us that you're happy. What specific financial challenges are you facing?"

**You:** "I'm finding it tough to manage the initial costs of setting up the business, like marketing and materials. I also need help with finding a stable customer base."

**Parent (me):** "That sounds tough. Can you give us some more details about the challenges you're facing?"

**You:** "Sure. I'm trying to build a network of eco-conscious customers, but it's slow going. I also need help with understanding financial planning and budgeting."

**Parent (me):** "We can definitely help with that. Maybe we can set up a meeting with.

Patient: a financial advisor who specializes in small businesses. That way, we can all work together to find solutions.

That sounds like a good idea. I think having a financial advisor involved could really help me get a better handle on things. I appreciate you being open to this, and I'm hopeful that we can find a way to support each other through this transition.

Therapist: : That's a very positive and proactive approach, Samantha. Having a financial advisor can indeed provide valuable guidance and support. Let's continue to work on refining your communication and building a supportive relationship with your parents.
