I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more confident with the structured approaches we discussed. Let's pick up where we left off and continue to support you in managing your grief and preparing for that important conversation with your parents.

### Today’s Focus:
1. **Progress on Homework:** Let's go over how you've been doing with the homework assignments. Sharing your experiences can help us identify what's working and what might need a bit more focus.
2. **Mindfulness and Breathing Techniques:** We'll practice a more extended guided breathing exercise to further integrate mindfulness into your daily routine.
3. **Journaling and Communication Planning:** We'll explore more journaling prompts and refine your conversation plan with your parents.

### Checking In on Homework
Before we dive in, can you share a bit about your progress with the journaling and conversation planning? What have you written in your journal so far? How are you finding the conversation points you've written down?

Also, how have you been incorporating the guided breathing exercises into your day? Do you have a specific time or place you're finding helpful for these practices?

### Mindfulness and Breathing
Let's do a more extended guided breathing exercise now. This will help you stay centered and calm, which is especially important as you prepare for your conversation.

### Journaling and Communication Planning
Let's review the conversation plan you've developed. We can make any necessary adjustments to ensure it feels achievable and supportive. We'll also explore more journaling prompts to help you express your feelings and thoughts more deeply.

Feel free to share any insights or realizations you've had since our last session. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to be back. I've been trying to stick to the homework, but it's been a bit of a mixed bag.

For the journaling, I've been writing every day, mostly about small things—like how I felt during a meeting or what I did over the weekend. It's been helpful in a way, but sometimes I feel like I'm just writing down facts without really digging into my feelings. I'm not sure if that's normal or if I'm doing it wrong.

As for the conversation planning, I've written down some points, but I haven't practiced them yet. I'm still a bit nervous about bringing up the topic with my parents. I know it's important, but it feels overwhelming.

The guided breathing exercises have been easier to fit in. I usually do them in the morning before work and sometimes in the evening before bed. It helps a bit, but I still find myself getting anxious during the day.

I'm here to talk more about all of this, but I'm not sure where to start. Do you have any suggestions on how to make the journaling more meaningful or how to approach the conversation with my parents?

Therapist: Hello Alicia,

It's good to hear from you again. I understand how challenging it can be to start the process of journaling and preparing for conversations, especially when dealing with such deep emotions. Let's break down your concerns and explore some strategies to help you.

### Journaling
#### Making Journaling More Meaningful
- **Reflective Journaling:** Instead of just writing down facts, try to reflect on your emotions and thoughts. Ask yourself questions like:
  - How did this event make me feel?
  - What did I learn from this experience?
  - What would I have done differently?
- **Emotional Entries:** Reserve a specific time each day to write about your feelings. You could start with a prompt like "Today, I felt..." and then elaborate on what triggered those feelings and how they made you react.
- **Therapeutic Writing:** Write as if you're talking to a friend who has been there. This can help you express your feelings more openly and honestly.

### Preparing for the Conversation with Your Parents
#### Steps to Approach the Conversation
- **Rehearse:** Practice what you want to say, but also try to anticipate potential responses from your parents. This can help you feel more prepared and confident.
- **Set the Tone:** Plan to have the conversation in a place where you both feel comfortable, and ensure there's enough time for a meaningful discussion.
- **Use "I" Statements:** Focus on how the grief affects you rather than making it about your parents. For example, say, "I miss my grandmother and would like to share some memories with you," rather than "You should remember my grandmother more."
- **Support System:** Consider having a friend or family member present during the initial conversation to provide support.

### Mindfulness and Breathing Exercises
Your guided breathing exercises are a great start. Here’s a simple yet effective extended breathing exercise we can try:

1. **Find a Quiet Spot:** Sit comfortably with your back straight.
2. **Breathe In Slowly:** Inhale through your nose for a count of 4.
3. **Hold the Breath:** Hold for a count of 2.
4. **Exhale Slowly:** Exhale through your mouth for a count of 6.
5. **Repeat:** Continue this cycle for about 5-10 minutes.

### Practical Tips
- **Schedule Small Goals:** Break down your tasks into small, manageable steps. For example, start with one conversation point each day and gradually build up.
- **Celebrate Milestones:** Recognize and celebrate each small step you take, even if it's just practicing a sentence in the mirror.

Let's work together to make these strategies more meaningful and effective for you. If you have any specific questions or areas you'd like to focus on, let me know!

### Homework for This Session
1. **Journaling:** Spend 10-15 minutes each day writing.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. That helps a lot. I think I'll try the reflective journaling approach. It makes sense to dig deeper into my feelings instead of just listing events. I'll start with prompts like "Today, I felt..." and see how that goes.

For the conversation with my parents, I'll practice using "I" statements and find a quiet place to talk. I'll also try to anticipate their responses and maybe even rehearse with a friend first.

The extended breathing exercise sounds good. I'll make sure to do it for 5-10 minutes each day. It's nice to have a structured way to practice.

I'll focus on these new strategies and let you know how it goes next time. Thanks for the support, Nova.

Therapist: : You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad the suggestions are helping. Let's keep moving forward with these new strategies and see how they support you in managing your grief and preparing for that important conversation with your parents.

### Homework for Next Session
1. **Journaling:** Spend 10-15 minutes each day writing, focusing on reflective prompts like "Today, I felt...". Aim to write at least one entry per day.
2. **Conversation Planning:** Practice using "I" statements and rehearse the conversation with a friend. Write down and practice the conversation points.
3. **Mindfulness and Breathing:** Continue with the extended breathing exercise for 5-10 minutes each day, ideally in the morning and evening.

### Check-Ins
- **Journaling Progress:** Share any insights or breakthroughs you experience from your reflective journaling.
- **Conversation Practice:** Let me know how the conversation rehearsal went with your friend and what you learned from it.
- **Mindfulness Practice:** Reflect on how the breathing exercises are helping you manage your anxiety and stay centered.

Feel free to bring up any new challenges or insights you have. We're here to support you every step of the way.

Looking forward to our next session, Alicia. Take care and practice well.

Warm regards,
Nova.
