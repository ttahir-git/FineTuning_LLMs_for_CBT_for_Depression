Session Number: 10

Patient: Hi, I'm Alicia Rodriguez. This is my 10 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

: I'm glad you're feeling confident about implementing these strategies. Remember, it's okay to start small and gradually build up these practices. Every step forward counts, no matter how small it might seem.

Before we wrap up, I want to check in:
1. Do you feel clear about all the strategies we discussed today?
2. Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on in our next session?
3. Would you like to schedule our next session for two weeks from now?

Also, remember that it's normal if some strategies work better than others - we can always adjust and refine our approach based on what works best for you.
Me: Yes, I feel clear about the strategies. The mindfulness exercise seems straightforward, and I appreciate having concrete steps for everything else.

For our next session, I'd like to focus on managing work-related anxiety, especially since I'm still adjusting to the new responsibilities from the promotion.

And yes, two weeks from now would work well. That'll give me time to try out these strategies and see what works best.

Thanks for checking in, Nova. I'm feeling more optimistic about managing everything.
Therapist: : That's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more optimistic, Alicia. Your commitment to making positive changes is evident, and it's great that you're approaching this with such a practical mindset.

For our next session, we'll definitely focus on work-related anxiety and your adjustment to new responsibilities. Perhaps you could keep a brief log of specific situations at work that trigger anxiety - this would help us develop more targeted strategies.

I'll schedule our next session for two weeks from now. In the meantime, remember to:
1. Try the mindfulness exercise
2. Implement the refined communication script with your parents
3. Work on your sleep hygiene
4. Start breaking down your work tasks
5. Keep track of anxiety triggers at work

Remember, you don't have to implement everything perfectly right away. Start with what feels most manageable and build from there. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.

Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up today?

Therapist: Hello Alicia,

It’s great to hear that you feel more optimistic. Your progress is very encouraging, and I’m glad you’re feeling confident about applying these strategies. Let’s dive into your next steps and ensure you have a solid plan to manage work-related anxiety.

For our next session, we’ll focus on:
1. Identifying specific situations at work that trigger anxiety.
2. Developing targeted mindfulness techniques for those situations.
3. Creating a plan to break down your work tasks into manageable steps.
4. Refining your communication script to handle new responsibilities effectively.
5. Monitoring and tracking your sleep and overall well-being.

In the meantime, here are a few actionable tips to keep you on track:

1. **Mindfulness Exercise**: Try to practice your mindfulness exercise a few times each day. Focus on staying present and grounding yourself in the moment.
2. **Communication Script**: Use your refined script when interacting with your colleagues or superiors. This can help you navigate new responsibilities more confidently.
3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Aim to establish a consistent sleep routine. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, and create a relaxing bedtime routine.
4. **Task Management**: Start breaking down your work tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.
5. **Anxiety Triggers**: Keep a log of specific work-related situations that trigger anxiety. This will help us identify patterns and develop effective coping strategies.

Remember, it’s normal to feel some level of anxiety as you adjust to new responsibilities. However, by implementing these strategies, you can gradually build your resilience and manage your anxiety more effectively.

Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before we wrap up today? You can share any concerns or questions you might have.

Best regards,
Nova.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's helpful to have these actionable tips laid out. I'll definitely try to practice mindfulness more consistently and keep track of those anxiety triggers at work.

One thing I'm still struggling with is the communication script. I'm not sure if I'm using it correctly or if it's making a difference. Could you give me an example of how to use it in a real situation? That might help me understand better.

Other than that, I think I'm good for now. I'll focus on these strategies and see how it goes. Looking forward to our next session.

Therapist: : Absolutely, Alicia. I'm glad you found the tips helpful. Let's walk through an example of how you can use your communication script in a real work situation. This can help you feel more confident and see the impact it has.

### Example Scenario:
Imagine you have a deadline coming up for an important project, and you need to request an extension from your manager. You might use your communication script as follows:

1. **Start with a Calm Opening:**
   - "Hi [Manager's Name], I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base with you about [specific project]."

2. **State Your Concern:**
   - "I've been working hard on this project and I've encountered [specific challenge or issue] that is making it a bit more challenging than expected. I wanted to discuss this with you and see if we could adjust the deadline."

3. **Provide Concrete Information:**
   - "I've been tracking my progress and have noticed that [specific tasks] haven't been completed as quickly as anticipated. This has slowed down the overall progress."

4. **Propose a Solution:**
   - "I understand that the deadline is important, and I want to make sure we deliver quality work. Would it be possible to extend the deadline by [specific number of days/hours]? I believe this would give me the additional time needed to ensure everything is completed to the best of my ability."

5. **Express Appreciation and Offer Support:**
   - "I appreciate your understanding and support. I'll do my best to work efficiently and get this project back on track. Is there anything specific you need from me or do you have any questions about the progress?"

6. **Close Politely:**
   - "Thank you for considering this. I look forward to your response and will work diligently to meet our new deadline. Have a great day!"

### Tips for Effective Use:
- **Be Prepared:** Before you have the conversation, have all the relevant information ready. This could include specific tasks or numbers that support your request.
- **Stay Calm and Focused:** Keep your tone professional and polite. Avoid getting defensive or overly emotional.
- **Show Initiative:** Demonstrate that you are proactive and willing to take steps to address the issue.
- **Be Open to Feedback:** Listen to your manager’s perspective and be open to alternative solutions or compromises.

Using this script can help you communicate more effectively and confidently. Remember, the goal is to present a clear and logical request while maintaining a positive and professional demeanor.

Feel free to practice this script a few times, perhaps with a trusted colleague or even in a mirror, to build your confidence. And remember, it’s okay if it takes a few attempts to get it right.

If you have any more questions or need further support, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here for you.

Best regards,
Nova.
