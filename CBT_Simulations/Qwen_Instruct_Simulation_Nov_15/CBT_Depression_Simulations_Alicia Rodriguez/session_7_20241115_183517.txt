Therapist: : Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again. Thank you for providing that summary. Let's dive right in and pick up where we left off. You mentioned that you have an upcoming conversation with your parents, and you're feeling a mix of anxiety and anticipation. How are you feeling right now as we start this session?

From our last session, you've been doing well with using "I" statements, taking breaks, and practicing breathing exercises. Today, we can focus on refining these techniques and possibly exploring some new strategies to help you manage your emotions during this conversation. 

Would you like to start by sharing any specific concerns or anxieties you have about the upcoming conversation? Or perhaps you'd prefer to practice some of the techniques we discussed last time?

Patient: I'm feeling a bit nervous about the conversation with my parents, to be honest. I know it's important, but the thought of discussing my emotional struggles and setting boundaries is overwhelming. I'm worried they might not understand or might react negatively.

I've been practicing the breathing exercises, and they help a little, but I still feel a lot of anxiety building up as the conversation gets closer. I think practicing some of the techniques we discussed last time would be helpful, especially the "I" statements and validation statements. Maybe we could go over some examples or role-play a bit?

Therapist: : Hi Alicia, thank you for sharing those feelings. It's completely normal to feel nervous about such a significant conversation, especially when it involves discussing your emotional well-being and setting boundaries. Let's start by refining the techniques we discussed last time and see how we can apply them in a role-play scenario.

First, let's go over the "I" statements and validation statements. "I" statements help you express your feelings and needs without blaming or accusing, while validation statements acknowledge your parents' feelings and concerns. Here are a few examples:

1. **"I" Statements:**
   - "I feel really overwhelmed when we talk about my emotions because I worry that I'm not being understood."
   - "I need some space to process my feelings, and I hope we can find a way to make that work for us."

2. **Validation Statements:**
   - "I understand that you're concerned about me, and I appreciate your worry."
   - "I can see that this is a sensitive topic, and I want to make sure we handle it with care and respect."

Now, let's practice a bit. Imagine a scenario where you're starting the conversation with your parents. How would you begin using these statements? Maybe we can start with a brief introduction and then move into discussing your feelings and needs.

Would you like to give it a try? We can role-play the conversation, and I can play the part of your parent, and you can practice speaking. This will help you feel more prepared and confident.

Patient: Sure, I can give it a try. Let's start with the introduction.

"Mom, Dad, I wanted to talk to you about something important. I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately, and I think it's affecting my well-being. I understand that you're concerned about me, and I appreciate your worry. I need some space to process my feelings, and I hope we can find a way to make that work for us."

Now, let's move into discussing my feelings and needs.

"I feel really overwhelmed when we talk about my emotions because I worry that I'm not being understood. I need to set some boundaries to ensure that I can take care of myself while still maintaining our relationship. I hope you can understand and support me in this."

How does that sound?

Therapist: : That sounds like a great start, Alicia. Let's break it down a bit more to ensure you feel confident and prepared.

1. **Introduction:**
   - "Mom, Dad, I wanted to talk to you about something important. I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately, and I think it's affecting my well-being. I understand that you're concerned about me, and I appreciate your worry."

2. **Discussing Your Feelings:**
   - "I feel really overwhelmed when we talk about my emotions because I worry that I'm not being understood. I need to share my feelings with you in a way that feels safe for me."

3. **Discussing Your Needs:**
   - "I need some space to process my feelings, and I hope we can find a way to make that work for us. I also need your support in setting some boundaries so that I can take care of myself while still maintaining our relationship. I hope you can understand and support me in this."

Now, let's practice this together. You can start with the introduction, and then we can move into the more specific parts. Hereâ€™s how it might look:

**Practice Scenario:**

*You:* "Mom, Dad, I wanted to talk to you about something important. I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately, and I think it's affecting my well-being. I understand that you're concerned about me, and I appreciate your worry."

*Mom:* "Oh, Alicia, we're really worried too. What's been going on?"

*You:* "I feel really overwhelmed when we talk about my emotions because I worry that I'm not being understood. I need to share my feelings with you in a way that feels safe for me."

*Mom:* "That sounds hard, Alicia. Can you tell us more about how you're feeling?"

*You:* "I need some space to process my feelings, and I hope we can find a way to make that work for us. I also need your support in setting some boundaries so that I can take care of myself while still maintaining our relationship. I hope you can understand and support me in this."

*Mom/Dad:* "We want to support you, Alicia. Can you explain more about the boundaries you need?"

*You:* "Certainly. I need to have some time alone to process my emotions without feeling judged or criticized. I also need to be able to communicate my feelings without feeling like I'm burdening you. I hope you can understand and support me in this."

Would you like to try this practice scenario, or do you have any additional questions or concerns before we move forward?

Session Summary:

Your response shows good use of both "I" statements and validation statements. You've managed to express your needs clearly while acknowledging your parents' perspective. Let me play the role of a parent to help you practice handling different responses:

"Honey, we're just worried about you. Why haven't you talked to us about this before? We're your parents - we should be able to help you with everything. Maybe if you spent more time with family instead of needing 'space,' you wouldn't feel so overwhelmed."

This is a common type of response that can feel invalidating. How would you respond while maintaining your boundaries and staying calm? Remember to use your breathing techniques if you feel anxious, and try to keep using "I" statements even if the conversation becomes challenging.

What would you say next?
