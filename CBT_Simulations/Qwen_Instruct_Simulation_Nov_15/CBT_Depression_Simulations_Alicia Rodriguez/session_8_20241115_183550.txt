Session Number: 8

Patient: Hi, I'm Alicia Rodriguez. This is my 8 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

Your response shows good use of both "I" statements and validation statements. You've managed to express your needs clearly while acknowledging your parents' perspective. Let me play the role of a parent to help you practice handling different responses:

"Honey, we're just worried about you. Why haven't you talked to us about this before? We're your parents - we should be able to help you with everything. Maybe if you spent more time with family instead of needing 'space,' you wouldn't feel so overwhelmed."

This is a common type of response that can feel invalidating. How would you respond while maintaining your boundaries and staying calm? Remember to use your breathing techniques if you feel anxious, and try to keep using "I" statements even if the conversation becomes challenging.

What would you say next?

Therapist: Hello, Ms. Rodriguez. It's great to see you again. Let's continue where we left off. When discussing your feelings with your parents, it's important to stay focused on your needs and boundaries. Here’s how you might respond:

"I understand that you and my parents are worried about me and want to help. However, what I need is some space to navigate my challenges independently. I feel overwhelmed when I don't communicate my boundaries clearly. Maybe we could set up regular check-ins where I can share updates, but also discuss how they can support me without taking away my autonomy. I appreciate their concern, but I believe it's important for me to find my own solutions."

This response maintains your boundaries while showing appreciation for your parents' concern. It also suggests a way forward that respects both your needs and theirs. If you feel anxious, take a few deep breaths before responding to help stay calm and composed.

Patient: Hi, Nova. Thanks for the example. It helps to see how I can respond without feeling like I'm shutting them out completely. I've been trying to practice that kind of response, but it's still tough. 

I've noticed that since our last session, I've been feeling a bit more anxious at work. The promotion has been a lot more demanding than I expected, and I'm finding it hard to balance everything. I've been staying late to review code and take on extra projects, but it's not really helping. I end up feeling more drained and less productive. 

I've also been having trouble sleeping again. I keep waking up in the middle of the night, and when I finally do fall back asleep, I feel groggy and unfocused the next day. It's making it hard to concentrate during meetings, and I've made a few mistakes that I never would have made before.

Therapist: Hello, Ms. Rodriguez. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety, not just at home but also at work. It's important to acknowledge the challenges you're facing and recognize that they're valid concerns. Let's break down how you might address these issues both at work and in your personal life.

First, regarding your work situation, it's crucial to find a balance and communicate effectively with your colleagues and superiors. Here’s an example of how you might address this:

"I've been feeling quite overwhelmed with the demands of the promotion. I know the extra projects and long hours are expected, but I think we need to find a better way to manage my workload. Perhaps we can re-prioritize some tasks and delegate some responsibilities. Additionally, I need to take better care of myself to avoid burnout. I’ve been staying late to review code and take on extra projects, but it’s not really helping. I need to find a more sustainable way to manage my work and ensure I'm not compromising my health and productivity."

Next, let's talk about your sleep issues. It's important to establish a consistent routine to help regulate your sleep. Here’s how you might address this with your family:

"I’ve been having trouble sleeping again, waking up in the middle of the night and feeling groggy in the morning. I know this is affecting my work and concentration. I’ve been staying up late to do work, but it’s making things worse. I think we need to establish a routine to help me sleep better. I’ve read that having a consistent bedtime, avoiding screens before bed, and creating a calming environment can help. I’d like to start implementing these changes and see if it helps."

Remember to take care of yourself and communicate your needs effectively. If you feel anxious or overwhelmed, take a few deep breaths or pause to reflect before responding. Your well-being is important, and addressing these challenges head-on can help you manage stress more effectively.
