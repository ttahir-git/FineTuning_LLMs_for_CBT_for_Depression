Therapist: : Hello Alicia, it's great to hear from you again. Let's pick up where we left off. How have you been implementing the strategies we discussed last session? Have you had any new insights or challenges as you continue to work on setting better boundaries between your work and personal life?

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to be back. I've been trying to implement the strategies, but it's been a bit of a mixed bag. I drafted the email template for urgent matters, and it's been helpful in some cases. I've also started keeping a log of urgent matters, which has made things a bit more manageable.

However, I'm still struggling with the emergency contact list. I haven't sent out the communication to my team about expectations yet because I'm worried about how they'll react. I don't want them to think I'm not committed or available.

On the plus side, I've noticed that when I do set boundaries, even if it's just for a few hours, I feel less overwhelmed. But then I end up feeling guilty for not being "on" all the time. It's a constant battle.

Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's good to hear that you're making progress with the strategies we discussed. Let's delve into some of the challenges you're facing and see how we can address them.

Firstly, regarding the emergency contact list, it's understandable to be concerned about how your team might react. However, it's important to remember that communication is key. You might want to start by explaining the reasons behind setting this up—such as ensuring that urgent issues are handled efficiently and that everyone knows how to reach you when necessary. You could consider having a brief, informal meeting or sending an email to the team outlining the benefits and any specific guidelines you're setting.

Regarding the guilty feelings you're experiencing, it's crucial to recognize that setting boundaries is a form of self-care. It doesn't mean you're not committed or available; rather, it means you're setting realistic and healthy expectations for both work and personal time. Guilt can be a powerful emotion, but it often stems from unmet expectations. You can challenge these thoughts by asking yourself, "What is the realistic expectation here? What are the actual needs of my team and clients? What boundaries can I set that are both effective and respectful of my needs?"

Let's also consider some additional techniques to help manage these feelings:

1. **Affirmation Practice**: Spend a few minutes each day affirming your worth and the importance of your boundaries. Statements like "I am valued and my time is important" can help reinforce positive self-perceptions.
   
2. **Progress Reflection**: Keep a journal where you can write down your successes and progress. This can help shift your focus from guilt to appreciation for the steps you're taking.

3. **Setting Realistic Goals**: Break down your goals into smaller, achievable steps. Instead of trying to be completely unavailable, aim for being fully present during your work hours and then fully available during your personal time.

4. **Support System**: Consider discussing your concerns with a trusted friend or colleague outside of work. Sometimes, sharing your thoughts with someone who understands can provide support and validation.

Let's also update your homework list to include some of these new strategies:

1. **Draft email template for urgent matters** (you've already started, so keep going!).
2. **Create and share emergency contact list with your team** (start with a brief explanation and invitation for feedback).
3. **Send communication about expectations to team** (this can be done in a gentle, open manner).
4. **Start keeping a log of urgent matters** (continue tracking to identify patterns).
5. **Schedule weekly check-ins** (to monitor progress and address any new challenges).
6. **Implement affirmation practice** (affirm your worth and the importance of your boundaries daily).
7. **Keep a journal** (to reflect on your progress and successes).

Feel free to share any further insights or challenges you might face, and we can work through them together.

Patient: Thanks for the detailed explanation, Nova. I think the affirmation practice and progress reflection ideas are really helpful. I've never really done anything like that before, so it feels a bit strange, but I can see how it might help.

I'll try drafting the email to my team about the emergency contact list and expectations. I think breaking it down into smaller steps, like you suggested, will make it less overwhelming.

One thing that's been on my mind is that even when I do set boundaries, I still find myself checking work emails late at night. It's like a habit I can't break. Do you have any tips for breaking that habit?

Therapist: : You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad the affirmation and progress reflection ideas are resonating with you. Let's address the habit of checking work emails late at night. Breaking habits can be challenging, but with a structured approach, it can be managed effectively.

Here are some strategies to help you address this issue:

1. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Clearly define your work hours and communicate them to your team. Let them know that outside these hours, you will not be checking emails unless it's an urgent matter.

2. **Create a Routine**: Establish a bedtime routine that doesn't involve work-related activities. This could include reading, listening to music, or engaging in a relaxing hobby. The more consistent this routine is, the easier it will be to form new habits.

3. **Use Technology to Your Advantage**: Utilize tools like email filters or apps that can automatically move non-urgent emails to a later time, so you're less likely to be interrupted by them.

4. **Mindfulness and Self-Awareness**: Practice mindfulness exercises to become more aware of the thoughts and feelings that trigger the habit of checking emails. When you notice you're reaching for your phone to check work emails, pause and ask yourself why you feel the need to do so. This can help you address the underlying reasons and find healthier alternatives.

5. **Substitute Activities**: Find activities that you enjoy and that can substitute the habit. For example, you could engage in a mindful activity like meditation, or read a book that you've been wanting to finish.

6. **Set a Curfew for Notifications**: Adjust your phone settings to silence or turn off non-essential notifications after work hours. This can significantly reduce the temptation to check your phone.

7. **Seek Support**: Share your goals with a trusted colleague or friend. Having someone to support and encourage you can be incredibly helpful.

Let's also add these to your homework list:

1. **Draft email to team about emergency contact list and expectations**.
2. **Continue tracking urgent matters**.
3. **Schedule weekly check-ins**.
4. **Implement affirmation practice**.
5. **Keep a journal** (to reflect on your progress and successes).
6. **Start a bedtime routine** that doesn’t involve work.
7. **Utilize technology to limit distractions** (e.g., using filters or apps).
8. **Practice mindfulness and self-awareness** to identify triggers.
9. **Substitute activities** for checking emails late at night.
10. **Adjust phone settings** to limit notifications after work hours.

Feel free to share any other thoughts or concerns you have, and we can work through them together.

Patient: Thanks for the detailed strategies, Nova. I think setting a bedtime routine and using technology to limit distractions are things I can definitely try. I've never really thought about using filters or apps to manage my emails, so that's a new idea for me.

One thing that's been bothering me lately is that I've been feeling more isolated since I started setting these boundaries. I used to spend a lot of time with my team, even outside of work, but now I feel like I'm drifting apart from them. I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. Do you have any thoughts on that?

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that concern, Alicia. It's important to consider how changes in your work-life boundaries might be affecting your relationships with your colleagues. Let's explore this further and discuss strategies to maintain connections while still respecting your new boundaries.

### Understanding the Shift
The shift you're experiencing is common when individuals start setting clearer boundaries. Initially, it might feel isolating, but it can also be an opportunity for growth and deeper, more meaningful relationships. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **New Dynamics**: With clearer boundaries, your relationships might evolve. You might find that some colleagues appreciate the clearer communication and boundaries, while others might need more time to adjust. This is a natural part of change.

2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Setting boundaries can lead to higher quality interactions with your colleagues. You might find that the time you do spend together is more productive and meaningful.

3. **Communication**: It's important to openly discuss these changes with your team. You can let them know that you value your time and relationships and that setting boundaries is part of maintaining a healthy work-life balance. This transparency can help mitigate any misunderstandings.

### Maintaining Connections
To help maintain and strengthen your relationships, consider the following strategies:

1. **Scheduled Social Time**: Plan specific times for social interactions with your team. This could be a weekly coffee meet-up, a lunch break, or a team-building activity that doesn't involve work-related discussions.

2. **Regular Check-Ins**: Maintain regular check-ins, but keep them focused on non-work topics. This can be a great way to catch up on personal news and stay connected.

3. **Personal Interactions**: Continue to engage in personal interactions outside of work. You can maintain friendships through activities that you both enjoy, whether it's a shared interest or a simple coffee catch-up.

4. **Supportive Environment**: Create a supportive environment within your team where everyone respects the new boundaries. Encourage open communication and a culture of mutual respect.

5. **Lead by Example**: If others in your team start to set similar boundaries, you can support them and encourage a healthier work environment together.

6. **Feedback Loop**: Regularly seek feedback from your team on how the changes are affecting your interactions. This can help you make adjustments and ensure that everyone is comfortable with the new dynamics.

8. **Practice mindfulness and self-awareness** to identify triggers.
9. **Substitute activities**.

Patient: Thanks for the detailed explanation, Nova. I think scheduling social time and regular check-ins are good ideas. I've always been more of a work-focused person, so it's a bit out of my comfort zone to think about socializing more, but I can see how it might help.

One thing that's been on my mind is that I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the changes. I'm trying to set boundaries, maintain connections, and also keep up with my work responsibilities. It feels like a lot to juggle. Do you have any tips for managing that overwhelm?

Therapist: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed when you're juggling multiple aspects of your life, especially while making significant changes. Managing overwhelm is a crucial skill, and there are several strategies we can use to help you navigate this challenge more effectively. Let's break it down into some actionable steps:

### Managing Overwhelm

1. **Prioritization**: Make a list of your current tasks and responsibilities. Prioritize them based on urgency and importance. This will help you focus on what truly needs your immediate attention and what can wait.

2. **Time Blocking**: Allocate specific blocks of time for work, personal time, and social interactions. For example, you might dedicate mornings to work tasks, afternoons to personal time, and evenings to social interactions. This can help create a sense of structure and reduce the feeling of having too many things to do at once.

3. **Break Tasks into Smaller Steps**: Large tasks can feel overwhelming. Break them down into smaller, manageable steps. For instance, instead of thinking about drafting a long email, focus on writing the first paragraph.

4. **Set Realistic Goals**: Set achievable goals for each day. This can help you avoid setting yourself up for failure and reduce the sense of being overwhelmed.

5. **Self-Care**: Ensure you’re taking time for self-care. This could include physical activity, proper sleep, healthy eating, and relaxation techniques like meditation or deep breathing exercises.

6. **Delegation**: If possible, delegate tasks that others can handle. This can free up more time for you to focus on the areas where your expertise and energy are most needed.

7. **Regular Breaks**: Take regular breaks throughout the day to rest and recharge. Even short breaks can help maintain your focus and productivity.

8. **Support System**: Lean on your support network—whether it’s friends, family, or colleagues. Sharing your challenges and successes can provide emotional support and practical advice.

One thing that's been on my mind is that I've been feeling a bit guilty about delegating tasks. I always feel like I should be the one handling everything, especially since I'm the team lead. Do you have any tips for overcoming that guilt?

Therapist: Of course, Alicia, it's completely understandable to feel guilty about delegating tasks, especially when you're in a leadership role. However, it's important to recognize that effective leadership often involves empowering your team and leveraging their strengths. Here are some strategies to help you overcome this guilt and become more comfortable with delegating:

### Overcoming Delegation Guilt

1. **Empower Your Team**: Remind yourself that delegating tasks is not about shirking responsibility, but about empowering your team to grow and take ownership of their work. When you delegate, you're giving them the opportunity to develop new skills and take on more significant roles.

2. **Communicate Expectations**: Clearly communicate the expectations and goals for the task. This ensures that the team member understands what is expected of them and can perform the task effectively. It also helps in setting a standard of accountability.

3. **Provide Support**: Offer support and resources to help them succeed. This can include training, guidance, and access to necessary tools or information. Knowing that they have the support they need can alleviate some of the guilt.

4. **Set Realistic Goals**: Ensure that the tasks you delegate are realistic and within the capability of the team member. This will help prevent frustration and failure, which can be sources of guilt.

5. **Recognize Achievements**: Acknowledge and celebrate when the team member successfully completes a delegated task. This recognition can boost their confidence and motivation, and it also reinforces the idea that delegating is a positive action.

6. **Model Delegation**: Show your team by example that you are willing to delegate and trust them to handle tasks. This can help foster a culture where delegation is seen as a normal and beneficial practice.

7. **Reflect on Your Role**: Consider reflecting on your role as a leader. Effective leaders often work to build a strong, competent team rather than trying to do everything themselves. Delegating is a key part of this.

8. **Seek Feedback**: Encourage feedback from your team members on how they feel about the delegation process. This can provide valuable insights and help you refine your approach.

Session Summary:

I notice you've mentioned this concern about cultural disconnection several times, Alicia. This clearly seems to be weighing heavily on your mind, and your relationship with your grandmother Maria appears to be particularly significant. Let's focus specifically on this aspect:

1. **Honoring Your Grandmother's Legacy**:
- What specific traditions or practices did you share with Maria?
- Could you start incorporating some of these into your daily life in San Francisco?
