Session Number: 4

Patient: Hi, I'm Alicia Rodriguez. This is my 4 CBT session. Last time we talked about: Session Summary:

I notice you've repeated your message several times. It seems like you might be looking for additional guidance or reassurance. Let me provide a focused response to help you move forward.

For our next session, I suggest we:

1. Review how the conversation with your parents went (if you've had it)
2. Discuss any challenges or successes you've experienced
3. Adjust our strategies based on what worked and what didn't
4. Explore any new concerns or questions you might have

Would you like to share any specific concerns about the upcoming conversation with your parents that we haven't addressed yet? Or would you prefer to focus on a different aspect of your grief journey?

Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to hear from you again. I haven't had the conversation with my parents yet, but I've been thinking a lot about how to approach it. I'm a bit nervous about saying what I need to say and I'm worried they might not understand. I also feel a bit stuck in my grief and I'm not sure how to move forward from here.

Let's focus on these concerns. How can we best prepare for the conversation and also work on managing these feelings of being stuck in my grief?

Patient: Hi, Nova. Thanks for understanding. I haven't had the conversation with my parents yet because I'm really nervous about it. I'm worried they might not understand what I'm going through, especially since they've always been so focused on my success. I don't want to disappoint them or make them worry more.

As for feeling stuck in my grief, it's like I can't move past the loss of my grandmother. I keep thinking about her and how much I miss her, but I don't know how to start healing. It feels like I'm just going through the motions at work and in life, but nothing really feels meaningful anymore. I'm not sure how to start moving forward.

Therapist: Hello Alicia, thank you for sharing these concerns with me. It's completely understandable to feel nervous and stuck in your grief, especially after the loss of a loved one. Let’s work through these feelings step by step.

### Preparing for the Conversation with Your Parents
1. **Emotional Preparation**: It’s important to acknowledge and validate your feelings. Recognize that it’s natural to feel anxious about discussing such personal matters. We can work on strategies to manage these feelings, such as deep breathing exercises or a brief mindfulness session before you have the conversation.
2. **Communication Plan**: Write down what you want to say. This can help you stay focused and ensure you cover all the points you want to make. It might also help you feel more prepared and confident.
3. **Expressing Your Feelings**: Prepare to explain how your grandmother’s loss has affected you. You might say something like, “I’ve been going through a lot since my grandmother passed away, and I’ve been feeling very sad and overwhelmed. I wanted to talk to you about how I’m feeling and see if you can support me in any way.”

### Managing Feelings of Being Stuck in Grief
1. **Acknowledge and Validate Your Emotions**: Grief is a process, and it's normal to feel stuck at times. Let’s explore why you might be feeling this way. We can work on identifying specific moments that trigger these feelings and find healthier ways to cope.
2. **Set Small Goals**: Break down your healing process into small, manageable steps. For example, you could start by setting a goal to engage in a small, meaningful activity each day that honors your grandmother’s memory.
3. **Mindfulness and Self-Care**: Engage in activities that help you stay present and grounded. This could be as simple as taking a walk in nature, practicing mindfulness meditation, or writing in a journal.
4. **Professional Support**: If you find it too difficult to manage on your own, it might be helpful to speak with a professional counselor or join a support group where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences.

Let’s focus on your communication plan and emotional preparation first. Once we have a solid plan, we can work on the next steps to help you move forward with your grief. Are you ready to start on a plan for your conversation with your parents?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the detailed steps. Let's start with the communication plan for talking to my parents. I think writing down what I want to say will really help. I can start by explaining how much I miss my grandmother and how her loss has affected me. I'll also mention that I've been feeling overwhelmed and could use their support.

As for managing my grief, I think setting small goals is a good idea. Maybe I can start by doing something small each day that reminds me of her, like cooking one of her favorite dishes or visiting a place we used to go together.

I'm still a bit unsure about mindfulness and self-care. Can you give me an example of a mindfulness exercise that might help me stay grounded? I'm not really familiar with these techniques.

Therapist: : Absolutely, Alicia. Let’s break down the steps and provide some practical guidance to help you prepare for your conversation with your parents and manage your grief.

### Preparing for the Conversation with Your Parents
1. **Write Down What You Want to Say**: Start by writing a brief outline or script. Here’s a template you can use:
   - Introduce yourself and the reason for the conversation.
   - Express your feelings about your grandmother and how you’ve been affected by her loss.
   - Mention your specific needs for support, if any.
   - Thank them for their time and understanding.

2. **Practice the Conversation**: If possible, practice your conversation with a trusted friend or family member. This can help you feel more confident and prepared.

### Managing Your Grief
1. **Set Small Goals**: Break down your healing process into small, manageable steps. For example:
   - Day 1: Cook one of your grandmother’s favorite dishes.
   - Day 2: Visit a place you both used to go.
   - Day 3: Write a letter to your grandmother, sharing your thoughts and feelings.

2. **Mindfulness and Self-Care**: Mindfulness is a technique that involves paying attention to the present moment in a non-judgmental way. Here’s a simple mindfulness exercise you can try:

#### Guided Breathing Exercise

**Steps:**
1. Find a comfortable and quiet place to sit or lie down.
2. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.
3. Focus on your breath, feeling the air as it enters and leaves your body.
4. When your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your breathing.
5. Try to maintain this focus for 5 minutes.

**Benefits:**
- Helps to calm your mind and reduce feelings of anxiety.
- Enhances your ability to stay present and grounded.

### Example Script for Your Conversation with Your Parents
Here’s an example of what you might say:

---

**Alicia:**
"Hi, Mom and Dad. I wanted to talk to you about something that’s been on my mind. I miss my grandmother so much and her passing has really affected me. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed and I want to share how I’m coping with this. I understand that you’ve always been focused on my success, but I also want your support during this time. I would appreciate it if you could listen and offer any comfort or advice you might have. Thank you for your time."

### Additional Tips
- **Journaling**: Writing about your feelings can be therapeutic and help you process them.
- **Support System**: Reach out to friends or family members who can support you.
- **Professional Help**: If you continue to feel stuck or overwhelmed, consider speaking with a therapist or joining a support group.

Let’s start with the guided breathing exercise and then we can discuss your conversation.

Patient: Thanks for the detailed plan, Nova. I think writing down what I want to say to my parents will really help. I'll start with that and practice it a few times before I talk to them.

As for the mindfulness exercise, I'll try the guided breathing exercise you suggested. It sounds simple enough, and I can do it before I talk to my parents to help calm my nerves.

I'll also start setting small goals to honor my grandmother's memory. Cooking her favorite dish and visiting a place we used to go together sound like good places to start.

I'm still a bit unsure about journaling. Can you give me an example of what I might write in a journal? I'm not really sure how to start.

### Next Steps

1. **Journaling**: Continue to write in your journal daily, even if it’s just a few sentences. Reflecting on your feelings and memories can be incredibly therapeutic.
