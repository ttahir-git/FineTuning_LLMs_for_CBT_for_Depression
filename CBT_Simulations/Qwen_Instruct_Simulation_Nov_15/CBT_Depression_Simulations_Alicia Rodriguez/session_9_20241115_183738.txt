None explicitly assigned in this portion of the session, though there appears to be ongoing work on boundary-setting with parents.

The session reveals escalating anxiety symptoms affecting multiple areas of the client's life (work, sleep, family relationships) that may need to be addressed more comprehensively.

Therapist: : Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again. It seems we've made a lot of progress since our last session, especially in understanding how your work-related anxiety, sleep difficulties, and boundary-setting with parents are interconnected.

Could you tell me a bit more about how you've been managing your work-related anxiety since our last session? Have you had any opportunities to practice the script we discussed for setting boundaries with your parents? And how have your sleep patterns been lately?

Let's also discuss if there are any specific strategies you've found helpful in dealing with anxiety at work. Additionally, we can explore some more techniques to improve your sleep and see if there are adjustments you can make to your work habits to ensure they are sustainable and less stressful.

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to see you too.

Regarding work-related anxiety, it's been a mixed bag. I've tried to use the deep breathing technique during some stressful meetings, and it helped a bit, but I still find myself overworking to avoid thinking about other things. The promotion has been both a blessing and a curse—more responsibility, more pressure.

As for the script for setting boundaries with my parents, I haven't had the chance to use it yet. We've been communicating mostly through texts, and it feels a bit awkward to bring up boundaries over text. I need to find a good time for a phone call or video chat.

Sleep has been erratic. Some nights I manage to get a few hours, but others, like last night, I was up until 3 AM coding. It's a vicious cycle—the less I sleep, the more anxious I get, and the more anxious I get, the harder it is to sleep.

I haven't found any specific strategies that have been super helpful yet. I'm open to trying new things, though. Maybe some more concrete examples or techniques could help?

Therapist: : Hi Alicia, thank you for sharing those updates. It's important to acknowledge that managing increased responsibilities and anxiety can be challenging, and it's great that you're being proactive about finding solutions.

Let's break down the areas you mentioned and see how we can address them step by step.

### 1. Work-Related Anxiety
Given the mixed results from the deep breathing technique, we can explore other relaxation strategies that might be more suitable for your situation. Have you tried progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness exercises? These can be particularly effective for managing anxiety during work hours.

### 2. Setting Boundaries with Parents
Since you haven’t had the chance to use the script yet, let's refine it a bit more to make it easier to implement through texts or any communication medium. We can also explore more assertive but polite ways to communicate your needs. Perhaps you could practice the script in a more casual setting first, like during a conversation about a less sensitive topic, to build your confidence.

### 3. Sleep Issues
Sleep is crucial for overall well-being, and it sounds like you're in a vicious cycle. Let's look at some practical steps to improve your sleep:

- **Sleep Hygiene**: Establish a consistent bedtime routine. This could include activities like reading, taking a warm bath, or listening to calming music.
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)**: This is a structured approach to help you change thoughts and behaviors that contribute to insomnia. We can discuss specific components of CBT-I that might be helpful for you.
- **Limiting Screen Time**: Reducing exposure to screens at least an hour before bed can significantly improve sleep quality. Consider using blue light filters or apps that block blue light.
- **Daily Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve sleep, but try to avoid vigorous exercise close to bedtime.

### 4. Adjusting Work Habits
Let's look at how you can create more sustainable work habits:

- **Time Management**: Break down your tasks into manageable chunks and set realistic deadlines. Use tools like planners or digital apps to keep track of your tasks.
- **Setting Clear Boundaries**: While it's important to take on more responsibilities, it's equally important to set clear boundaries to ensure you’re not overextending yourself.
- **Leisure Time**: Make sure to schedule regular breaks and downtime. This can help reduce stress and improve overall productivity.

### Homework for This Session
- Practice the refined script for setting boundaries with your parents. Start with a less sensitive topic and gradually apply it to more challenging situations.
- Try a 15-minute mindfulness or progressive muscle relaxation exercise before bed for the next week.
- Keep a sleep diary to track your sleep patterns and any changes you make in your sleep hygiene.

### Next Steps
Let's schedule a follow-up session in two weeks to review your progress. This will give you time to implement these strategies and we can discuss any adjustments needed. Remember,.

Patient: Thanks for breaking it down, Nova. It helps to have a clear plan.

### 1. Work-Related Anxiety
I haven't tried progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness exercises. Could you give me a quick example of what a mindfulness exercise might look like? I think having something concrete to try would be really helpful.

### 2. Setting Boundaries with Parents
I like the idea of refining the script for texts. Maybe something like, "Hey Mom, I love talking to you, but I need to focus on work right now. Can we catch up later?" It sounds more casual and less confrontational.

### 3. Sleep Issues
I'll definitely work on improving my sleep hygiene. I've been meaning to set up a consistent bedtime routine, but I keep pushing it off. I'll start with a warm bath and some calming music. I'll also try to limit screen time before bed.

### 4. Adjusting Work Habits
I've been struggling with time management, especially with the new responsibilities. I'll try breaking tasks into smaller chunks and using a planner to keep track. I'll also make sure to schedule some leisure time, even if it's just a short walk during lunch.

### Homework for This Session
- I'll practice the refined script for setting boundaries with my parents.
- I'll try a 15-minute mindfulness exercise

Therapist: : : You're very welcome, Alicia. I'm glad you found the strategies helpful and concrete. Let's dive into each area in a bit more detail to ensure you feel confident and supported.

### 1. Work-Related Anxiety
Absolutely, let's go over a simple mindfulness exercise. Here’s an example:

**Mindfulness Exercise: Grounding in the Present Moment**
1. **Find a Comfortable Position:** Sit or lie down in a quiet space.
2. **Focus on Your Breath:** Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it briefly, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body.
3. **Notice Your Body:** Slowly scan your body from head to toe, paying attention to any areas of tension. Notice how your body feels in contact with the chair or the floor.
4. **Bring Attention to Your Surroundings:** Focus on sounds around you, the feel of the air on your skin, or the warmth of the room. Use all your senses to bring yourself into the present moment.

Try doing this for about 5 minutes to start, and gradually increase the time as you get more comfortable with the practice.

### 2. Setting Boundaries with Parents
Your proposed script is a great start. Here’s a slightly refined version:

**Example Script:**
"Mom, I really enjoy our conversations, but I've been feeling quite busy with my new responsibilities at work. I would love to catch up later today or another time that works for you. I appreciate your understanding."

Feel free to adjust it to fit your relationship and comfort level. The key is to be clear, kind, and direct.

### 3. Sleep Issues
Great plan! Here are a few additional tips to enhance your sleep hygiene:

- **Create a Bedtime Routine:** This could include activities like reading, taking a warm bath, or listening to calming music. Aim to do the same things each night to signal to your body that it's time to wind down.
- **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol:** Both can disrupt sleep patterns. Try to avoid these substances, especially in the evenings.
- **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:** Make sure your bedroom is cool, quiet, and dark. Consider using blackout curtains or a white noise machine if needed.
- **Use Sleep Apps:** There are several apps that can help you relax and improve your sleep. Apps like Calm or Headspace can provide guided meditations and sleep stories.

### 4. Adjusting Work Habits
Time management is crucial, and here are some steps to help you get started:

- **Break Down Tasks:** Use a to-do list or a planner to break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Set specific deadlines for each task.
- **Prioritize:** Identify the most important tasks and tackle those first. This can help reduce stress and improve productivity.
- **Schedule Breaks:** Incorporate short breaks into.

Patient: Thanks for the detailed mindfulness exercise, Nova. I'll definitely try that. It sounds simple enough to fit into my workday.

The refined script for my mom is perfect. I think it strikes the right balance between being clear and considerate. I'll start using that.

I'll also work on my sleep hygiene. I've heard about sleep apps before, but I never really looked into them. I'll check out Calm and Headspace.

For work habits, I'll start breaking down tasks and prioritizing them. I've been feeling overwhelmed, so having a clear plan should help.

I'll keep you updated on my progress. Thanks for the support, Nova.

Session Summary:

: I'm glad you're feeling confident about implementing these strategies. Remember, it's okay to start small and gradually build up these practices. Every step forward counts, no matter how small it might seem.

Before we wrap up, I want to check in:
1. Do you feel clear about all the strategies we discussed today?
2. Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on in our next session?
3. Would you like to schedule our next session for two weeks from now?

Also, remember that it's normal if some strategies work better than others - we can always adjust and refine our approach based on what works best for you.
Me: Yes, I feel clear about the strategies. The mindfulness exercise seems straightforward, and I appreciate having concrete steps for everything else.

For our next session, I'd like to focus on managing work-related anxiety, especially since I'm still adjusting to the new responsibilities from the promotion.

And yes, two weeks from now would work well. That'll give me time to try out these strategies and see what works best.

Thanks for checking in, Nova. I'm feeling more optimistic about managing everything.
Therapist: : That's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more optimistic, Alicia. Your commitment to making positive changes is evident, and it's great that you're approaching this with such a practical mindset.

For our next session, we'll definitely focus on work-related anxiety and your adjustment to new responsibilities. Perhaps you could keep a brief log of specific situations at work that trigger anxiety - this would help us develop more targeted strategies.

I'll schedule our next session for two weeks from now. In the meantime, remember to:
1. Try the mindfulness exercise
2. Implement the refined communication script with your parents
3. Work on your sleep hygiene
4. Start breaking down your work tasks
5. Keep track of anxiety triggers at work

Remember, you don't have to implement everything perfectly right away. Start with what feels most manageable and build from there. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.

Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up today?
