Session Number: 1

Patient: Hi, I'm Alicia Rodriguez. This is my first CBT session. I'm here because I've been feeling down lately.

Therapist: Hello Alicia, it’s great to meet you. I’m [Your Name], your CBT therapist. Welcome to our session. It’s completely normal to feel a bit nervous on your first session. Can you tell me a bit more about how you’ve been feeling down? Is there a specific situation or event that triggered these feelings, or has it been a more general sense of sadness?

Patient: Hi, I'm Alicia Rodriguez. This is my first CBT session. I'm here because I've been feeling down lately. Specifically, I think it started after my grandmother passed away three months ago. She was really important to me, and I feel like I lost a big part of my support system. Since then, I've been struggling with work, feeling more tired, and just generally not myself.

Therapist: Hello Alicia, it’s great to meet you. I’m [Your Name], your CBT therapist. Welcome to our session. It’s completely normal to feel a bit nervous on your first session. Can you tell me a bit more about how you’ve been feeling down? Is there a specific situation or event that triggered these feelings, or has it been a more general sense of sadness? You mentioned your grandmother passing away, and how that has affected you. Could you elaborate on how her passing has impacted your daily life and what thoughts or feelings you have about it?

It’s understandable that losing someone close can bring about intense feelings of sadness and loss. How have you been coping with these feelings? Have you found any particular activities or support systems that have helped you during this time?

Patient: Yes, losing my grandmother has been really tough. She was like a second mother to me, especially since my parents were always working when I was growing up. Now, I feel like I'm missing that emotional anchor. At work, I've been pushing myself even harder, trying to stay busy, but it's not really helping. I've also been withdrawing from social activities, like salsa dancing, which I used to love. I haven't really reached out to anyone for support, mostly because I don't want to burden others with my problems.

Also, I want to support you in exploring your feelings further. Sometimes, talking about your experiences can help us understand what might be contributing to your current state. Let’s explore a bit more about how your grandmother’s passing has impacted your daily life and what thoughts or feelings you have about it.

Additionally, it sounds like you’re feeling quite isolated. Have you thought about seeking support from friends, family, or a support group? Sometimes, sharing your feelings with others can provide significant relief and help you feel less alone.

Could you tell me more about why you haven’t reached out to others for support? Are there any specific concerns or fears that might be holding you back?

Patient: I haven't reached out to others because I don't want to seem weak or needy. I've always been the strong one, the one who takes care of things. Plus, I moved to a new city a year ago, so I don't have many close friends here yet. My parents are supportive, but they're back in LA, and it's hard to talk to them about this kind of stuff. They have their own struggles, and I don't want to add to their worries.

Therapist: : Hello Alicia, it’s great to meet you. I’m [Your Name], your CBT therapist. Welcome to our session. It’s completely normal to feel a bit nervous on your first session. Thank you for sharing your experiences with me. Your feelings and struggles are very valid, and it’s important to address them.

Losing your grandmother has clearly been a significant trigger for your current feelings. The sense of loss and the absence of a supportive figure can be overwhelming, especially when you're adjusting to a new city. It’s understandable that you feel like you need to be the strong one, but it’s important to remember that it’s okay to ask for support.

Let’s explore how you can address the feelings of being isolated and the fear of appearing weak or needy. These thoughts are common in times of stress, and they can create a cycle that makes it harder for you to reach out. We can work on challenging these thoughts and finding healthier ways to cope.

You mentioned that you moved to a new city a year ago. This move might have contributed to your current feelings. It can be isolating to be in a new place with limited social connections. However, there are steps you can take to build new connections and find support.

Here are a few suggestions:
1. **Support Groups**: Consider joining a support group for people who have experienced similar losses. This can provide a safe space to share your feelings and learn from others who have been through similar experiences.
2. **Community Involvement**: Engage in community activities or clubs. This could be anything from joining a local salsa dancing group to volunteering at a local charity.
3. **Therapy**: Exploring therapy, either with me or another professional, can be a great way to process your feelings and develop coping strategies.
4. **Connecting with Friends and Family**: Even if you haven’t reached out to your parents recently, it might be helpful to let them know that you’re struggling. They can provide emotional support and remind you that it’s okay to need help.
5. **Mindfulness and Self-Care**: Practices like mindfulness, meditation, or engaging in hobbies can help manage your feelings and reduce stress.

Talking about your feelings and reaching out for support is a sign of strength, not weakness. You don’t have to go through this alone, and there are resources available to help you. Let’s work together to develop a plan that suits your needs and helps you manage these challenging times.

Do you think any of these suggestions resonate with you, or is there anything else you’d like to add?

Patient: Thanks for the suggestions. I think joining a support group could be helpful. I've never done anything like that before, but it might be a good way to meet people who understand what I'm going through. I'll also think about reaching out to my parents; maybe they can help in ways I haven't considered.

Therapist: : You're very welcome, Alicia. Joining a support group can be a great step, and it's wonderful that you're open to trying it. Here are a few things to consider as you take this step:

1. **Research Support Groups**: Look for local support groups that focus on grief and loss. Many communities have grief counseling centers or hospitals that offer such groups.
2. **Online Resources**: If you’re not sure about local options, there are online support groups as well. These can be particularly helpful if you’re moving forward gradually with in-person interactions.
3. **Prepare for the First Meeting**: Think about what you might want to say or share. It’s okay to take it slow and not share everything right away. You can start by introducing yourself and expressing that you’re there to listen and support others.
4. **Set Boundaries**: Remember that you don’t have to disclose everything right away. Take things at your own pace and know that you’re allowed to set your own comfort level.

Regarding reaching out to your parents, it’s great that you’re considering it. Here are a few tips for that conversation:

1. **Choose a Good Time**: Find a time when you both are relaxed and can talk without being rushed.
2. **Express Your Feelings**: Let them know that you’re feeling a lot of sadness and are struggling. Share specific examples of how you’ve been coping and where you’re finding it difficult.
3. **Express Gratitude**: Remind them of the support they’ve given you in the past and how much you appreciate their love and care.
4. **Offer to Discuss Their Well-being**: Since you mentioned that they are going through their own struggles, you could offer to discuss how they are doing as well. This might make the conversation more balanced and less focused on your needs alone.

If you have any specific concerns or need help preparing for these conversations, feel free to discuss them further. We can work on developing a script or exploring different scenarios to help you feel more confident.

Let’s also set some goals for our next session. Perhaps we can start by focusing on practical steps you can take to join a support group and reach out to your parents. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I'll start by looking for local support groups and see if there's anything that fits my schedule. As for talking to my parents, I'll try to find a good time when we're both relaxed. I appreciate the tips; they should help me feel more prepared.

Therapist: : That’s a great plan, Alicia. It’s wonderful that you’re taking these steps to support yourself and reach out for help. Here are a few more tips to ensure you’re as prepared as possible:

### Steps to Join a Support Group:
1. **Research Online**: Use search engines or social media to find local grief support groups.
2. **Check Community Centers**: Many community centers, hospitals, or funeral homes host support groups.
3. **Reach Out**: Contact the organization to get more information about the group, such as meeting times, location, and any required commitments.
4. **Prepare for the First Meeting**: Write down a few things you want to share, even if it’s just a few sentences. This can help you feel more comfortable and focused.

### Steps to Talk to Your Parents:
1. **Choose the Right Time**: Find a quiet and comfortable place to talk, ideally when both of you are not rushed or stressed.
2. **Be Honest and Open**: Share your feelings and how you’ve been coping. It’s important to be honest about your struggles.
3. **Express Gratitude**: Remind them of the support they’ve given you and express your appreciation. This can help create a more positive and supportive conversation.
4. **Be Ready to Listen**: Let them share their feelings and concerns as well. They might have insights or support that can be helpful to you.

### Next Steps:
1. **Set a Goal for the Support Group**: Make a list of the top 3-5 groups you found and choose one to join.
2. **Schedule a Time to Talk**: Pick a specific date and time to have a conversation with your parents.
3. **Prepare a Script**: Write down some key points you want to cover and any questions you might have.

### Action Plan for Our Next Session:
1. **Review Your Progress**: We can discuss the progress you’ve made in joining the support group and preparing to talk to your parents.
2. **Adjust Strategies**: If any challenges arise, we can brainstorm additional strategies to overcome them.
3. **Develop Coping Techniques**: We can work on specific techniques to manage your emotions and stress.

Let’s schedule our next session for a week from now, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Take your time and move at a pace that feels right for you.

Is there anything else you’d like to add before we wrap up this session, or do you have any questions about the steps we’ve discussed?

Patient: No, I think that covers it for now. I'll start looking for support groups and plan to talk to my parents next weekend. I'll keep you updated on how it goes. Thanks for the support, it really helps to have someone to guide me through this.

Therapist: : You're very welcome, Alicia. I’m glad to hear that you feel supported and ready to take these steps. It’s important to move at a pace that feels right for you, and I’m here to guide and support you every step of the way.

Here are a few reminders to keep in mind as you move forward:
- **Take Time to Breathe**: Grief and loss can be overwhelming, and it’s okay to take time for yourself. Engage in activities that help you relax and recharge.
- **Stay Connected**: Even if it feels difficult, try to stay in touch with friends or family members who care about you. Sometimes just sharing a little bit can make a big difference.
- **Keep Me Updated**: If you have any updates, questions, or challenges along the way, don’t hesitate to reach out. We can discuss them in our next session.

Next week, we’ll check in on your progress and address any new challenges or questions you might have. You’re doing great, Alicia, and I believe in your strength and resilience.
