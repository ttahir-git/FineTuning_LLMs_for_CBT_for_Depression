Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again. Let's start by going over where you are currently with your Trello task management system and mindfulness practice. How have you been implementing the daily reminders and pairing mindfulness with your morning routine? Also, how are you progressing with your conversation with Sarah? Any updates or challenges you'd like to share?

Patient: Hello, Nova. I've been trying to stick to the Trello system and morning mindfulness routine, but it's been really hard with all the new responsibilities at work. I added daily reminders to my Trello boards, but I find myself skipping them because I'm so focused on getting through my work. As for mindfulness, I've been doing the five-minute breathing exercises, but sometimes I forget or I'm just too tired from the day.

I did have a conversation with Sarah about the imposter syndrome workshop last week. It was really helpful to hear her perspective, and we plan to meet again this week to discuss it further. The challenge is finding the time and energy to really engage in these conversations when work is so overwhelming. I feel like I'm juggling a lot right now, and it's hard to prioritize these things when there's always something urgent at the office.

Therapist: Hello Alicia, thank you for sharing your progress and challenges. It's great that you're using the Trello system and incorporating mindfulness into your morning routine, even if it's been difficult. Let's break down some strategies to help you manage these challenges better.

1. **Trello Task Management System:**
   - **Prioritization:** Focus on breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can help reduce feelings of being overwhelmed. You might also consider color-coding or categorizing tasks by urgency or importance.
   - **Consistent Reviews:** Try to set aside a specific time each day (even if it's just a few minutes) to review your Trello board. This can help you stay on top of your tasks without it feeling like a major disruption.

2. **Mindfulness Practice:**
   - **Consistency Over Perfection:** Itâ€™s important to remember that the goal isn't perfect consistency but rather a commitment to the practice. Even a few minutes of mindfulness can be beneficial. Consider starting with shorter sessions and gradually increasing the duration.
   - **Routine Integration:** If you're finding it hard to stick to the routine, try to find a different time of the day that works better for you. Maybe you could do a brief mindfulness exercise during a commute or before lunch.

3. **Accountability Partner:**
   - **Structured Meetings:** Plan specific times to meet with Sarah, even if it's just a quick check-in. Structuring the time can help ensure that the meeting happens and provides a sense of commitment.
   - **Supportive Environment:** Make sure your environment is conducive to these meetings. If the workplace is too distracting, consider meeting at a more serene location, perhaps during a break or in a quiet corner of the office.
   - **Progress Tracking:** Keep a log of your conversations and progress with Sarah. This can help you both stay accountable and provide a tangible record of your discussions.

4. **Workplace Juggling:**
   - **Time Management Techniques:** Consider using techniques like the Pomodoro Technique or time blocking to manage your work more effectively. This can help you allocate specific blocks of time for Trello task management and mindfulness.
   - **Boundary Setting:** Communicate your needs to your colleagues and supervisor. Sometimes, simply acknowledging that you need specific time slots for these activities can help reduce pressure.

5. **Self-Compassion:**
   - **Understanding Your Struggles:** It's important to remember that it's okay to have setbacks. Acknowledge that these challenges are a part of the process of forming new habits and growing in self-awareness.

Let's also consider setting some specific goals for this session to help you move forward:

- **Goal for Trello:** Set a specific time each day (e.g., 5 PM) to review and update your Trello board.
- **Goal for Mindfulness:** Try to practice a five-minute breathing exercise at the same time each.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate the detailed strategies. Let's focus on the Trello system first. I think breaking down tasks into smaller chunks and setting specific times to review the board could really help. I'll try to do a quick review at 5 PM each day, as you suggested.

For mindfulness, I understand the importance of consistency over perfection. I'll start with shorter sessions and see if I can integrate it better into my day. Maybe I can try a brief exercise during my lunch break or right after I make my bed in the morning.

As for Sarah, I'll plan specific times to meet with her and keep a log of our conversations. I think having a structured approach will make it easier to stay committed.

I'll also try to use time management techniques like the Pomodoro Technique to better juggle my work responsibilities. Setting boundaries with my colleagues is something I need to work on, but I'll start by communicating my needs more clearly.

Thank you for the support, Nova. I feel a bit more hopeful about managing everything better.

Therapist: : You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad to hear that you feel more hopeful about managing everything better. Let's summarize our plan and set some clear, actionable steps to help you stay on track:

1. **Trello Task Management System:**
   - **Goal:** Set a specific time each day to review and update your Trello board (e.g., 5 PM).
   - **Action:** Start with a 5-10 minute review at 5 PM daily to ensure you're staying on top of your tasks.

2. **Mindfulness Practice:**
   - **Goal:** Try to practice a five-minute breathing exercise at the same time each day.
   - **Action:** Choose a consistent time (e.g., right after making your bed in the morning or during your lunch break) and commit to it.

3. **Accountability Partner:**
   - **Goal:** Plan specific times to meet with Sarah and keep a log of your conversations.
   - **Action:** Schedule a meeting for this week and commit to keeping a log of your discussions.

4. **Workplace Juggling:**
   - **Goal:** Use time management techniques to better juggle your work responsibilities.
   - **Action:** Start using the Pomodoro Technique or time blocking to allocate specific blocks of time for Trello task management and mindfulness.

5. **Self-Compassion:**
   - **Goal:** Acknowledge that setbacks are a natural part of the process.
   - **Action:** Practice self-compassion by reminding yourself that it's okay to have off days and that you're doing your best.

Let's also set a few check-ins for the next few weeks to see how you're doing with these new strategies. This can help us adjust and refine the plan as needed.

Do you have any specific questions or concerns about these strategies, or is there anything else you'd like to add before we conclude this session?

Patient: Thank you for summarizing everything, Nova. I think these actionable steps will help me stay on track. I do have a few questions though:

1. **Trello Task Management System:**
   - How do I handle tasks that come up unexpectedly during my 5 PM review time? Should I reschedule the review or just deal with the new tasks immediately?

2. **Mindfulness Practice:**
   - What if I miss my mindfulness session for a few days? Should I try to make up for it or just start fresh the next day?

3. **Accountability Partner:**
   - How do I ensure that Sarah and I stay committed to our meetings? Should we set specific goals for each meeting or just check in on our progress?

4. **Workplace Juggling:**
   - How do I communicate my needs for time management to my colleagues without seeming unapproachable or unavailable?

I appreciate your help with these questions, Nova. I want to make sure I'm approaching these strategies in the best way possible.

Therapist: : Thank you for your thoughtful questions, Alicia. Let's address each of them one by one to ensure you're fully prepared to implement these strategies effectively:

1. **Trello Task Management System:**
   - **Handling Unexpected Tasks:** It's important to be flexible but consistent. When unexpected tasks arise, you can add them to your Trello board immediately and then review them during your scheduled time. If you find that you're consistently adding a lot of unexpected tasks, you might consider revisiting your prioritization and categorization to ensure your board remains manageable.
   - **Action:** Make it a habit to review your Trello board quickly when new tasks come up, and then log back into the review session at 5 PM. This way, you can integrate the new tasks and ensure you're staying on top of everything.

2. **Mindfulness Practice:**
   - **Missed Sessions:** Itâ€™s natural to miss a session once in a while. The key is not to beat yourself up about it. If you miss a day or two, just acknowledge it and start fresh the next day. Consistency over perfection is what matters most.
   - **Action:** If you miss a session, simply note it in your log and commit to the next one. There's no need to make up for it, as it's more important to get back into the habit as soon as possible.

3. **Accountability Partner:**
   - **Staying Committed:** Setting specific goals for each meeting can help maintain focus and make the conversations more productive. You could also establish some ground rules, such as reviewing progress on specific aspects of your goals or discussing challenges and solutions.
   - **Action:** Plan specific goals for each meeting (e.g., discussing progress on a particular project, addressing imposter syndrome concerns, or setting new personal goals). This structure can help both you and Sarah stay committed and engaged.

4. **Workplace Juggling:**
   - **Communicating Needs:** It's important to communicate your needs professionally and clearly. You might want to draft a brief email or have a brief conversation with your colleagues explaining that you need specific blocks of time for Trello task management and mindfulness practice to maintain productivity and well-being.
   - **Action:** Prepare a short, polite message to your colleagues outlining the importance of these times for you. For example: "Hi [Colleague], I'm working on improving my time management and mental well-being. To help with this, I need to allocate specific times (e.g., 5 PM and [morning time]) to review my Trello board and practice mindfulness. Could you please try to minimize interruptions during these periods? Thank you for your understanding."

Let's also set a few check-ins for the next few weeks to see how you're doing with these new strategies. This can help us adjust and refine the plan as needed.

**Next Steps:**
- **Check-in:** Schedule a follow-up session in.

Patient: Thank you for addressing my questions, Nova. I feel more confident about implementing these strategies now.

For the Trello system, I'll make sure to quickly add any unexpected tasks and then review them during my scheduled 5 PM session. I'll also revisit my prioritization to keep the board manageable.

Regarding mindfulness, I'll just start fresh if I miss a session and not stress about it. Consistency is more important than perfection.

With Sarah, I'll set specific goals for each meeting to keep us both focused and committed. I think having a structured approach will help us stay on track.

As for communicating my needs to my colleagues, I'll draft a polite message explaining the importance of these times for me. I'll make sure to keep it professional and clear.

I appreciate your help, Nova. I'll schedule a follow-up session in two weeks to check in on my progress. I'm ready to give these strategies a try and see how they work for me.

Therapist: : That sounds like a great plan, Alicia. I'm glad to see you're feeling more confident and ready to implement these strategies. Here's a quick recap of our next steps to ensure everything is clear:

1. **Trello Task Management System:**
   - **Quick Review:** Quickly add any unexpected tasks to your Trello board and then review them during your scheduled 5 PM session.
   - **Revisit Prioritization:** Periodically reassess and adjust your task categorization to keep your board manageable.

2. **Mindfulness Practice:**
   - **Start Fresh:** If you miss a session, start fresh the next day. Consistency is key.

   - **Draft Message:** Prepare a polite and professional message to communicate your need for specific blocks of time to your colleagues.

**Next Steps:**
