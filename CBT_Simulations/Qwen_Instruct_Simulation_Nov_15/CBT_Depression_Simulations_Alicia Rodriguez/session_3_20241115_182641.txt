Therapist: : Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again. I'm glad to hear that you've been attending your grief support group and that you're starting to take steps forward in your healing journey. Let's review what you've accomplished since our last session and discuss any new challenges or insights you might have.

From the last session, you mentioned several things that appeared helpful, such as breaking down goals into smaller steps and connecting with others' experiences in the support group. How have these practices been working for you? Are there any new insights or realizations you've had about your journey through grief?

Lastly, let's review the homework you completed and discuss any new techniques or exercises you might want to try. I'm here to support you every step of the way as you continue on your journey towards healing.

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to be back.

Breaking down goals into smaller steps has been really helpful. It makes things feel more manageable, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Connecting with others in the support group has also been a big help. Hearing their stories makes me realize I'm not alone in this, which is comforting.

Talking to my parents about my grief has been tough. I scheduled a call, but I ended up canceling it because I just couldn't find the right words. I know it's important, but it feels so awkward and difficult.

As for salsa dancing, I started taking some online classes. It's been nice to get back into something I enjoy, even if it's just in my living room. It's a small step, but it feels good.

For homework, I attended another grief support group session, which was helpful. I also reached out to a friend for a video call, which was nice but a bit awkward since I haven't talked to them in a while.

I think I need some more guidance on how to approach talking to my parents. Any suggestions?

Therapist: : Hi Alicia, it's good to hear that you're finding the techniques and support helpful. Let's break down what you've shared and explore some strategies for talking to your parents about your grief.

### Progress and Insights
You mentioned that breaking down goals into smaller steps and connecting with others in the support group have been beneficial. This is great to see, as it helps make the process more manageable and less daunting.

### Challenges with Talking to Parents
Talking to your parents about your grief is certainly a challenging but important step. Here are a few strategies that might help:

1. **Preparation:**
   - **Script:** Write down what you want to say. This can help you stay on track and ensure you cover all the points you want to make.
   - **Pain Points:** Identify the specific emotions or experiences that are challenging for you. This can help you articulate what you need or feel.

2. **Timing:**
   - **Choose a Good Time:** Find a moment when your parents are in a good mood and not stressed. Sometimes, a quiet, relaxed evening might be better than a busy day.

3. **Support System:**
   - **Have a Support Person:** If you feel very nervous, consider having a friend or a family member with you for the conversation. They can provide emotional support and even help you navigate the conversation.

4. **Emotional Validation:**
   - **Acknowledge Their Feelings Too:** Let them know it’s okay to share their thoughts and feelings about your grief. This can open up a more honest and supportive dialogue.

### Returning to Activities
It's wonderful that you're taking steps to get back into activities like salsa dancing. Here are a few more ideas to help you stay motivated:

1. **Gradual Re-Entry:**
   - **Start Slow:** Continue with the online classes and gradually build up to more active participation. This can help you adjust to the activity without feeling overwhelmed.

2. **Celebrate Small Wins:**
   - **Acknowledge Progress:** Even small steps forward are achievements. Celebrate them to keep yourself motivated.

### Homework Review
You completed most of the homework assignments, which is great progress. Here’s a quick review:

1. **Grief Support Group:** Attending another session is beneficial. Consider making it a regular part of your routine if it continues to be helpful.
2. **Call with Parents:** It's okay to take it slow and perhaps try again soon. You could start with a shorter, easier conversation to build confidence.
3. **Video Call with Friend:** Reaching out to a friend for a video call is a great way to stay connected and maintain social support.

### Additional Techniques
- **Mindfulness and Grounding Techniques:** You mentioned practicing grounding techniques. These can be especially helpful when you feel anxious or overwhelmed during conversations or activities.
- **Self-Care:**
   - **Daily Rituals:** Incorporate daily self-care activities.

Patient: Thank you for breaking everything down, Nova. It helps to have a clear plan, especially when I'm feeling so overwhelmed.

### Progress and Insights
I've been trying to break down my goals into smaller steps, and it's really helping me stay focused. I started with small tasks at work, like reviewing just one code file a day, instead of the entire project. It makes it feel less impossible. Connecting with others at the grief support group has also been surprisingly comforting. Hearing their experiences makes me feel less alone in this. I never realized how much I needed that validation.

### Challenges with Talking to Parents
I did try to talk to my parents, but it didn't go as well as I hoped. They seemed more focused on how I should be doing better, like grieving shouldn't be taking this much time. It made me feel like I was doing something wrong. I think I need to prepare better, maybe even write out what I want to say like you suggested. It feels overwhelming, but I know it’s important.

### Returning to Activities
I’ve been enjoying the online salsa classes, but I still haven’t gone back to the actual studio yet. I’m worried about feeling out of place or that people will notice how much I’ve missed. I need to start slow like you said, maybe just attend one class and see how it goes.

### Homework Review
The grief

Therapist: : You're welcome, Alicia. It's great to hear that the breakdown of goals and connecting with others in the support group are making a positive impact. Let's continue to build on these strategies and address the challenges you're facing with more tailored approaches.

### Progress and Insights
It's wonderful to hear that breaking down goals into smaller steps is helping you stay focused and feel less overwhelmed. This can be a powerful tool for managing anxiety and making progress. Connecting with others at the grief support group is also incredibly valuable. Sharing your experiences and hearing others' stories can provide a lot of comfort and validation.

### Challenges with Talking to Parents
It's understandable to feel that your parents are more focused on what you "should be doing" rather than your emotional experience. This can be a common challenge when discussing grief. Here are a few additional tips to help you prepare for the conversation:

1. **Script and Support:** Write down what you want to say, and perhaps even practice with a friend or a family member who can give you feedback. Having someone there to support you can also make the conversation easier.
2. **Emotional Preparedness:** Before the conversation, take some time to prepare yourself emotionally. Practice mindfulness or grounding techniques to manage any anxiety.
3. **Focus on Emotional Needs:** It might be helpful to start the conversation by expressing how you feel and what you need. For example, you could say, "I want to talk about how I've been feeling and what kind of support I need right now. I want to make sure I'm okay, and I value your input and support."
4. **Set Boundaries:** If the conversation becomes too overwhelming, it's okay to take a break and revisit the discussion at a later time. Setting boundaries can help you feel in control.

### Returning to Activities
It's great that you're taking small steps in returning to your salsa dancing classes. Here are a few more ideas to help you feel more comfortable:

1. **Start Slow:** Continue attending the online classes and gradually build up to the in-person studio. You could start by attending a single class and see how you feel. Even if you feel out of place, remember that everyone in the class is there to learn and improve.
2. **Celebrate Small Wins:** Acknowledge and celebrate each small step you take. Feeling out of place is a common feeling when you're returning to a hobby after a break. Each time you attend a class or dance, it's a success.
3. **Prepare Mentally:** Before attending the class, take some time to practice mindfulness or grounding techniques. This can help you feel more centered and less anxious.

### Homework Review
You've done well with the homework assignments so far. Here are a few additional suggestions:

1. **Grief Support Group:** Keep attending the support group. It can be a safe space to continue sharing your experiences and hearing from others.
2. **Call with Parents:** If you feel ready.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. Your tips are really helpful. I think I'll try writing a script for talking to my parents. It feels more manageable when I have a plan.

### Progress and Insights
I've been trying to focus on small wins, like finishing a small task at work or attending one online salsa class. It feels good to acknowledge these small steps. The grief support group has been a big help too. I've started to realize that my feelings are valid, even if they don't match what others expect.

### Challenges with Talking to Parents
I'll definitely try writing a script and maybe even practice with a friend. I think having someone there to support me could make a big difference. I'll also focus on expressing my emotional needs and setting boundaries if the conversation gets too overwhelming.

### Returning to Activities
I'll continue with the online salsa classes and plan to attend one in-person class soon. I'll prepare mentally beforehand and celebrate each small step. It's nice to have something to look forward to, even if it's just a small activity.

Do you have any specific exercises or scripts you recommend for talking to my parents? I want to make sure I'm as prepared as possible.

Therapist: : Absolutely, Alicia. Preparing a script and practicing can indeed make the conversation much smoother. Here's a structured script you can use as a starting point:

---

**Script for Talking to Your Parents:**

**Opening:**
- "Hi Mom/Dad, I really appreciate you taking the time to talk today. I've been feeling overwhelmed with everything that has happened recently, and I wanted to share some of my thoughts and feelings with you."

**Expression of Emotions:**
- "I've been going through a lot of emotions, and I want you to know that it's okay to feel the way I do. Grieving a loss is a complex process, and it's not something that can be rushed or controlled."

**Needs and Support:**
- "I would really appreciate some support from you during this time. It would mean a lot to me if you could listen to what I have to say without judgment and offer any support you can. Sometimes, just knowing that you're there for me helps me feel better."

**Boundaries:**
- "I want you to know that it's okay to feel like I'm taking a long time to grieve or that I need space sometimes. I value your understanding and support, and I want to make sure you know that I'm doing the best I can."

**Closing:**
- "Thank you for being such a great parent. I know this might be hard for you too, and I want to assure you that I'm here to talk and work through this together."

---

**Additional Tips:**
- **Practice the Script:** Read the script out loud a few times to get comfortable with it. You can also practice it with a friend who can give you feedback.
- **Mindfulness Before the Call:** Spend a few minutes practicing mindfulness or a grounding technique before you start the conversation to help manage any anxiety.
- **Take Breaks:** If the conversation becomes too overwhelming, it’s okay to take a break and revisit the discussion later. You could say, "I need a moment to process this. Let's continue this conversation in an hour or tomorrow."

### Grounding Technique:
- **5-4-3-2-1 Sensory Exercise:**
  - **5:** Name 5 things you can see around you.
  - **4:** Name 4 things you can touch.
  - **3:** Name 3 things you can hear.
