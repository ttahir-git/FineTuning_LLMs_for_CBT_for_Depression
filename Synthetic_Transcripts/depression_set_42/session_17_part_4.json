  "transcript": "Therapist: Exactly. The 3C's can be a quick and effective way to challenge negative thoughts in the moment. As we continue our work together, we'll keep practicing this technique, along with the other skills we've been working on, like thought records and the Positive Data Log.\n\nBefore we wrap up today's session, I'd like to check in on how you're feeling. How are you doing after our discussion today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better. It's helpful to have these tools to challenge my negative thoughts. I know it's going to take practice, but I feel more hopeful that I can start to change these patterns.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Alejandro. Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks along the way. The important thing is that you keep practicing and being kind to yourself in the process.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue working on the following:\n\n1. Fill out at least one thought record per day, focusing on situations where perfectionism, self-criticism, or the core belief \"I'm not good enough\" show up. Use the 3C's technique to challenge negative thoughts in the moment.\n\n2. Write down at least one piece of evidence each day in your Positive Data Log that supports the belief \"I'm worthy and valuable, even when I'm not perfect.\" Set aside a specific time each day to reflect on your successes and positive experiences.\n\n3. Practice using the self-compassion break mantra \"Thoughts are not facts. I can choose how I respond to them\" when you notice yourself having negative thoughts. Use abbreviated versions or coping statements when it's not possible to do the full technique.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about the homework?\n\nPatient: No, I think I understand. I'll do my best to complete the homework and keep practicing these techniques.\n\nTherapist: Great. If you have any questions or challenges come up during the week, feel free to bring them up in our next session. I'm here to support you.\n\nBefore we end today's session, let's summarize what we've discussed:\n\nSession Summary:\n- Reviewed thought records from the past week and discussed challenges in completing them consistently\n- Explored experiences with the Positive Data Log and strategized ways to make it more manageable, such as setting aside a specific time each day to reflect on successes and positive experiences\n- Continued working on reframing underlying beliefs related to perfectionism, self-criticism, and self-worth using the downward arrow technique and examining evidence for and against the belief \"I'm not good enough\"\n- Introduced the 3C's technique (Catch, Check, Change) for challenging negative thoughts in the moment\n- Checked in on the patient's emotional state and provided support and encouragement\n\nTechniques or exercises used:\n- Thought Records: Reviewed progress and challenges, assigned as ongoing homework\n- Positive Data Log: Discussed experiences and strategized ways to make it more manageable, assigned as ongoing homework\n- Downward Arrow Technique: Used to explore underlying beliefs related to perfectionism, self-criticism, and self-worth\n- 3C's Technique: Introduced and practiced using the 3C's to challenge negative thoughts in the moment\n\nHomework assigned:\n- Fill out at least one thought record per day, focusing on situations where perfectionism, self-criticism, or the core belief \"I'm not good enough\" show up, and use the 3C's technique to challenge negative thoughts\n- Write down at least one piece of evidence each day in the Positive Data Log that supports the belief \"I'm worthy and valuable, even when I'm not perfect,\" and set aside a specific time each day to reflect on successes and positive experiences\n- Practice using the self-compassion break mantra \"Thoughts are not facts.
