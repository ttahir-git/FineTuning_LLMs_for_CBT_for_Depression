  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I don't have anything else to add.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your thought records from the past week. Were you able to complete them as planned, focusing on situations where perfectionism, self-criticism, or the core belief \"I'm not good enough\" showed up?\n\nPatient: I did fill out some thought records, but I didn't manage to do one every day. I found it challenging to take the time to sit down and write out my thoughts, especially when I was feeling overwhelmed or down on myself.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that it can be difficult to consistently complete thought records, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. Remember, the goal is not to be perfect, but to practice the skill of recognizing and challenging negative thoughts. Let's look at one of the thought records you did complete. Can you share an example?\n\nPatient: Sure. There was one day last week when I made a mistake at work, and I started thinking, \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right.\" I felt really down and discouraged. In the thought record, I tried to look at the evidence for and against that thought.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. What evidence did you come up with for and against the thought \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right\"?\n\nPatient: Well, the evidence for the thought was the mistake I made at work. But when I thought about evidence against the thought, I realized that I've had a lot of successes at work too. I've received positive feedback from my boss and coworkers, and I've completed many projects successfully.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent point, Alejandro. It's easy to focus on the negative and overlook the positive, especially when we have perfectionistic tendencies. Recognizing the full picture, including your successes and positive feedback, can help challenge the idea that you're a failure.\n\nNow, let's explore your experiences with the Positive Data Log. Were you able to write down at least one piece of evidence each day that supports the belief \"I am capable and competent at work\"?\n\nPatient: I tried to do the Positive Data Log, but I found it even more challenging than the thought records. I kept forgetting to write things down, and when I did remember, I sometimes struggled to come up with evidence.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Alejandro. It can be difficult to shift our focus from the negative to the positive, especially when we're used to being self-critical. One strategy that can help is to set aside a specific time each day to reflect on your successes and positive experiences, no matter how small they may seem.\n\nFor example, you could take five minutes at the end of each workday to think about what went well and write it down in your Positive Data Log. This could be something as simple as completing a task, receiving a positive email from a colleague, or even just showing up and doing your best on a difficult day.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I think setting aside a specific time each day could help me be more consistent with the Positive Data Log.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And remember, the goal is not to have a log full of major accomplishments, but rather to recognize the small, everyday successes that demonstrate your capability and competence.\n\nNow, let's shift our focus to reframing underlying beliefs related to perfectionism, self-criticism, and self-worth. Last session, we identified the core belief \"I'm not good enough\" and the intermediate belief \"If I don't do things perfectly, I'm a failure.\" I'd like to explore these beliefs further and work on developing more balanced and adaptive beliefs.\n\nOne technique we can use is the downward arrow technique. This involves asking yourself, \"If that belief were true, what would that mean about me?\" and continuing to dig deeper until you reach the core belief. Let's try this together. If the belief \"If I don't do things perfectly, I'm a failure\" were true, what would that mean about you?",
