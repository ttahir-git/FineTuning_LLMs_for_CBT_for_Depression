  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I'm particularly interested in discussing the challenges I faced with setting boundaries at work and managing the guilt that comes with it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point to focus on, Alejandro. Let's start by reviewing your experience with the Positive Data Log and the evidence you've gathered related to setting boundaries and prioritizing your well-being. Can you share some of the entries you made in your log this week?\n\nPatient: Sure. On Monday, I left work on time, which was difficult because I felt like I should stay late to finish up some tasks. However, I reminded myself that spending time with my children is important, and I wrote in my log that \"Setting boundaries allows me to prioritize my family and well-being.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, I practiced saying \"no\" to a colleague who asked me to take on an additional project. I felt guilty at first, but I realized that I was already at capacity with my current workload. In my log, I wrote, \"It's okay to say no when I'm already stretched thin. Setting boundaries helps me maintain a manageable workload.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent examples of using the Positive Data Log to gather evidence that challenges your previous beliefs about setting boundaries. Recognizing that setting boundaries allows you to prioritize your family and well-being, and that it's okay to say no when you're already at capacity, are significant insights. How did recording these experiences in your log impact your thoughts and emotions?\n\nPatient: Writing down these experiences helped me see that setting boundaries isn't a sign of weakness or selfishness. It actually helps me maintain a better balance between work and personal life. I still struggle with feelings of guilt, but having this evidence in my log makes it easier to challenge those thoughts when they arise.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Alejandro. Using the Positive Data Log to gather evidence that supports new, more adaptive beliefs is a powerful way to challenge the negative thoughts that contribute to feelings of guilt. It's normal to still experience some guilt as you work on setting boundaries, but having this evidence can help you reframe those thoughts and reinforce your new beliefs.\n\nNow, let's discuss some of the challenges you faced with setting boundaries at work this week. Can you share a specific situation where you found it difficult to set a boundary, and what thoughts and emotions came up for you in that moment?\n\nPatient: One situation that stands out is when my boss asked me to stay late on Thursday to help with a last-minute project. I had already made plans to have dinner with my children, but I felt like I couldn't say no because I didn't want to disappoint my boss or seem like I wasn't a team player.\n\nTherapist: That's a challenging situation, and it's understandable that you felt conflicted. Let's break down the thoughts and emotions that came up for you in that moment. What was going through your mind when your boss asked you to stay late?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"If I don't stay late, my boss will think I'm not committed to my job,\" and \"I should be able to handle this extra work without complaining.\" I felt anxious and guilty, like I was letting my boss down by prioritizing my personal plans.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts and emotions are consistent with the intermediate beliefs we've identified, such as \"If I don't stay late, my boss will think I'm not a team player,\" and \"I should be able to handle this workload without complaining.\" These beliefs contribute to feelings of guilt and anxiety when you try to set boundaries.\n\nLet's use the downward arrow technique to explore the deeper core beliefs that might be underlying these thoughts. If it were true that your boss would think you're not committed to your job if you didn't stay late, what would that mean to you?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not valuable or competent as an employee, and that my job might be at risk.\n\nTherapist: And if that were true, that you're not valuable or competent, and your job might be at risk, what would that mean about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not good enough, and that I'm failing in my responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: This is a great example of how our surface-level thoughts and intermediate beliefs can be connected to deeper core beliefs, such as \"I'm not good enough.\" These core beliefs can drive our emotions and behaviors, making it difficult to set boundaries and prioritize our well-being.\n\nNow that we've identified this core belief, let's work on reframing it using the evidence you've gathered in your Positive Data Log. Can you think of any experiences from this week that challenge the idea that you're not good enough?\n\nPatient: Well, I did receive positive feedback from a client on a project I completed last week. They were really happy with my work and said I went above and beyond. That felt good and made me think that maybe I am competent and valuable, even if I don't always stay late.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent piece of evidence to challenge the core belief that you're not good enough. Recognizing positive feedback and acknowledging your own accomplishments can help you build a more balanced and accurate view of yourself.\n\nLet's continue to explore this core belief and gather more evidence to support a new, more adaptive belief, such as \"I am competent and valuable, and setting boundaries does not diminish my worth.\"",
