  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's great to see you again for session 8. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been since our last session? How has your mood been, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the mindfulness breaks at work, and it's been helpful to some extent. I'm still struggling with setting boundaries, though. I find myself taking on more than I can handle, and the guilt creeps in when I try to say no. My mood has been up and down \u2013 I have moments where I feel a bit lighter, but then I get caught up in negative thoughts again.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the mindfulness breaks have been somewhat helpful, Alejandro. It's common to face challenges when learning to set boundaries, especially when guilt is involved. We can definitely explore that further today. I also hear that your mood has been fluctuating, which is understandable given the circumstances. \n\nBefore we dive in, let's set an agenda for our session. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be beneficial to discuss your experiences with setting boundaries and the guilt that arises. We can also review your thought records and see if there are any patterns or specific thoughts we can work on reframing. What are your thoughts on that? Is there anything else you'd like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I agree that setting boundaries and dealing with guilt are important topics for me. I'm also curious about exploring the underlying beliefs that might be contributing to these struggles. And maybe we can touch on some strategies for managing the fluctuations in my mood?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Alejandro. We can definitely explore the underlying beliefs that may be fueling your guilt and difficulty with setting boundaries. That's a great insight. We can also discuss some strategies for managing mood fluctuations, such as distress tolerance techniques and behavioral activation. Here's a proposed agenda for our session:\n\n1. Explore experiences with setting boundaries and associated guilt\n2. Identify underlying beliefs related to guilt and boundary-setting\n3. Review thought records and practice reframing\n4. Discuss strategies for managing mood fluctuations\n5. Assign homework and plan for the next session\n\nHow does that sound? Is there anything you'd like to add or modify?\n\nPatient: That agenda covers everything I had in mind, Nova. I think it's a solid plan for our session today. I'm ready to dive in.",
