  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by exploring your experiences with setting boundaries at work and the guilt that arises. Can you share a specific situation where you struggled to set a boundary and how it made you feel?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just last week, my boss asked me to stay late to finish up a project, even though I had already made plans with my kids. I wanted to say no, but I felt guilty about letting the team down. I ended up canceling my plans and staying late, but I felt resentful and frustrated with myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Alejandro. I can understand why you felt guilty and torn between your work responsibilities and your desire to spend time with your children. Let's break this down a bit. What was going through your mind when your boss asked you to stay late?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"If I don't stay late, my boss will think I'm not a team player,\" and \"I should be able to handle this workload without complaining.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are important to recognize. They point to some underlying beliefs that may be contributing to your guilt and difficulty setting boundaries. Let's use a technique called the \"downward arrow\" to explore this further. If your boss thought you weren't a team player, what would that mean to you?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not doing my job well enough, and that I'm letting everyone down.\n\nTherapist: And if that were true, what would that say about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not good enough, and that I'm failing in my responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your openness in sharing that, Alejandro. It seems like there might be a core belief at play here, something along the lines of \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I have to be perfect to be valued.\" Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think you're right. I've always felt like I need to be perfect to be worthy of respect and appreciation, both at work and in my personal life.\n\nTherapist: That's a common belief, and it can be a heavy burden to carry. The good news is that we can work on reframing that belief and developing a more balanced perspective. Let's start by examining the evidence for and against the thought \"I should be able to handle this workload without complaining.\"\n\nWhat evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've always been able to handle my workload in the past, and I don't want to let my team down. I feel like I should be able to manage it all without needing to set boundaries.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have that goes against this thought?\n\nPatient: I know that everyone has limits, and it's not realistic to expect myself to be able to do everything without ever needing a break or having to say no. And when I do take on too much, my mental health suffers, and I'm not as present for my kids.\n\nTherapist: That's an important insight, Alejandro. Recognizing that everyone has limits and that taking on too much can have negative consequences is a key step in reframing this belief. Let's see if we can come up with a more balanced thought, one that acknowledges your strengths and responsibilities, but also allows for self-care and boundary-setting.\n\nHow about something like, \"I am capable and committed to my work, but I also have a right to set healthy boundaries and prioritize my well-being and family time.\" How does that feel to you?",
