  "transcript": "Patient: That feels more balanced, Nova. It's going to take some practice to really believe it, but I like the idea of acknowledging my strengths and responsibilities while also setting healthy boundaries.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Alejandro. Reframing core beliefs is a process, and it takes time and practice to internalize new ways of thinking. We can continue to work on this together, and I'll provide you with tools and strategies to support you along the way.\n\nSpeaking of tools, I'd like to introduce a technique called the \"Positive Data Log.\" This is a way to actively collect evidence that supports your new, more balanced belief. The idea is to write down any experiences, situations, or interactions that provide evidence for your new belief, no matter how small they may seem.\n\nFor example, if you successfully set a boundary at work and still feel valued by your team, you could write that down as evidence that you can prioritize your well-being and still be a good employee. Does this make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think so. It's like keeping a log of moments that support this new way of thinking, right?\n\nTherapist: Exactly! You're catching on quickly, Alejandro. By actively looking for and recording evidence that supports your new belief, you're helping to strengthen it in your mind. This can be especially helpful when you're feeling doubtful or when old thought patterns start to creep in.\n\nWould you be willing to try keeping a Positive Data Log as part of your homework for this week? You could aim to write down at least one piece of evidence per day that supports your new belief about setting boundaries and prioritizing your well-being.\n\nPatient: I'm willing to give it a try. It might be challenging at first to recognize those moments, but I think it could be really helpful in the long run.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Alejandro. It's normal for it to feel challenging at first, but with practice, it will become easier to recognize and record those moments. And remember, no piece of evidence is too small \u2013 every bit counts!\n\nAnother technique we can use to support your new belief is called \"behavioral experiments.\" This involves setting up small, manageable experiments to test out your new belief and gather more evidence to support it.\n\nFor example, you could set an experiment where you practice setting a boundary at work, such as leaving on time one day instead of staying late. Then, you could observe the outcomes and record any evidence that supports your new belief, such as still being valued by your team or feeling more balanced in your life.\n\nWhat do you think about trying a behavioral experiment this week, in addition to keeping your Positive Data Log?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of setting up experiments to test out this new way of thinking. It makes it feel more concrete and actionable. I'm a bit nervous about actually setting the boundary, but I know it's important to practice.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel nervous about setting boundaries, especially when it's something new. That's why we'll start with small, manageable experiments and gradually work our way up. We can also discuss strategies for setting boundaries assertively and dealing with any pushback you might encounter.\n\nHow about we set up your first behavioral experiment together right now? Let's choose a small boundary you could set at work this week, and then we can discuss how you might go about setting it and what evidence you could look for to support your new belief.\n\nPatient: Okay, let's do it. I think a good first experiment could be leaving work on time one day this week, instead of staying late like I usually do. That feels manageable but still challenging.\n\nTherapist: That's a great choice for your first experiment, Alejandro. Leaving work on time is a clear, specific boundary, and it's something you can plan for and practice. Let's discuss how you might go about setting this boundary and what evidence you could look for to support your new belief.",
