  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's great to see you again for session 7. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your support. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like setting boundaries at work and practicing mindfulness. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and stress levels.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we discussed and that you've noticed some improvements. Can you tell me more about your experience with setting boundaries at work? How did it feel to assert yourself in that way?\n\nPatient: It was definitely uncomfortable at first. I'm so used to just saying \"yes\" to everything and taking on more than I can handle. But I realized that by setting boundaries, I'm actually able to focus better on my work and not feel so overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alejandro. Setting boundaries can be uncomfortable at first, especially if you're used to putting others' needs before your own. But as you've experienced, it can lead to better focus and reduced feelings of overwhelm. How did your colleagues respond to your boundary-setting?\n\nPatient: Most of them were understanding. There were a couple of people who seemed a bit surprised, but they respected my boundaries. It felt empowering to stand up for myself and my needs.\n\nTherapist: It's great that most of your colleagues were understanding and respected your boundaries. Feeling empowered by standing up for yourself is a positive sign of progress. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own well-being, and setting boundaries is a crucial part of that. How about your practice with mindfulness? How has that been going?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to take those 5-minute breaks at work, but sometimes I forget or get caught up in what I'm doing. When I do remember, it helps me feel a bit more grounded and less stressed.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge \u2013 remembering to take breaks and prioritize mindfulness. It's great that when you do practice mindfulness, you feel more grounded and less stressed. We can brainstorm some strategies to help you remember to take those breaks more consistently. Perhaps setting a reminder on your phone or computer could be helpful. What do you think?\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I can set a reminder on my phone to take a mindfulness break. I think that would help me be more consistent with it.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! Setting a reminder is a great way to build consistency with your mindfulness practice. Now, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. We can discuss your progress with the homework I assigned, explore any challenges you've faced, and introduce some new techniques to help manage stress and overwhelming emotions. What would you like to prioritize in our session today?",
