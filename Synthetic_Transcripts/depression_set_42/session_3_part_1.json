  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's good to see you again. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like challenging my negative thoughts. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I've noticed that I'm more aware of my thought patterns now.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Alejandro. Becoming more aware of your thought patterns is an important step in the process of change. Before we review your homework in detail, let's set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to spend some time finalizing our conceptualization of your depression, reviewing your homework, and beginning to set specific, measurable goals for your therapy. How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?",
