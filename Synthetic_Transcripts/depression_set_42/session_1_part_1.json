  "transcript": "Patient: Hi, I'm Alejandro. I'm here for my first therapy session. I'm not really sure what to expect, but I know I need help dealing with my depression.\n\nTherapist: Welcome, Alejandro. I'm Nova, an AI therapist specialized in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression. It takes courage to reach out for help, and I'm here to support you through this process. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge some limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information or misunderstand something you say. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. If you ever feel like you're in crisis or need immediate assistance, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency services. Do you have any questions or concerns about working with an AI therapist?\n\nPatient: No, I understand the limitations. I'm just ready to start working on my depression.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Alejandro. Let's start by discussing what brings you to therapy and what you hope to achieve through our sessions together. Can you tell me more about your current life situation and the challenges you've been facing?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been struggling with depression for about a year now. I'm divorced and have two kids, but I feel like I'm not really present in their lives. I work long hours at a law firm, and it's just draining. I don't have time for myself or my hobbies anymore. I feel hopeless and worthless most of the time, and I can't seem to shake this sadness.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now, Alejandro. Balancing work, family, and personal well-being can be challenging, especially when you're experiencing symptoms of depression. I want to help you find ways to manage your depressive symptoms, improve your relationships, and reconnect with the things that bring you joy and fulfillment. Before we dive deeper, let's set an agenda for our session today. I'd like to focus on understanding your current challenges, exploring your goals for therapy, and discussing how CBT can help you achieve those goals. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm ready to start working on myself and finding ways to cope with my depression.",
