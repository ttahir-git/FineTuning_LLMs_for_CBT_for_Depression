  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for CBT session 19 of 20 with Alejandro:\n\nPatient: Using the coping cards and meta-thought records was challenging at first, but I'm starting to see how they can help me catch those negative thoughts and reframe them. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alejandro. Building the habit of using these tools takes practice, and it's normal to struggle with remembering to use them in the heat of the moment. One strategy that can help is to schedule regular check-ins with yourself throughout the day, where you take a few minutes to reflect on your thoughts and emotions and complete a meta-thought record if needed. You can even set reminders on your phone to prompt you. How do you think that might work for you?\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I like the thought of having a regular check-in with myself. I can see how that would help me catch those negative thoughts before they spiral out of control.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And as you continue to practice, it will become more automatic to notice those thoughts and challenge them in the moment. Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate negative thoughts completely, but to build the skills to manage them in a healthier way.\n\nPatient: I'm realizing that a lot of my negative thoughts are tied to my perfectionism. I put so much pressure on myself to be the perfect employee, the perfect father, the perfect son. It's exhausting.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Alejandro. Perfectionism can be a major driver of negative thoughts and feelings of inadequacy. In our work together, we've started to explore some of the intermediate and core beliefs that underlie your perfectionism, like the belief that \"If I don't do things perfectly, I'm a failure.\" As we continue to challenge those beliefs and build new, more adaptive ones, it can help reduce the pressure you put on yourself. What do you think would be a more balanced belief to work towards?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced belief would be something like, \"I'm human, and it's okay to make mistakes sometimes. My worth isn't defined by my performance.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative belief, Alejandro. It acknowledges your humanity and inherent worth, regardless of your performance. As we continue our work together, we can practice reinforcing that belief and catching ourselves when we fall into perfectionistic thinking patterns. Speaking of continuing our work, I want to acknowledge that we're nearing the end of our planned sessions together. While you've made tremendous progress, I want to make sure we have a solid plan in place for you to continue supporting yourself after our sessions end. What thoughts do you have about that?\n\nPatient: It's bittersweet to think about our sessions ending. I feel like I've made a lot of progress, but I also worry about maintaining it on my own. I think having a plan in place will help me feel more confident.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you brought up that mix of feelings, Alejandro. It's normal to feel both a sense of accomplishment and some apprehension about ending therapy. That's why creating a relapse prevention plan is so important. We can work together to identify the tools and strategies that have been most helpful for you, and make a plan for how you can continue to use them independently. We can also discuss how you can access support from others, like your sister or a support group, if needed. What are some of the tools and strategies that you think will be most important for you to continue using?",
