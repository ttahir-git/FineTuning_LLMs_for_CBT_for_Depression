  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's dive deeper into the connection between your perfectionism, self-criticism, and core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" Can you think of a recent situation where you noticed these beliefs showing up?\n\nPatient: Yes, just last week at work. I was working on a big project with a tight deadline, and I found myself getting really stressed and frustrated with myself. I kept thinking, \"I should be able to handle this better\" and \"If I don't do this perfectly, I'm a failure.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Alejandro. Let's break it down using the CBT triangle, which illustrates how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected and influence each other.\n\nIn this situation, what emotions did you notice? And how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt really anxious and overwhelmed, probably around an 80. I also felt frustrated with myself, maybe a 70.\n\nTherapist: And what thoughts were going through your mind in that moment?\n\nPatient: I kept thinking, \"I should be able to handle this better. I'm not good enough. If I don't do this perfectly, I'm a failure. Everyone will think I'm incompetent.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are some really powerful thoughts, and I can see how they would contribute to feelings of anxiety and frustration. What about behaviors? How did you respond or react in that situation?\n\nPatient: I ended up staying late at work, trying to perfect every detail of the project. I skipped lunch and didn't take any breaks. I was really irritable with my coworkers, too. I snapped at one of them when they asked me a question.\n\nTherapist: It's clear how your thoughts of \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I should be able to handle this better\" led to feelings of anxiety and frustration, which then influenced your behaviors, like staying late, skipping meals, and being irritable with coworkers.\n\nLet's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm not good enough.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I was struggling with the project and feeling overwhelmed. I couldn't seem to get everything perfect, no matter how hard I tried. And I snapped at my coworker, which makes me feel like I'm not a good teammate.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have that goes against the thought \"I'm not good enough\"?\n\nPatient: Hmm, well, I have been successful in my job for several years now. I've received positive feedback from my boss and coworkers in the past. And even though I was struggling with this project, I was still making progress and putting in a lot of effort.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought \"I'm not good enough.\" It shows that you have a history of success and that you're capable of handling challenges, even if it's difficult in the moment.\n\nNow, let's generate an alternative thought that takes into account all the evidence. What's a more balanced and compassionate way to view this situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"I'm struggling with this project, but that doesn't mean I'm not good enough. I have a history of success, and I'm putting in my best effort. It's okay to ask for help or take breaks when I need them.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought, Alejandro! It acknowledges the challenge you're facing while also recognizing your strengths and the importance of self-care.\n\nHow do you think this alternative thought would impact your feelings and behaviors in that situation?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel less anxious and frustrated. Maybe more like a 40 or 50 instead of an 80. And I would probably be more likely to take breaks, ask for help, and be kinder to my coworkers.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. By reframing your thoughts in a more balanced and compassionate way, you can directly impact your emotions and behaviors in a positive way.\n\nAs we continue to practice this skill, you'll start to notice these patterns more easily in the moment. And with practice, it will become more automatic to challenge those negative thoughts and replace them with more adaptive ones.\n\nWhat do you think about this process of using the CBT triangle and looking at the evidence for and against your thoughts?\n\nPatient: It's really eye-opening to see how my thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all connected. I can see how challenging my negative thoughts could make a big difference in how I feel and act, especially at work.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that this process resonates with you, Alejandro. As we continue to practice these skills together, you'll likely find it easier and more automatic to challenge those negative thoughts and replace them with more balanced and compassionate ones.\n\nRemember, this is a skill that takes time and practice to develop, so be patient and kind with yourself as you're learning. Celebrate the small victories along the way, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.\n\nWhat questions or thoughts do you have about using the CBT triangle and challenging your negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: I don't have any specific questions right now, but I'm sure I will as I start to practice these skills more. I'm just really grateful to have these tools and to be working on this with you.\n\nTherapist: I'm grateful to be working on this with you, too, Alejandro. Remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or insights as you practice these skills, please don't hesitate to bring them up in our sessions.\n\nSpeaking of practicing these skills, let's talk about some homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue filling out thought records, focusing on situations where you notice perfectionism, self-criticism, or the core belief of \"I'm not good enough\" showing up.",
