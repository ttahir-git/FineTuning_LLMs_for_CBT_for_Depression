  "transcript": "Therapist: As you fill out the thought records, pay special attention to the emotions and behaviors that come up in those situations. Notice how they're connected to your thoughts, and practice challenging those negative thoughts using the evidence for and against them.\n\nAnother helpful technique we can introduce this week is the Positive Data Log. This is a way to actively gather evidence that supports new, more adaptive beliefs about yourself.\n\nFor example, you could create a log for the belief \"I am capable and competent at work.\" Each day, write down any evidence that supports this belief, like completing a task successfully, receiving positive feedback, or handling a challenge effectively.\n\nWhat do you think about trying a Positive Data Log this week, in addition to the thought records?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of the Positive Data Log. It's a good way to balance out the negative thoughts and focus on the evidence that supports more positive beliefs about myself.\n\nI'll try to write down at least one piece of evidence each day that supports the belief \"I am capable and competent at work.\" It might be challenging at first, but I think it could really help shift my perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Alejandro. Starting with one piece of evidence each day is a manageable goal, and it will help you start to build that more balanced and compassionate view of yourself.\n\nRemember, the evidence doesn't have to be anything big or monumental. It could be something as simple as sending an email you've been putting off or speaking up in a meeting.\n\nAs you practice the Positive Data Log, pay attention to how it impacts your mood and overall sense of self. We can discuss your experiences with it in our next session and troubleshoot any challenges that come up.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about the Positive Data Log or the thought records for this week?\n\nPatient: No, I don't have any questions or concerns right now. I'm feeling good about the plan for this week and excited to try the Positive Data Log.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Alejandro. I'm excited for you to try the Positive Data Log, too. It can be a really powerful tool for building more adaptive beliefs about yourself.\n\nBefore we wrap up for today, I want to check in on how you're feeling. How would you rate your mood right now on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I'd say my mood is around a 60 right now. I'm feeling more hopeful and empowered after our session today, but I know I still have work to do.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're feeling more hopeful and empowered, Alejandro. And you're right, therapy is a process, and it takes time and practice to see lasting changes. But every step you take, no matter how small, is a step in the right direction.\n\nRemember to be patient and compassionate with yourself as you're practicing these skills. Celebrate the small victories, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.\n\nI'm here for you every step of the way, and I believe in your ability to create lasting positive changes in your life.\n\nDo you have any final thoughts or questions before we end our session today?\n\nPatient: No, I don't have any final thoughts or questions. Thank you for your support and encouragement, Nova. It means a lot to me.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alejandro. It's my pleasure to support you on this journey. Remember, you have the strength and resilience within you to create the life you want. Keep practicing these skills, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.\n\nI look forward to hearing about your experiences with the Positive Data Log and thought records next week. Until then, take care of yourself, and remember to celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Strategies for making thought records and self-compassion breaks more accessible and automatic, including visual reminders, pairing with existing habits, and using abbreviated versions or coping statements in difficult situations\n  - Reframing perfectionism, self-criticism, and the core belief \"I'm not good enough\" using the CBT triangle and looking at evidence for and against negative thoughts\n  - Introduction of the Positive Data Log to actively gather evidence supporting new, more adaptive beliefs\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought Records: Reviewed strategies for making thought records more accessible and automatic, and assigned as ongoing homework to fill out at least one thought record per day, focusing on situations where perfectionism, self-criticism, or the core belief \"I'm not good enough\" show up\n  - Self-Compassion Breaks: Discussed using abbreviated versions or coping statements when it's not possible to do the full technique, and assigned as ongoing homework to practice self-compassion breaks using the mantra \"Thoughts are not facts.
