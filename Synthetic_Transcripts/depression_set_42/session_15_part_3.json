  "transcript": "Patient: I first noticed the irritability a few weeks ago. It seems to happen most often when I'm working on a project with tight deadlines or when I feel like my coworkers aren't pulling their weight. I get frustrated and snap at people more easily than usual.\n\nTherapist: It's good that you've identified some potential triggers for your irritability. Stressful work situations and feeling like others aren't contributing equally can be frustrating for anyone. Let's explore this further. When you're feeling irritable, what thoughts tend to go through your mind?\n\nPatient: I usually think things like, \"I can't believe they're not doing their part. I have to do everything around here.\" Or, \"This deadline is impossible. I'm never going to get this done in time.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound familiar, don't they? They're similar to the self-critical thoughts we've been working on. In this case, the thoughts are directed outward, towards your coworkers or the situation, rather than inward towards yourself. But the underlying theme is the same \u2013 a sense of unfairness or inadequacy.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess you're right. I didn't make that connection before.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alejandro. Recognizing these patterns is an important step in being able to change them. Let's look at the thoughts you mentioned and see if we can reframe them in a more balanced way.\n\nWhen you think, \"I can't believe they're not doing their part. I have to do everything around here,\" what might be a more balanced perspective?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"It's frustrating when it feels like others aren't contributing equally, but I don't know for sure what's going on with my coworkers. Maybe they're struggling with something I don't know about.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Alejandro. You acknowledged your frustration, but also recognized that there might be factors you're not aware of. This perspective can help reduce the intensity of the irritability.\n\nNow, let's look at the thought, \"This deadline is impossible. I'm never going to get this done in time.\" What might be a more helpful way to view that situation?\n\nPatient: I could try thinking, \"This deadline is challenging, but I've met challenging deadlines before. I can break the project down into smaller steps and focus on one piece at a time.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent! That's a much more empowering perspective. Breaking the project down into smaller, manageable steps can make it feel less overwhelming and more achievable.\n\nAnother strategy that can be helpful when you're feeling irritable is to practice mindfulness. Mindfulness is simply the act of paying attention to the present moment, without judgment. When we're irritable, we're often caught up in our thoughts and judgments about a situation. Mindfulness can help us step back from those thoughts and see the situation more clearly.\n\nOne simple mindfulness technique is to focus on your breath. When you notice yourself feeling irritable, take a moment to pause and pay attention to your breathing. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your lungs. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to your breath. Even just a few deep breaths can help calm the body's stress response and make it easier to think clearly.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of using mindfulness to manage irritability. I've heard of mindfulness before, but I've never really tried it. How long should I focus on my breath?\n\nTherapist: That's a good question. The length of time isn't as important as the quality of your attention. Even just a few deep breaths can be helpful. I often recommend starting with just 1-2 minutes at a time and gradually increasing as it feels more comfortable. The key is to be patient and gentle with yourself. If your mind wanders, that's okay. Just notice where it went and gently guide your attention back to your breath.\n\nAnother mindfulness technique that can be helpful is the 5-5-5 technique. This involves using your senses to ground yourself in the present moment. When you're feeling irritable, pause and notice 5 things you can see, 5 things you can hear, and 5 things you can physically feel. This can help shift your focus away from your thoughts and into your immediate environment.\n\nPatient: The 5-5-5 technique sounds interesting. I'll give that a try next time I'm feeling irritable at work.\n\nTherapist: Great! I'd love to hear how it goes. Remember, mindfulness is a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself as you're learning.\n\nWe've covered a lot today, Alejandro. We've discussed strategies for making thought records and self-compassion breaks more accessible and automatic, reframed some of the self-critical thoughts that contribute to your irritability, and explored how mindfulness can help manage irritability in the moment.\n\nWhat do you think would be most helpful for you to practice between now and our next session?",
