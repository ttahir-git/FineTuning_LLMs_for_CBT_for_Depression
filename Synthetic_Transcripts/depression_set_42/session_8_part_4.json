  "transcript": "Therapist: To set this boundary, you could start by clearly communicating your intention to your boss or team. You could say something like, \"I wanted to let you know that I'll be leaving on time today to attend to some personal commitments. I'll make sure to wrap up my tasks for the day and will be available if anything urgent comes up.\"\n\nPatient: That sounds reasonable. I guess I could also make sure I'm extra productive during the day, so I feel less guilty about leaving on time.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Alejandro. Being proactive and ensuring you're on top of your tasks can help you feel more confident in setting the boundary. And remember, leaving on time occasionally is a reasonable request, and it doesn't mean you're not a dedicated employee.\n\nAs for evidence to support your new belief, you could look for things like your boss's or coworkers' reactions to you leaving on time. If they're understanding or if there are no negative consequences, that's evidence that you can set boundaries and still be valued. You could also pay attention to how you feel after leaving on time \u2013 if you notice any improvements in your mood or energy levels, that's evidence that setting boundaries is beneficial for your well-being.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can do that. I'll try to pay attention to how people react and how I feel afterward. It'll be good to have some concrete evidence to support this new way of thinking.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Gathering that evidence will be crucial in helping you internalize this new belief. And remember, even if there are some challenges or pushback, that doesn't necessarily mean setting boundaries is wrong or impossible. It may just mean you need to have a further conversation or find a compromise.\n\nBefore we wrap up, let's discuss your homework for this week. In addition to keeping your Positive Data Log, I'd like you to try setting the boundary of leaving work on time at least once this week. Pay attention to the evidence you gather through this experiment, and we can discuss it at our next session.\n\nI'd also like you to continue practicing mindfulness breaks at work and using thought records to reframe any negative thoughts, especially those related to guilt and perfectionism. And let's not forget about engaging in meaningful activities with your children \u2013 that's an important part of maintaining a balanced life.\n\nPatient: That all sounds good, Nova. I'll do my best to complete the homework and pay attention to the evidence I gather. I'm feeling a bit more hopeful about being able to set boundaries and prioritize my well-being.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that, Alejandro. It's wonderful that you're feeling more hopeful. Remember, change takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself. You're making great progress, and I'm confident that you'll continue to grow and develop healthier thought patterns and behaviors.\n\nHow are you feeling now, as we wrap up our session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling encouraged and motivated, but also a bit nervous about putting these new strategies into practice. It's going to be a challenge, but I know it's important for my mental health and overall well-being.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions as you embark on this journey of change. Remember that you have the skills and support to navigate these challenges, and every small step counts. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nBefore we end our session, let's summarize what we've discussed today:\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Setting boundaries at work and dealing with associated guilt\n  - Identifying and reframing underlying beliefs related to perfectionism and self-worth\n  - Introduction of the Positive Data Log and behavioral experiments\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Downward arrow technique to identify underlying beliefs\n  - Cognitive restructuring to develop more balanced thoughts\n  - Positive Data Log to gather evidence supporting new beliefs\n  - Behavioral experiments to test out new beliefs and gather evidence\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Keep a Positive Data Log, recording at least one piece of evidence per day that supports new beliefs about setting boundaries and prioritizing well-being\n  - Set the boundary of leaving work on time at least once this week, and pay attention to the evidence gathered through this experiment\n  - Continue practicing mindfulness breaks at work and using thought records to reframe negative thoughts related to guilt and perfectionism\n  - Engage in meaningful activities with children\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - Alejandro is making progress in recognizing and reframing negative thought patterns, but still struggles with setting boundaries and managing guilt\n  - Depression symptoms: Fluctuating mood, feelings of guilt and inadequacy, difficulty setting boundaries\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Core belief: \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I have to be perfect to be valued\"\n  - Intermediate belief: \"If I don't stay late, my boss will think I'm not a team player,\" and \"I should be able to handle this workload without complaining\"\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue working on setting boundaries and managing guilt\n  - Explore the connection between setting boundaries and self-worth\n  - Monitor progress with Positive Data Log and behavioral experiments\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Check in on progress with homework and discuss any challenges or insights that arose during the week\n  - Review evidence gathered through Positive Data Log and behavioral experiments\n  - Continue exploring and reframing underlying beliefs related to perfectionism and self-worth\n  - Introduce additional strategies for managing mood fluctuations and setting boundaries as needed\n\nThank you for your hard work today, Alejandro.
