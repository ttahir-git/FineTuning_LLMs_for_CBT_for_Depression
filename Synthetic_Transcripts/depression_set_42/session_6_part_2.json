  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by discussing your experience with implementing mindfulness breaks at work. Can you tell me how that's been going for you?\n\nPatient: It's been a bit of a challenge, to be honest. I've been trying to take those 5-minute breaks we talked about, but sometimes I get caught up in my work and forget. When I do remember, I find it helpful to step away from my desk and focus on my breathing. It helps me feel a bit more centered and less stressed.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been making an effort to take those mindfulness breaks, even if it's been challenging at times. Remembering to take breaks can be difficult, especially when you're busy at work. What do you think might help you remember to take those breaks more consistently?\n\nPatient: I think setting a reminder on my phone or computer could be helpful. That way, I'll have a visual cue to take a break, even if I'm in the middle of something.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Alejandro. Using a reminder can be a helpful way to build a new habit. Let's talk a bit more about your experience with the mindfulness breaks themselves. When you do take those breaks, how do you feel during and after the practice?\n\nPatient: During the breaks, I feel a sense of calm and relaxation. It's like I'm giving myself permission to step away from the stress and just focus on the present moment. After the break, I feel a bit more refreshed and ready to tackle the rest of my work.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful that you're noticing those positive effects from your mindfulness practice. That sense of calm and refreshment can be so helpful in managing stress and improving your overall well-being. As you continue to practice, you may find that it becomes easier to access that sense of calm, even in the midst of a stressful day.\n\nPatient: I hope so. I know I need to be more consistent with the practice, but I'm encouraged by the benefits I've experienced so far.\n\nTherapist: Your commitment to the practice, even in the face of challenges, is admirable. Remember, building a new habit takes time and patience. Be kind to yourself as you continue to work on incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine.\n\nLet's shift gears a bit and talk about your experience with setting boundaries at work. How has that been going for you?",
