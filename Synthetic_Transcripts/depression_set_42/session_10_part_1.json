  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's great to see you again for session 10. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to start by acknowledging my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week, but I've been trying to apply what we've discussed in therapy. I've been using the Positive Data Log and practicing the self-compassionate statement when I feel guilty about setting boundaries at work. It's not easy, but I'm making an effort.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on applying the techniques we've discussed, even though it's been challenging. Can you tell me more about your experience with using the Positive Data Log and self-compassionate statement? How have they been helpful, and what difficulties have you encountered?\n\nPatient: The Positive Data Log has been helpful in making me more aware of the times when I do set boundaries and prioritize my well-being. It's easy for me to focus on the negative and forget about the progress I've made. The self-compassionate statement has been a bit more difficult for me to use consistently. I find myself feeling guilty even when I know I shouldn't.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're recognizing the benefits of the Positive Data Log in helping you acknowledge your progress. Regarding the self-compassionate statement, it's common to experience resistance or difficulty in applying it consistently. We can explore this further today and see if we can find ways to make it more accessible for you. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I definitely want to work on being more consistent with the self-compassionate statement.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's add that to our agenda for today. What else would you like to focus on in our session?\n\nPatient: I've been struggling with mood fluctuations lately. One moment I feel okay, and the next, I'm feeling down and hopeless. It's been hard to manage these ups and downs.\n\nTherapist: Mood fluctuations can be challenging to navigate. Let's make sure to discuss strategies for managing them today. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: I think that covers the main things I wanted to discuss.\n\nTherapist: So, our agenda for today includes:\n1. Reviewing your experience with the Positive Data Log and self-compassionate statement\n2. Exploring ways to make the self-compassionate statement more accessible and consistent\n3. Discussing strategies for managing mood fluctuations\nDoes this sound accurate, or is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.",
