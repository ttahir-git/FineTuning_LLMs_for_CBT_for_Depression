  "transcript": "Patient: Setting boundaries at work has been a real challenge for me. I feel like I'm always saying yes to everything, even when I know I shouldn't. I don't want to disappoint anyone or let them down.\n\nTherapist: It's common to struggle with setting boundaries, especially when you're concerned about disappointing others. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a situation where you found it difficult to set a boundary at work?\n\nPatient: Just last week, my boss asked me to stay late to finish up a project, even though I had already made plans with my kids. I didn't want to let him down, so I agreed to stay, but I felt guilty about canceling on my kids.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Alejandro. Let's break this down a bit. What thoughts were going through your mind when your boss asked you to stay late?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"If I don't stay, my boss will think I'm not dedicated to my job,\" and \"I need to be a team player, even if it means sacrificing my personal life.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts reveal some of the underlying beliefs that may be contributing to your difficulty with setting boundaries. It seems like you equate saying no with being undedicated or not a team player. Let's challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that saying no in that situation would make you undedicated or not a team player?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess there have been times when I've said no to staying late, and my boss didn't seem to hold it against me. And I know that other people on my team have set boundaries without being seen as undedicated.\n\nTherapist: That's an important insight, Alejandro. It shows that setting boundaries doesn't necessarily mean you're not dedicated or a team player. In fact, setting healthy boundaries can actually help you be more effective at work by preventing burnout and resentment.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I need to work on changing my mindset around setting boundaries.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. As we've discussed before, our thoughts influence our feelings and behaviors. By challenging and reframing those thoughts, we can start to change our feelings and behaviors as well.\n\nLet's practice reframing one of those thoughts. Instead of thinking, \"If I don't stay, my boss will think I'm not dedicated to my job,\" how could you reframe that thought in a more balanced way?\n\nPatient: I could think, \"Saying no to staying late doesn't mean I'm not dedicated. I can show my dedication in other ways, like producing high-quality work during my regular hours.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Alejandro! It acknowledges the importance of dedication while also recognizing that there are many ways to demonstrate it beyond just staying late. As you continue to practice reframing those thoughts, it will become easier to set boundaries without feeling guilty or worried about others' perceptions.\n\nAnother helpful strategy for setting boundaries is to use clear, assertive communication. This means expressing your needs and limits in a direct, respectful way. Let's role-play a situation where you set a boundary with your boss using assertive communication. I'll play the role of your boss, and you can practice responding.",
