  "transcript": "Patient: When I completed the project on time, I kept thinking that I could have finished it earlier or done a better job. I felt like I didn't put in enough effort, even though I was working late and sacrificing time with Lian. It's like no matter how much I do, it's never enough.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mei. It seems like your thoughts were focused on what you could have done better, rather than acknowledging your hard work and the fact that you completed the project on time. This type of thinking is called \"disqualifying the positive,\" where you dismiss your accomplishments and focus only on the perceived shortcomings. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about the evidence that supports the thought \"I could have finished it earlier or done a better job\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I compare myself to my colleagues who seem to be able to handle multiple projects at once and still have time for their personal lives. I feel like if I were truly good at my job, I would be able to do that too.\n\nTherapist: It's common to compare ourselves to others, but it's important to remember that everyone has different circumstances and ways of working. Comparing yourself to your colleagues without knowing their full situation can lead to feelings of inadequacy. Let's look at the evidence that challenges the thought \"I could have finished it earlier or done a better job.\" What are some facts that contradict this thought?\n\nPatient: I suppose the fact that I did complete the project on time, despite the challenges, is evidence that I did a good job. My manager also complimented my work during the project review meeting.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence to challenge the negative thought! Completing the project on time and receiving positive feedback from your manager are clear indicators that you did a good job. Now, let's try to reframe the original thought in a more balanced way. How could you state it differently, taking into account the evidence we just discussed?\n\nPatient: I could say, \"I completed the project on time and to a satisfactory standard, even though it was challenging. There's always room for improvement, but I should acknowledge my hard work and the positive feedback I received.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic way of looking at the situation, Mei. By acknowledging your hard work and the positive outcome, you're giving yourself credit for your accomplishments, while still recognizing that there's room for growth. How does this reframed thought make you feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel a bit better about the situation. I still feel like I could have done more, but I can see that I'm being too hard on myself.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're able to recognize that you're being hard on yourself. Challenging these negative thoughts and reframing them in a more balanced way can help reduce feelings of worthlessness and guilt over time. Remember, it's a process, and it takes practice to change long-standing thought patterns. Let's continue to work on this throughout our sessions.\n\nNow, let's shift our focus to the situation with Lian. You mentioned feeling guilty for not spending time with her during the period when you were working on the project. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that contributed to this guilt?",
