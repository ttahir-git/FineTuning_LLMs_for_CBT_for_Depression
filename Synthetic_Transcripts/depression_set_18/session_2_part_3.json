  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you explaining those concepts, Nova. The thought records make sense to me in theory, but I worry that I'll have trouble coming up with evidence against my negative thoughts in the moment. And as for behavioral activation, I like the idea of setting small goals related to my interests, but I'm not sure I'll have the energy or motivation to follow through.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid concerns, Mei, and they're very common among people starting CBT. Challenging negative thoughts and engaging in activities can feel daunting at first, especially when depression is zapping your energy and motivation. That's why we'll take a gradual approach and break things down into manageable steps.\n\nWith thought records, it's okay if you have trouble coming up with counter-evidence at first. The act of writing down your thoughts and examining them more objectively is a valuable skill in itself. As we practice this together, it will get easier to identify distortions and generate alternative perspectives.\n\nAs for behavioral activation, we'll start with very small, achievable goals and build up from there. For example, you could set a goal to take a 10-minute walk outside or spend 5 minutes looking at photography inspiration online. The key is to choose activities that feel doable and to focus on the process rather than the outcome.\n\nAnother important aspect of CBT is homework assignments between sessions. These assignments help you practice skills, gather data about your experiences, and maintain progress. Homework might include things like continuing your mood journal, completing thought records, or scheduling pleasant activities. We'll collaborate to choose assignments that feel relevant and manageable for you.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on setting some initial therapy goals related to what we've discussed? We could start by identifying a few areas you'd like to work on, such as challenging negative thoughts about work, increasing engagement in hobbies, or improving communication with your partner.\n\nPatient: Setting goals makes sense to me. I definitely want to work on challenging those negative thoughts about work, as that's a big source of stress for me. I like the idea of starting small with hobbies, maybe setting a goal to take my camera out once a week. And I know I need to work on opening up more to Lian, but that feels scary.\n\nTherapist: Those are great initial goals, Mei. We can start there and refine them as we go. It's very normal to feel scared about opening up to loved ones, especially if you're used to keeping things to yourself. We can explore that further and come up with some strategies for improving communication in a way that feels safe and manageable for you.\n\nI want to acknowledge the courage it takes to start this therapy process and share your struggles with me. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. The key is to keep showing up for yourself and reaching out for support when you need it.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue tracking your moods and thoughts in your journal, and try to identify any cognitive distortions that come up. We can review that together in our next session. I'd also like you to choose one small activity related to photography or hiking to engage in, even if it's just for a few minutes. We can discuss how that goes as well.\n\nHow do you feel about those homework assignments? Do you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: The homework assignments seem doable. I'll keep up with the mood journal and try to get out with my camera once this week, even if it's just in my neighborhood. I'm a little nervous about identifying distortions on my own, but I'll give it a try.\n\nI don't have any major questions right now, but I'm sure I will as we go along. I appreciate you breaking things down and giving me concrete tools to work with. It makes the process feel a little less overwhelming.",
