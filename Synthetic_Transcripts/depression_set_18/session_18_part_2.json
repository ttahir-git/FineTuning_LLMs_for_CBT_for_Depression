  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your Positive Data Log. Can you share some of the entries you've made since our last session?\n\nPatient: Sure. One entry I made was about a project I completed at work. My manager praised my attention to detail and problem-solving skills. Another entry was about a conversation I had with Lian, where I expressed my feelings using \"I\" statements, and we were able to have a productive discussion about our relationship.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples, Mei. What did you learn from these experiences?\n\nPatient: I learned that I am capable of doing good work, even if it's not perfect. And I saw how using \"I\" statements helped me communicate more effectively with Lian, which brought us closer together.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful to see how you're applying the skills we've discussed in therapy to your life. Recognizing your own strengths and accomplishments is an important part of building self-esteem and challenging perfectionistic thoughts. Let's also take a moment to review the thought records you've been keeping. Can you share an example of a thought record you completed recently?\n\nPatient: Yes, I had a situation at work where I made a small mistake on a project. My initial thought was, \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right.\" But then I challenged that thought by looking at the evidence. I reminded myself that everyone makes mistakes sometimes and that one mistake doesn't define my entire work performance. I also considered what I would say to a friend in a similar situation, and I realized I would be much more compassionate with them than I was being with myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how you can use thought records to challenge negative thoughts and develop a more balanced perspective. It's also important to practice self-compassion, as you mentioned. We often hold ourselves to higher standards than we would others. As we approach the end of our sessions together, I want to start focusing on how you can maintain the progress you've made and continue using these skills independently. One way to do this is by creating a personalized \"toolbox\" of CBT skills and strategies that you can refer to when faced with challenges. What are some of the tools you think should be in your toolbox?\n\nPatient: I think thought records, \"I\" statements, and the Positive Data Log should definitely be in there. I've also found the 5-5-5 mindfulness technique helpful for managing my mood when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: Those are all great tools to include. Another important aspect of maintaining your progress is having a plan in place for managing potential setbacks. Let's discuss some strategies for coping with challenges that may arise after our sessions have ended. One strategy is to create a \"wellness action plan\" that outlines steps you can take if you start to notice your symptoms worsening. What are some signs that might indicate you need to put your wellness action plan into action?\n\nPatient: I think if I start to feel more irritable or withdrawn, or if I notice myself falling back into old patterns of perfectionistic thinking, those could be signs that I need to take action.\n\nTherapist: Those are good examples. Your wellness action plan might include steps like reviewing your thought records, reaching out to Lian or other supportive people in your life, or engaging in self-care activities like exercise or meditation. It's also important to remember that setbacks are a normal part of the recovery process and don't mean that you've failed or that your progress isn't real. What are some other strategies you can use to cope with setbacks?",
