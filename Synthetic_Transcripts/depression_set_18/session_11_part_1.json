  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI before we begin. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice self-compassion and challenge my guilty thoughts around self-care. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood. I still struggle with feelings of worthlessness and guilt, especially when it comes to work and taking care of others.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on practicing self-compassion and challenging your guilty thoughts. It's a great step forward, and it's normal to face challenges along the way. I appreciate your honesty about still struggling with feelings of worthlessness and guilt. Let's make sure to address those feelings in today's session. Before we set our agenda, could you share a bit more about how your mood has been and any specific situations that have triggered those feelings of worthlessness and guilt?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. I've had some good days where I feel a bit more energized and motivated, but I also have days where I feel really low and struggle to get out of bed. In terms of specific situations, I recently had a project at work that required me to stay late and put in extra hours. Even though I completed the project on time, I couldn't shake the feeling that I should have done more or worked even harder. I also felt guilty for not being able to spend time with Lian during that period.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mei. It's common for moods to fluctuate, and it's okay to have both good and bad days. Regarding the situation at work, it seems like your core belief of \"I'm only a good person if I'm always working hard and putting others' needs before my own\" was triggered. Despite completing the project on time, you felt like you should have done more, which led to feelings of worthlessness and guilt. Additionally, feeling guilty for not spending time with Lian during that period could be related to your belief that you should always prioritize others' needs. Let's add exploring these situations and related beliefs to our agenda for today. What else would you like to prioritize in our session?\n\nPatient: I think it would be helpful to discuss strategies for managing my mood fluctuations and finding a better balance between work and personal life. I also want to continue working on challenging my negative thoughts and core beliefs.\n\nTherapist: Those are great points to add to our agenda, Mei. To summarize, our agenda for today includes:\n\n1. Exploring the situations that triggered feelings of worthlessness and guilt related to work and personal life\n2. Discussing strategies for managing mood fluctuations\n3. Finding a better balance between work and personal life\n4. Continuing to challenge negative thoughts and core beliefs\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I think that covers the main points I'd like to focus on today.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by exploring the situation at work that triggered your feelings of worthlessness and guilt. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that went through your mind when you completed the project on time but still felt like you should have done more?",
