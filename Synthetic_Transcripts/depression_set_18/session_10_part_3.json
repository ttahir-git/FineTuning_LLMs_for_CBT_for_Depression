  "transcript": "Patient: Yes, that definitely resonates with me. I feel like I have all these \"should\" statements in my head, and they make it really hard to prioritize self-care without feeling guilty.\n\nTherapist: You're not alone in that struggle. Many people have those kinds of \"should statements\" that can fuel feelings of guilt and make it challenging to engage in self-care. Let's explore this further using a technique called the \"downward arrow.\" I'll ask you a series of questions to help us uncover some of the underlying beliefs that might be driving these \"should statements.\" Are you willing to give it a try?\n\nPatient: Sure, that sounds interesting. What kind of questions will you ask?\n\nTherapist: I'll start by asking you to identify a specific \"should statement\" that comes up for you around work and self-care. Then, I'll ask you a series of questions to help us dig deeper and uncover the underlying beliefs. For example, I might ask, \"If that were true, what would that mean to you?\" or \"What's the worst part about that for you?\" We'll keep going until we reach a core belief that feels really central to your experience. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think so. One \"should statement\" that comes up a lot for me is \"I should always be available to my team, even outside of work hours.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's start with that one. What would it mean to you if you weren't always available to your team outside of work hours?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not pulling my weight or being a good team player. Like I'm letting them down.\n\nTherapist: And what's the worst part about letting your team down?\n\nPatient: The worst part is that they might think I'm lazy or selfish. Like I don't care about the project or the company.\n\nTherapist: And if your team thought you were lazy or selfish, what would that mean about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not a good employee... or even a good person. Like I'm not living up to my family's values of hard work and self-sacrifice.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for being so open and vulnerable in sharing that. It sounds like there might be a core belief there around your worth as a person being tied to your productivity and self-sacrifice. We could state that core belief as something like, \"I'm only a good person if I'm always working hard and putting others' needs before my own.\" How does that feel to you?\n\nPatient: It feels really heavy and kind of scary to say out loud, but I think you're right. That belief feels really central to how I see myself and how I approach work and self-care.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight. Now that we've identified this core belief, we can start to examine it more closely and work on reframing it in a more balanced and compassionate way. One way to do that is to look for evidence that contradicts the belief. For example, can you think of a time when you prioritized your own needs and it didn't lead to a negative outcome for your team or your work?\n\nPatient: Well, there was one time a few months ago when I had to leave work early for a doctor's appointment. I felt really guilty about it, but my team was totally understanding and they managed just fine without me for the rest of the day.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of evidence that contradicts the core belief. It shows that prioritizing your own needs doesn't necessarily lead to negative outcomes for your team or your work. As we continue to gather more evidence like this, we can start to build a more balanced and compassionate belief, like \"I can be a good employee and a good person while also taking care of my own needs.\" What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: It feels a little uncomfortable, honestly. Like it goes against everything I've been taught. But I can see how it could be really freeing to believe that.\n\nTherapist: It's totally normal for new beliefs to feel uncomfortable at first, especially when they challenge long-held beliefs that are tied to our family and cultural values. The key is to keep practicing and gathering evidence to support the new belief. One way to do that is to keep a \"positive data log,\" where you write down examples of times when you prioritized self-care and it didn't lead to negative outcomes. Would you be willing to try that as homework between now and our next session?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that could be really helpful. I'll try to write down at least one example every day.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal. Remember, the more evidence we can gather to support the new belief, the easier it will become to challenge those old \"should statements\" and make self-care a more regular part of your routine.",
