  "transcript": "Therapist: Welcome back, Mei! It's great to see you for our 20th session together. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say, as I can't directly observe non-verbal cues. If you ever find yourself in crisis or need emergency services, please reach out to a local provider who can offer immediate assistance. With that said, how have you been since our last session? How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing relatively well. I've been practicing the thought records and trying to engage in more self-care activities, like going for hikes on the weekends. It hasn't been easy, but I do feel like I'm making progress. Today, I'm feeling a bit anxious about this being our last scheduled session, but I'm also proud of how far I've come.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that you've been applying the skills we've discussed and noticing improvements, Mei. Acknowledging progress while also recognizing the challenges that remain is an important part of the journey. It's understandable to feel some anxiety about this being our last scheduled session. Let's make sure to address that during our time today. What else would you like to prioritize for our agenda?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to discuss strategies for maintaining my progress after our sessions end. I'm worried about slipping back into old patterns without the regular check-ins. I'd also like to talk more about managing my feelings of guilt and worthlessness related to work and self-care. Even though I've made progress, those thoughts still creep in sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today, Mei. We can definitely discuss strategies for maintaining your progress and managing any setbacks that may arise. We can also explore those lingering feelings of guilt and worthlessness, and how to continue challenging them. How about we start with discussing your experiences with self-care and hobbies since our last session, and then move into relapse prevention planning and addressing those negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me, Nova. I've been trying to prioritize self-care more, like you suggested. I went on a hike last weekend, and it felt really good to be out in nature. But I still find myself feeling guilty afterwards, like I should have been working instead.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you were able to enjoy a hike and connect with nature, Mei. It's a great step towards prioritizing self-care. Let's explore that guilt you experienced afterwards. Can you walk me through the thoughts that came up for you after the hike?",
