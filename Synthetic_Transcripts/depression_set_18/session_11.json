I look forward to seeing you at our next session.\n\nTherapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI before we begin. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice self-compassion and challenge my guilty thoughts around self-care. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood. I still struggle with feelings of worthlessness and guilt, especially when it comes to work and taking care of others.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on practicing self-compassion and challenging your guilty thoughts. It's a great step forward, and it's normal to face challenges along the way. I appreciate your honesty about still struggling with feelings of worthlessness and guilt. Let's make sure to address those feelings in today's session. Before we set our agenda, could you share a bit more about how your mood has been and any specific situations that have triggered those feelings of worthlessness and guilt?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. I've had some good days where I feel a bit more energized and motivated, but I also have days where I feel really low and struggle to get out of bed. In terms of specific situations, I recently had a project at work that required me to stay late and put in extra hours. Even though I completed the project on time, I couldn't shake the feeling that I should have done more or worked even harder. I also felt guilty for not being able to spend time with Lian during that period.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mei. It's common for moods to fluctuate, and it's okay to have both good and bad days. Regarding the situation at work, it seems like your core belief of \"I'm only a good person if I'm always working hard and putting others' needs before my own\" was triggered. Despite completing the project on time, you felt like you should have done more, which led to feelings of worthlessness and guilt. Additionally, feeling guilty for not spending time with Lian during that period could be related to your belief that you should always prioritize others' needs. Let's add exploring these situations and related beliefs to our agenda for today. What else would you like to prioritize in our session?\n\nPatient: I think it would be helpful to discuss strategies for managing my mood fluctuations and finding a better balance between work and personal life. I also want to continue working on challenging my negative thoughts and core beliefs.\n\nTherapist: Those are great points to add to our agenda, Mei. To summarize, our agenda for today includes:\n\n1. Exploring the situations that triggered feelings of worthlessness and guilt related to work and personal life\n2. Discussing strategies for managing mood fluctuations\n3. Finding a better balance between work and personal life\n4. Continuing to challenge negative thoughts and core beliefs\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I think that covers the main points I'd like to focus on today.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by exploring the situation at work that triggered your feelings of worthlessness and guilt. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that went through your mind when you completed the project on time but still felt like you should have done more?\n\nPatient: When I completed the project on time, I kept thinking that I could have finished it earlier or done a better job. I felt like I didn't put in enough effort, even though I was working late and sacrificing time with Lian. It's like no matter how much I do, it's never enough.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mei. It seems like your thoughts were focused on what you could have done better, rather than acknowledging your hard work and the fact that you completed the project on time. This type of thinking is called \"disqualifying the positive,\" where you dismiss your accomplishments and focus only on the perceived shortcomings. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about the evidence that supports the thought \"I could have finished it earlier or done a better job\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I compare myself to my colleagues who seem to be able to handle multiple projects at once and still have time for their personal lives. I feel like if I were truly good at my job, I would be able to do that too.\n\nTherapist: It's common to compare ourselves to others, but it's important to remember that everyone has different circumstances and ways of working. Comparing yourself to your colleagues without knowing their full situation can lead to feelings of inadequacy. Let's look at the evidence that challenges the thought \"I could have finished it earlier or done a better job.\" What are some facts that contradict this thought?\n\nPatient: I suppose the fact that I did complete the project on time, despite the challenges, is evidence that I did a good job. My manager also complimented my work during the project review meeting.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence to challenge the negative thought! Completing the project on time and receiving positive feedback from your manager are clear indicators that you did a good job. Now, let's try to reframe the original thought in a more balanced way. How could you state it differently, taking into account the evidence we just discussed?\n\nPatient: I could say, \"I completed the project on time and to a satisfactory standard, even though it was challenging. There's always room for improvement, but I should acknowledge my hard work and the positive feedback I received.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic way of looking at the situation, Mei. By acknowledging your hard work and the positive outcome, you're giving yourself credit for your accomplishments, while still recognizing that there's room for growth. How does this reframed thought make you feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel a bit better about the situation. I still feel like I could have done more, but I can see that I'm being too hard on myself.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're able to recognize that you're being hard on yourself. Challenging these negative thoughts and reframing them in a more balanced way can help reduce feelings of worthlessness and guilt over time. Remember, it's a process, and it takes practice to change long-standing thought patterns. Let's continue to work on this throughout our sessions.\n\nNow, let's shift our focus to the situation with Lian. You mentioned feeling guilty for not spending time with her during the period when you were working on the project. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that contributed to this guilt?\n\nPatient: When I was working on the project and couldn't spend time with Lian, I kept thinking that I was being a bad partner. I felt like I was neglecting her and not giving her the attention she deserves.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that you felt guilty about not being able to spend time with Lian while you were focused on your work project. Let's explore this thought further. What do you think it means to be a \"bad partner\"?\n\nPatient: I guess I think that a bad partner is someone who doesn't make time for their significant other, someone who prioritizes other things over their relationship.\n\nTherapist: That's a helpful definition. Now, let's consider the evidence for and against the thought that you're a bad partner. What evidence supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, the fact that I was working late and not spending time with Lian during that period seems like evidence that I'm a bad partner.\n\nTherapist: Okay, that's one piece of evidence. Now, let's look at the evidence against this thought. What are some things that contradict the idea that you're a bad partner?\n\nPatient: I suppose the fact that I feel guilty about not spending time with Lian shows that I care about her and our relationship. Also, when I'm not working on a big project, I do make an effort to spend quality time with her and support her.\n\nTherapist: Those are important pieces of evidence to consider. Feeling guilty about not spending time with Lian actually demonstrates that you value your relationship and want to be a good partner. And the fact that you make an effort to spend quality time with her when you're not overwhelmed with work contradicts the thought that you're a bad partner.\n\nLet's try to reframe this thought in a more balanced way. How could you state it differently, taking into account the evidence we just discussed?\n\nPatient: I could say, \"Even though I had to prioritize work during the project, it doesn't mean I'm a bad partner. I feel guilty because I care about Lian and our relationship, and I make an effort to be there for her when I can.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic way of looking at the situation, Mei. Recognizing that having to prioritize work at times doesn't define your entire relationship is an important insight. It's also great that you acknowledge your feelings of guilt as evidence of your care for Lian, rather than as proof that you're a bad partner.\n\nAs we continue to work on challenging these negative thoughts and core beliefs, it's essential to practice self-compassion. Remember that being a good partner doesn't mean being perfect or always putting the other person's needs first. It's about making an effort to balance your own needs with the needs of your relationship.\n\nLet's explore some strategies for managing your mood fluctuations and finding a better balance between work and personal life. One technique that can be helpful is called \"behavioral activation.\" This involves scheduling activities that you enjoy or find meaningful, even when you don't feel motivated to do them. The idea is that engaging in these activities can help improve your mood and give you a sense of accomplishment.\n\nCan you think of some activities that you enjoy or find meaningful that you could schedule into your week?\n\nPatient: I used to enjoy photography and hiking, but I haven't done much of either lately. I suppose I could try to schedule some time on the weekends to go for a hike or work on a photography project.\n\nTherapist: Scheduling time for photography and hiking sounds like a great idea, Mei. Engaging in activities that you enjoy can help improve your mood and give you a sense of accomplishment. When you do these activities, try to be present in the moment and observe how they make you feel. This can help you challenge the belief that taking time for yourself is selfish or unproductive.\n\nAnother strategy for managing mood fluctuations is to practice mindfulness. Mindfulness involves paying attention to the present moment without judgment. It can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings and create a sense of distance from them. One simple mindfulness exercise is called the \"5-5-5 technique.\" When you notice yourself feeling low or anxious, take a moment to identify five things you can see, five things you can hear, and five things you can physically feel in your surroundings. This can help ground you in the present moment and reduce the intensity of your emotions.\n\nPatient: I've heard of mindfulness before, but I've never really tried it. The 5-5-5 technique sounds like something I could do even when I'm at work and starting to feel overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Mei. The 5-5-5 technique is a simple way to practice mindfulness, and it can be done anywhere. As you continue to practice, you may find that it becomes easier to observe your thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them.\n\nAnother important aspect of managing mood fluctuations is self-care. We've talked about the importance of challenging the belief that taking care of yourself is selfish. Engaging in regular self-care activities, such as exercise, relaxation, and spending time with loved ones, can help improve your overall mood and resilience.\n\nPatient: I know that self-care is important, but it's still hard for me to prioritize it sometimes. I feel like I should be using that time to work or take care of others.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that you feel that way, Mei. Challenging long-standing beliefs takes time and practice. Remember that taking care of yourself is not selfish; it's necessary for your overall well-being and ability to support others. As we continue to work on reframing your core beliefs, it may become easier to prioritize self-care without feeling guilty.\n\nBefore we wrap up today's session, let's discuss some homework assignments. I'd like you to continue practicing the 5-5-5 technique whenever you notice yourself feeling low or anxious. Try to schedule at least one self-care activity this week, such as going for a hike or working on a photography project. Continue to use the thought record to challenge negative thoughts and practice reframing them in a more balanced way. Finally, try to have a conversation with Lian about your feelings of guilt and your desire to find a better balance between work and your relationship. What do you think about these homework assignments?\n\nPatient: I think these assignments are manageable. I'll try to practice the 5-5-5 technique and schedule some self-care activities. I'm a bit nervous about talking to Lian, but I know it's important for our relationship.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're willing to try these homework assignments, Mei. Talking to Lian may be challenging, but it can also be an opportunity to strengthen your connection and understanding of each other. Remember to approach the conversation with an open mind and a willingness to listen to her perspective as well.\n\nAs we end today's session, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling. What are your main takeaways from our discussion today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful about managing my mood fluctuations and finding a better balance in my life. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to try the techniques we discussed. My main takeaway is that I need to challenge my negative thoughts and beliefs and prioritize self-care, even when it feels difficult.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Challenging negative thoughts related to work performance and being a good partner\n  - Strategies for managing mood fluctuations, including behavioral activation, mindfulness, and self-care\n  - Importance of self-compassion and reframing core beliefs\n  - Planning a conversation with Lian about balancing work and relationship needs\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records to challenge negative thoughts and reframe them in a more balanced way\n  - Behavioral activation: Scheduling enjoyable activities to improve mood\n  - 5-5-5 mindfulness technique to manage mood fluctuations\n  - Discussing the importance of self-care and challenging beliefs that prioritize others' needs over one's own\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  1.
