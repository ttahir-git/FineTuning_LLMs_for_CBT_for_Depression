  "transcript": "Patient: You're right, I should focus on specific self-care practices I can commit to. One thing I've been wanting to do more of is photography. It used to be a passion of mine, but I haven't made much time for it lately.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Mei. Photography can be a wonderful form of self-expression and a way to engage with the world around you. What do you think has been getting in the way of you pursuing this passion?\n\nPatient: I think part of it is that I've been so focused on work and trying to be perfect in every aspect of my life. I felt like I didn't have time for hobbies or things that weren't directly related to my goals.\n\nTherapist: That's a common trap that many people fall into \u2013 prioritizing work and external expectations over our own needs and passions. But as we've discussed before, self-care isn't selfish. It's essential for our overall well-being and actually helps us be more effective in other areas of our lives.\n\nPatient: I know you're right, but it's still hard to break that mindset sometimes. I feel guilty if I'm not constantly working or being productive.\n\nTherapist: That guilt is something we can explore further. It's likely tied to some of those intermediate beliefs we've identified, like the idea that taking breaks or engaging in self-care means you're not working hard enough. Let's do a thought record on this together. What's a specific situation where you felt guilty for taking time for yourself?\n\nPatient: Well, just last weekend, I had planned to spend a few hours on Saturday morning doing photography in the park. But when Saturday came around, I ended up spending most of the day catching up on work emails instead. I told myself that the photography could wait, but deep down, I felt guilty for even considering taking that time for myself.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's break this down. What was the automatic thought that came up when you considered going out to do photography?\n\nPatient: I think the thought was something like, \"I shouldn't be wasting time on hobbies when I have so much work to do.\"\n\nTherapist: And what emotions did that thought bring up for you?\n\nPatient: I felt guilty, anxious, and maybe a bit ashamed.\n\nTherapist: And what did you do in response to those emotions?\n\nPatient: I ended up staying home and working all day, even though I didn't really need to.\n\nTherapist: So we can see how that automatic thought influenced your emotions and your behavior. Now let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence supports the idea that doing photography would have been a waste of time?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose there's the fact that I did have work emails to catch up on. And I often feel like I'm already behind on work, so taking time away from that can feel stressful.\n\nTherapist: Okay, those are valid points. Now what about evidence against the thought? What are some reasons why doing photography might not have been a waste of time?\n\nPatient: Well, photography is something I enjoy, and it helps me relax and express myself creatively. And like you said, taking breaks and engaging in self-care can actually make me more productive in the long run. Plus, I had specifically planned that time for photography, so it's not like I was neglecting my work responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: Those are all great points, Mei. So when we look at the evidence for and against the thought, what's a more balanced perspective?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced perspective would be that taking a few hours for photography isn't necessarily a waste of time. It's an important part of self-care and can actually benefit me in the long run, even if it means taking a break from work.\n\nTherapist: That's a much more helpful way of looking at it. And how do you feel when you consider that perspective?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit lighter, I think. Less guilty and more empowered to make time for the things I enjoy.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Mei. This is a great example of how doing a thought record can help shift our perspective and make us feel more balanced. As you continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to catch those automatic thoughts and challenge them in the moment.\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be helpful. I'll try to keep practicing, even when it feels difficult.\n\nTherapist: That's all you can do, Mei \u2013 keep practicing, and trust that it will get easier over time. Remember, you don't have to be perfect at this. The goal is progress, not perfection.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. That's a good reminder. I'll try to be patient with myself and celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude to have, Mei. And speaking of celebrating victories, let's take a moment to acknowledge the progress you've made in this area. A few months ago, would you have been able to challenge that thought about wasting time on hobbies?\n\nPatient: Probably not. I think I would have just accepted it as true and felt even more guilty and ashamed.\n\nTherapist: See how far you've come? That's something to be really proud of. And as you continue to practice these skills, you'll likely find that it becomes easier and more automatic to challenge those types of thoughts.\n\nPatient: I hope so. It's encouraging to see that progress is possible, even if it's slow sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And remember, slow progress is still progress. Every small step counts, and every time you challenge a negative thought or make a healthier choice for yourself, you're building that mental muscle and making it easier for next time.\n\nPatient: That's a good way of looking at it. I'll try to keep that in mind when I'm feeling discouraged.\n\nTherapist: You know, Mei, I'm sitting here thinking about how much you've grown over the course of our sessions together. I remember when we first started working together, you were really struggling with feelings of worthlessness and guilt, and you had a hard time even identifying your own emotions and needs.\n\nPatient: It's true. I was in a pretty dark place back then. I didn't really believe that things could get better, or that I had the power to change anything.\n\nTherapist: And look at you now \u2013 you're able to recognize your own thoughts and emotions, challenge the ones that aren't serving you, and make active choices to prioritize your own well-being. That's a huge shift, Mei, and it's something to be really proud of.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a lot of hard work, but it's also been so worth it. I feel like I have a whole new set of tools and skills now, and I'm excited to keep using them and seeing where they take me.\n\nTherapist: I'm excited for you too, Mei. And I have no doubt that you'll continue to make progress and grow, even after our sessions together have ended. You've got this.\n\nPatient: Thank you for all your support and guidance, Nova. I couldn't have done it without you.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mei. But remember, you're the one who did the work. You showed up for yourself, week after week, even when it was hard. You challenged yourself to think differently and try new things. That took a lot of courage and strength, and that's all you.\n\nPatient: I appreciate you saying that. It means a lot to hear that from you.\n\nTherapist: I mean every word of it, Mei. You've come so far, and I have full confidence in your ability to continue this work independently. And remember, just because our sessions are ending doesn't mean you're alone in this. You have your toolbox, your support system, and the option to reach out if you need to.",
