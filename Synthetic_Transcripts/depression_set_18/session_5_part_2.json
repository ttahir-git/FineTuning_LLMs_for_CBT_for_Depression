  "transcript": "Patient: I've been struggling with feelings of guilt and regret when it comes to my mother's passing. I keep thinking about all the things I should have done differently, like spending more time with her or being more supportive.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience feelings of guilt and regret when grieving the loss of a loved one. These thoughts, however, can sometimes be cognitive distortions that intensify our emotional pain. One such distortion is \"should statements,\" which involve rigid expectations we place on ourselves or others. Can you identify any \"should statements\" in your thoughts about your mother?\n\nPatient: I guess saying that I \"should have spent more time with her\" or that I \"should have been more supportive\" are examples of those kinds of statements.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. These statements can make us feel like we've failed in some way, even when we've done our best given the circumstances. Let's explore these thoughts further using a thought record. Are you willing to try this with me?\n\nPatient: Yes, I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's start with the thought, \"I should have spent more time with my mother.\" What emotions does this thought bring up for you, and how intense are they on a scale of 0 to 100?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel guilty and sad. I'd say the intensity is around 80.\n\nTherapist: Now, let's look for evidence that supports or refutes this thought. What evidence do you have that you didn't spend enough time with your mother?\n\nPatient: Well, I was often busy with work and didn't visit her as much as I could have, especially during the last few months of her life.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have that contradicts this thought?",
