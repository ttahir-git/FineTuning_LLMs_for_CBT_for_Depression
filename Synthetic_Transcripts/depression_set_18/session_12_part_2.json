  "transcript": "Patient: Growing up, my parents always emphasized the importance of hard work and sacrifice. My father, being in the military, instilled in me the idea that putting others' needs before my own was a sign of strength and character. I think that's where a lot of my guilt around self-care comes from.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable how those messages from your upbringing could contribute to your current beliefs and feelings. Let's explore this further. Can you think of a specific situation recently where you felt guilty for prioritizing self-care?\n\nPatient: Yes, last week I took a half-day off work to go on a hike, something I hadn't done in a long time. While I was on the hike, I couldn't shake the feeling that I should be working instead, and that taking time for myself was selfish.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. Let's use it to practice reframing those thoughts. What would you say is the evidence that supports the thought that taking time for yourself is selfish?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose the evidence is that I was taking time away from work, where I have responsibilities and people counting on me.\n\nTherapist: Okay, and what about the evidence against that thought? What are some reasons why taking time for yourself might not be selfish?\n\nPatient: I guess, in the long run, taking care of myself could actually make me more productive at work. And my mental health is important too \u2013 if I'm always prioritizing work, I might burn out or become resentful.\n\nTherapist: Those are great points, Mei. It's about finding a balance between your responsibilities and your own needs. Let's try to reframe that initial thought. Instead of \"Taking time for myself is selfish,\" how about \"Taking time for myself is an investment in my overall well-being and productivity\"?\n\nPatient: That does sound more balanced. It's just hard to break out of that mindset when it's been reinforced for so long.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it can be challenging to change long-held beliefs. That's why we practice reframing \u2013 it helps us develop new, more adaptive ways of thinking. Remember, it's a process, and it takes time. The more you practice, the more natural it will feel.\n\nPatient: I understand. I'll keep working on it.\n\nTherapist: Great. Now, let's talk about your conversation with Lian. How did it go, and what did you take away from it?\n\nPatient: It was difficult at first because I felt vulnerable sharing my struggles. But Lian was very supportive and understanding. They reminded me that our relationship is a partnership and that it's okay to lean on each other.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. It sounds like the conversation helped you feel more connected to Lian. What do you think this experience says about your belief that putting others' needs first is always necessary?\n\nPatient: I guess it shows that being vulnerable and sharing my own needs can actually strengthen my relationships. It's not always about sacrificing my own well-being.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Interdependence \u2013 relying on each other and supporting one another \u2013 is a sign of a healthy relationship. It's great that you're starting to recognize that.",
