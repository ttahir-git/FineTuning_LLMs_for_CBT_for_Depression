  "transcript": "Patient: When I was working on the project and couldn't spend time with Lian, I kept thinking that I was being a bad partner. I felt like I was neglecting her and not giving her the attention she deserves.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that you felt guilty about not being able to spend time with Lian while you were focused on your work project. Let's explore this thought further. What do you think it means to be a \"bad partner\"?\n\nPatient: I guess I think that a bad partner is someone who doesn't make time for their significant other, someone who prioritizes other things over their relationship.\n\nTherapist: That's a helpful definition. Now, let's consider the evidence for and against the thought that you're a bad partner. What evidence supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, the fact that I was working late and not spending time with Lian during that period seems like evidence that I'm a bad partner.\n\nTherapist: Okay, that's one piece of evidence. Now, let's look at the evidence against this thought. What are some things that contradict the idea that you're a bad partner?\n\nPatient: I suppose the fact that I feel guilty about not spending time with Lian shows that I care about her and our relationship. Also, when I'm not working on a big project, I do make an effort to spend quality time with her and support her.\n\nTherapist: Those are important pieces of evidence to consider. Feeling guilty about not spending time with Lian actually demonstrates that you value your relationship and want to be a good partner. And the fact that you make an effort to spend quality time with her when you're not overwhelmed with work contradicts the thought that you're a bad partner.\n\nLet's try to reframe this thought in a more balanced way. How could you state it differently, taking into account the evidence we just discussed?\n\nPatient: I could say, \"Even though I had to prioritize work during the project, it doesn't mean I'm a bad partner. I feel guilty because I care about Lian and our relationship, and I make an effort to be there for her when I can.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic way of looking at the situation, Mei. Recognizing that having to prioritize work at times doesn't define your entire relationship is an important insight. It's also great that you acknowledge your feelings of guilt as evidence of your care for Lian, rather than as proof that you're a bad partner.\n\nAs we continue to work on challenging these negative thoughts and core beliefs, it's essential to practice self-compassion. Remember that being a good partner doesn't mean being perfect or always putting the other person's needs first. It's about making an effort to balance your own needs with the needs of your relationship.\n\nLet's explore some strategies for managing your mood fluctuations and finding a better balance between work and personal life. One technique that can be helpful is called \"behavioral activation.\" This involves scheduling activities that you enjoy or find meaningful, even when you don't feel motivated to do them. The idea is that engaging in these activities can help improve your mood and give you a sense of accomplishment.\n\nCan you think of some activities that you enjoy or find meaningful that you could schedule into your week?\n\nPatient: I used to enjoy photography and hiking, but I haven't done much of either lately. I suppose I could try to schedule some time on the weekends to go for a hike or work on a photography project.",
