  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like challenging my perfectionistic thoughts and using the coping card. It's been challenging at times, especially when I'm in the midst of strong emotions. I find it hard to generate alternative thoughts in those moments. I've also been feeling guilty about setting boundaries at work and taking breaks for self-care. It goes against what I've always believed \u2013 that I should be constantly working hard and putting others' needs before my own.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that challenging long-held beliefs and patterns of thinking can be difficult. It takes time and practice to shift those thoughts, especially when they're tied to deeply ingrained cultural and family beliefs. I'm glad you've been trying to use the coping card and practice generating alternative thoughts, even if it's been challenging.\n\nLet's explore your feelings of guilt around setting boundaries at work and engaging in self-care. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come up for you in those situations?\n\nPatient: When I try to set boundaries at work, like saying no to additional projects or leaving work on time, I feel like I'm not being a team player. I worry that my colleagues will think I'm lazy or not committed enough. And when I take breaks for self-care, I feel guilty for not using that time to be productive. I hear my father's voice in my head, telling me that rest is for the weak and that I should always be striving to do more.\n\nTherapist: Those are powerful thoughts and beliefs that have been reinforced over many years. It's not surprising that they're difficult to change. Let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts, just like we've practiced with the thought records.\n\nWhat evidence do you have that your colleagues will think you're lazy or not committed if you set boundaries at work?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I don't have any direct evidence. No one has actually said that to me. But I assume that's what they're thinking because that's what I would think if someone else set those boundaries.\n\nTherapist: That's an important insight \u2013 you're assuming others are thinking the same way you do, but you don't have concrete evidence to support that assumption. Let's consider an alternative perspective. Is it possible that your colleagues also value work-life balance and would understand the need for boundaries?\n\nPatient: I suppose it's possible. Some of my coworkers do leave work on time and seem to have hobbies and interests outside of work. Maybe they would understand.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point. It's possible that your assumptions about others' thoughts are not entirely accurate. Now, let's look at the belief that rest is for the weak and you should always be striving to do more. Where do you think this belief comes from?\n\nPatient: It definitely comes from my family, especially my father. He always emphasized the importance of hard work and sacrifice. He would often say things like, \"No one ever achieved greatness by taking breaks.\"\n\nTherapist: It makes sense that this belief is so deeply ingrained, given your family background. But let's examine it more closely. Is it true that no one ever achieved greatness by taking breaks? Can you think of any examples that contradict this belief?\n\nPatient: Well, now that I think about it, there are probably many successful people who do take breaks and prioritize self-care. I remember reading about how some famous CEOs and entrepreneurs make time for exercise, hobbies, and family, even in the midst of running big companies.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. It challenges the notion that rest and self-care are incompatible with success and achievement. In fact, taking care of oneself can actually enhance productivity and overall well-being in the long run.\n\nLet's set an agenda for today's session. We can continue exploring these beliefs around work, rest, and self-care, and practice generating alternative thoughts. We can also review your homework from last session and discuss any challenges that came up. Does that sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm also wondering if we could talk more about my relationship with my partner, Lian. I've been feeling guilty about not being as present and engaged as I'd like to be, because of my depression and work stress.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely include that in our agenda. Relationships can be impacted by depression, and it's important to address those challenges. Let's start by reviewing your homework, and then we'll dive into the topics you've mentioned.",
