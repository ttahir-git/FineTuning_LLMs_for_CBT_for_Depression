  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's good to see you again for our sixth session. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your support. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the coping strategies we discussed. I've been doing the thought records and practicing the relaxation techniques, but it's been challenging at times. Work has been particularly stressful, and I've been struggling with feelings of worthlessness and guilt.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Mei. It's common to face challenges when implementing new coping strategies, especially when dealing with stressors like work. Let's explore your experiences further. Can you tell me more about the situations that triggered feelings of worthlessness and guilt?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been working on a big project at work, and I feel like I'm not contributing enough. I keep thinking that I should be doing more, and that my colleagues are disappointed in me. Even when I receive positive feedback, I have a hard time believing it.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive distortions, particularly \"should statements\" and discounting the positive. Remember, these types of thoughts are common in depression, but they're not accurate reflections of reality. Let's set an agenda for today's session to help you address these challenges. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing my thoughts and emotions related to work. I also want to discuss how I can better cope with the upcoming anniversary of my mother's passing. And maybe we could review the thought records I've been doing.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan, Mei. We can start by reviewing your thought records and discussing any patterns or insights you've noticed. Then, we can explore strategies for managing work-related stress and emotions, and prepare for the upcoming anniversary of your mother's passing. How does that sound?",
