  "transcript": "Patient: Last session, we discussed setting boundaries at work and challenging my negative thoughts about self-care. For homework, you asked me to continue practicing thought records, use the Positive Data Log, and be more assertive at work. I've been trying to implement these strategies, but it's been challenging at times.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty about the challenges you've faced with the homework. Let's dive deeper into your experiences. Can you share a specific situation where you found it difficult to set boundaries or challenge negative thoughts about self-care?\n\nPatient: Sure. Earlier this week, I was feeling overwhelmed with work and wanted to take a short break to go for a walk. However, as soon as I stepped away from my desk, I started feeling guilty. I had thoughts like, \"I should be working, not taking a break\" and \"My colleagues will think I'm lazy.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. Let's explore this further using the thought record. What emotions did you experience when you had those thoughts?\n\nPatient: I felt guilty, anxious, and a bit frustrated with myself.\n\nTherapist: And how intense were those emotions on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: The guilt was probably around 80, anxiety around 70, and frustration around 60.\n\nTherapist: Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought, \"I should be working, not taking a break.\" What evidence supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, there's always a lot of work to be done, and I don't want to fall behind. My colleagues are working hard, and I feel like I should be doing the same.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence goes against this thought?\n\nPatient: I know that taking breaks is important for my mental health and productivity. In our previous sessions, we discussed how self-care can actually improve my work performance in the long run.\n\nTherapist: Great. Now, let's consider an alternative thought that takes both sides into account. What might be a more balanced way of looking at this situation?\n\nPatient: Perhaps something like, \"Taking short breaks is essential for my well-being and can help me be more focused and productive when I return to work.\"\n\nTherapist: I like that alternative thought. It acknowledges the importance of your work while also recognizing the value of self-care. If you were to believe this alternative thought, how do you think it would impact the intensity of your emotions?\n\nPatient: I think my guilt would decrease significantly, maybe down to 30 or 40. My anxiety and frustration would also be lower, perhaps around 30-50.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. By challenging the initial negative thought and considering a more balanced perspective, you're able to reduce the intensity of your emotions. This is a key aspect of cognitive restructuring.\n\nNow, let's discuss how you can apply this process in real-time when you notice these negative thoughts arising. One technique is to use a coping card, which is a small card with reminders of your alternative thoughts and the evidence supporting them. You can keep this card with you and refer to it when you need a reminder of the more balanced perspective.\n\nPatient: That sounds helpful. I can write down some of the alternative thoughts we've discussed on a card and keep it in my wallet or on my desk.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Using coping cards can be a great way to reinforce the work we're doing in therapy and help you challenge negative thoughts in the moment.\n\nAnother technique we can use to further explore the roots of these negative thoughts is the downward arrow technique. This involves asking yourself, \"If this thought were true, what would it mean about me?\" and continuing to dig deeper until you reach the core belief underlying the thought.\n\nFor example, if we take the thought, \"My colleagues will think I'm lazy,\" and ask, \"If that were true, what would it mean about me?\" what might come up for you?\n\nPatient: If my colleagues thought I was lazy, it would mean that I'm not a hard worker, and I'm not contributing to the team.\n\nTherapist: And if that were true, what would it mean about you?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not valuable or worthy of respect.\n\nTherapist: As we continue this process, we might uncover a core belief such as, \"I'm only valuable if I'm constantly working hard and putting others' needs before my own.\" Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that's a belief I've held for a long time, probably due to my family and cultural background.\n\nTherapist: That's a valuable insight. By identifying this core belief, we can start to work on reframing it and developing a more balanced and compassionate perspective. We'll continue to explore this in our future sessions.\n\nI want to acknowledge the progress you've made in recognizing and challenging these negative thoughts. It's not an easy process, but you're taking important steps towards improving your mental health and well-being.\n\nPatient: Thank you. It's helpful to understand where these thoughts are coming from and to have tools to challenge them.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. Remember that change takes time, and it's normal to have setbacks along the way. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you continue to practice these skills.\n\nBefore we move on to discussing communication with your partner, Lian, do you have any other questions or concerns about the techniques we've covered so far?",
