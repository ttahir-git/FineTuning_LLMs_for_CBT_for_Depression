  "transcript": "Patient: I guess I did call her regularly and visited when I could. I also helped her with groceries and errands when she needed it. It's just hard to remember those things when I'm feeling guilty.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Mei. When we're feeling strong emotions like guilt, it can be difficult to see the bigger picture. Based on the evidence you provided, is there an alternative thought that might be more balanced and compassionate?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could say that while I wish I had spent more time with my mother, I did show my love and support in the ways I could, given my circumstances.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful reframe, Mei. How does this alternative thought make you feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It still hurts, but I feel a bit less guilty. Maybe around 50 instead of 80.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, Mei. Reframing our thoughts can help us find a more balanced perspective and reduce the intensity of our emotions. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to challenge cognitive distortions like \"should statements.\"\n\nNow, let's discuss how your depression has been affecting your work. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing?\n\nPatient: I've been struggling to concentrate and stay motivated at work. I feel like I'm not performing as well as I used to, and it's making me worry about my job security.\n\nTherapist: I understand how that can be concerning, Mei. Depression can often impact our work performance, but there are strategies we can use to manage these challenges. One approach is to break tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This can help you feel a sense of accomplishment and progress, even when you're struggling with motivation.\n\nLet's practice this together. Can you think of a work-related task that feels overwhelming right now?\n\nPatient: Well, I have a big project coming up with a tight deadline, and I'm worried I won't be able to focus and get it done on time.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's break this project down into smaller steps. What would be the first step you could take to move forward?\n\nPatient: I guess I could start by creating an outline and identifying the key components of the project.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. That's a clear and manageable first step. Once you've created the outline, what might be the next step?\n\nPatient: I could then focus on researching and gathering the necessary information for each component.\n\nTherapist: That's a great second step. By breaking the project down into smaller tasks, it becomes less overwhelming and more achievable. As you complete each step, take a moment to acknowledge your progress and the effort you've put in. This can help counteract feelings of worthlessness and build a sense of accomplishment.\n\nRemember, Mei, depression can make it difficult to concentrate and stay motivated, but by using strategies like breaking tasks into smaller steps and acknowledging your progress, you can continue to move forward despite these challenges.",
