  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for our 19th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me throughout our sessions. Since our last meeting, I've been doing relatively well. I've been practicing the thought records and challenging my perfectionistic thoughts, especially when it comes to work and my relationship with Lian. I shared my self-care list with her, and we scheduled a hiking trip for next weekend, which I'm looking forward to. I've also been reviewing my coping cards and wellness action plan regularly, and I feel more confident in managing my mental health independently. However, I do feel a bit nervous about our therapy sessions coming to an end.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that you've been consistently applying the skills and strategies we've discussed in our sessions. Scheduling a hiking trip with Lian is a great way to prioritize self-care and engage in activities you enjoy. It's also understandable to feel nervous about ending therapy. We've been working together for quite some time, and it's a significant transition. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. What specific concerns do you have about ending therapy?\n\nPatient: I think I'm worried that without our regular sessions, I might slip back into old patterns of thinking and behavior. Even though I feel more confident now, there's still a part of me that doubts my ability to maintain this progress on my own.\n\nTherapist: It's common to have doubts and concerns about maintaining progress after therapy ends. That's why we've been focusing on building your self-efficacy and creating a personalized toolbox of skills and strategies. Remember, the end of therapy doesn't mean you're alone in this journey. You have Lian's support, and you can always reach out if you need additional guidance in the future. Today, let's work on reinforcing your learning and developing a plan for maintaining your progress. What would you like to prioritize in our agenda for this session?",
