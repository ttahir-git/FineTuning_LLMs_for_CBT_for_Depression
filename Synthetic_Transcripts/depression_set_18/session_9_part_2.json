  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I'm particularly interested in discussing the impact of my cultural and family beliefs on my thoughts and behaviors related to self-care.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Mei. Our cultural and family backgrounds can have a significant influence on our beliefs and behaviors. Let's start by reviewing your homework from the last session. How did you find the process of using thought records to challenge negative thoughts related to work and self-worth?\n\nPatient: I found the thought records to be a helpful tool for identifying and challenging my negative thoughts. It was eye-opening to see how often I engage in negative self-talk and how it affects my mood. However, I struggled with coming up with alternative thoughts that felt believable to me.\n\nTherapist: It's common to find it challenging to come up with alternative thoughts at first, especially if the negative thoughts have been present for a long time. The goal is to develop more balanced and realistic thoughts, not necessarily overly positive ones. Can you share an example of a negative thought you struggled to reframe?\n\nPatient: Sure. One thought that kept coming up was, \"I'm not doing enough at work, and I'm letting my team down.\" When I tried to come up with an alternative thought, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was just making excuses for myself.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Mei. Let's break it down together. What evidence did you have for and against the thought that you're not doing enough at work?\n\nPatient: The evidence for the thought was that I've been taking more breaks lately and leaving work on time instead of staying late. The evidence against the thought is that I'm still meeting my deadlines and receiving positive feedback from my colleagues and supervisor.\n\nTherapist: That's a great analysis, Mei. It shows that there is evidence against the negative thought, even if it doesn't feel as strong as the evidence for the thought. One technique we can use to develop a more balanced alternative thought is to combine the evidence for and against the negative thought. For example, an alternative thought could be, \"Although I'm taking more breaks and leaving work on time, I'm still meeting my deadlines and receiving positive feedback, which suggests that I'm performing adequately at work.\"\n\nPatient: That does sound more balanced. I guess I've been focusing more on the evidence that supports my negative thoughts and disregarding the evidence against them.\n\nTherapist: That's a common cognitive distortion called \"disqualifying the positive,\" where we tend to dismiss or minimize positive experiences or feedback. By consciously focusing on the evidence against our negative thoughts, we can develop more balanced and realistic perspectives. As you continue practicing this skill, it will become easier to generate alternative thoughts that feel more believable to you.",
