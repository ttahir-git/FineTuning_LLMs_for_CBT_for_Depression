  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like the 5-5-5 mindfulness technique and the Positive Data Log. I've noticed some improvement in my mood, but I still struggle with feelings of guilt around self-care and prioritizing work. It's been challenging to break free from these thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we discussed and have noticed some improvement in your mood. It's understandable that you're still struggling with feelings of guilt around self-care and work priorities. These thoughts are often deeply ingrained and can take time to change. Let's explore this further today. What would you like to focus on in our session?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing the guilt I feel when I take breaks or engage in self-care. It's something that keeps coming up for me, and I want to find ways to cope with it more effectively.\n\nTherapist: That's a great topic to focus on today. We can also review your Positive Data Log and see how that's been helping you challenge your negative thoughts. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm also wondering if we could discuss some strategies for setting boundaries at work. I find it hard to say no to additional tasks, even when I'm already overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss setting boundaries at work. Learning to say no and prioritize your well-being is an important skill. So, for today's agenda, we have:\n1. Managing guilt around self-care\n2. Reviewing your Positive Data Log\n3. Discussing strategies for setting boundaries at work\nIs there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it. Let's start with managing the guilt around self-care.",
