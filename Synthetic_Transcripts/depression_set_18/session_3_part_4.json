  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate your support and encouragement, Nova. It means a lot to know that you're here to guide me through this process.\n\nTherapist: I'm happy to be here for you, Mei. Before we wrap up today's session, let's review the goals and treatment plan we've established. Your main goals are to feel more in control of your thoughts and emotions, improve communication with your partner Lian, and engage in activities that promote positive emotions. Our treatment plan includes regular practice of thought records, developing coping strategies like relaxation techniques and mindfulness, working on communication skills, and encouraging behavioral activation through activities you enjoy. How do you feel about this plan?\n\nPatient: I feel good about it. It covers the areas I want to work on, and I appreciate that we'll be taking it at a pace that's comfortable for me.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Mei. To help you continue making progress between sessions, I'd like to assign some homework. First, I'd like you to continue practicing thought records, focusing on challenging negative thoughts related to work and your sense of self-worth. Aim to complete at least one thought record per day. Second, I'd like you to practice a relaxation technique, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, for 5-10 minutes each day. There are many guided relaxation exercises available online that you can try. Finally, I'd like you to engage in at least one activity related to photography or hiking, even if it's just for a short period. The goal is to create opportunities for positive experiences and a sense of accomplishment. How do you feel about this homework?\n\nPatient: It sounds manageable. I'll do my best to complete the thought records and try the relaxation techniques. I'll also plan an activity related to photography or hiking.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Mei. Remember, the homework is meant to support your progress, not to add stress. If you find any of the assignments challenging, we can discuss it in our next session and make adjustments as needed.\n\nSession Summary:\nMain topics discussed:\n- Reviewed and finalized therapy goals (feeling more in control of thoughts and emotions, improving communication with partner, engaging in activities that promote positive emotions)\n- Established treatment plan (practicing thought records, developing coping strategies, working on communication skills, encouraging behavioral activation)\n- Discussed concerns about therapy process and progress\n- Introduced relaxation techniques as homework\n\nTechniques or exercises used:\n- Thought records to challenge negative thoughts related to work and self-worth (patient will continue practicing as homework)\n- Introduced relaxation techniques (deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation) for managing difficult emotions (patient will practice as homework)\n- Encouraged behavioral activation through engaging in activities related to photography or hiking (patient will plan an activity as homework)\n\nHomework assigned:\n1.
