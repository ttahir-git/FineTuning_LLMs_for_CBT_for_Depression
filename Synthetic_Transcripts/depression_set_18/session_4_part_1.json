  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for our fourth session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week, but I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned. I completed a few thought records and practiced the relaxation techniques, but I didn't get a chance to engage in any activities related to photography or hiking.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Mei. It's great that you were able to practice the thought records and relaxation techniques. We can explore what made it difficult to engage in photography or hiking activities. Before we dive into that, let's do a more thorough check-in. Can you tell me a bit more about your mood and any significant experiences you've had since our last session?\n\nPatient: My mood has been low, and I've been feeling more fatigued than usual. Work has been particularly stressful, and I've been struggling to keep up with the demands. I've also been thinking a lot about my mother and the upcoming anniversary of her passing.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stress and emotional pain. Losing a loved one is never easy, and anniversaries can be particularly challenging. We can definitely explore these feelings further. Given what you've shared, what would you like to prioritize in today's session?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing my stress levels and finding ways to cope with the upcoming anniversary of my mother's passing. I'm also worried about my performance at work and how it might be affected by my depression.\n\nTherapist: Those are important topics to address. Let's add them to our agenda for today. We can start by discussing the stress you've been experiencing at work and explore some coping strategies. Then, we can talk about the upcoming anniversary of your mother's passing and how you can prepare for it emotionally. We'll also touch on how your depression might be impacting your work performance and discuss ways to manage that. Does this agenda sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I'm hoping to find some ways to better manage my stress and emotions, especially with the anniversary coming up.\n\nTherapist: I understand. Let's start by discussing the stress you've been experiencing at work. Can you tell me more about what's been happening and how it's been affecting you?",
