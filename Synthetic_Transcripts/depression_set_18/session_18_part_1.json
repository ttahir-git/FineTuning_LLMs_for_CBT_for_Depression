  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for our 18th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate, and I want to remind you that if you ever experience thoughts of self-harm or suicide, it's crucial to seek immediate help from a qualified professional, as I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations. With that said, how have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like challenging my perfectionistic thoughts and using \"I\" statements when communicating with Lian. It's been challenging at times, but I do feel like I'm making some progress. I've also been trying to be more aware of how my cultural background and family beliefs influence my thoughts and behaviors.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on applying the techniques we've discussed, Mei. Recognizing the influence of your cultural background and family beliefs is an important step in the process. Can you share a specific example of how you've challenged a perfectionistic thought related to work or your relationship with Lian?\n\nPatient: Well, last week, I found myself feeling guilty for taking a break during work to go for a short walk. My initial thought was, \"I should be working right now, not taking a break.\" But then I tried to challenge that thought by reminding myself that taking breaks is actually important for my productivity and well-being. I also remembered our discussions about how my family's emphasis on hard work and self-sacrifice has contributed to my perfectionistic tendencies.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how you've been able to apply the thought-challenging techniques we've practiced. Recognizing the connection between your family's values and your own thoughts and behaviors is a significant insight. How did you feel after challenging that thought and taking the break?\n\nPatient: I felt a sense of relief and even a bit of pride for prioritizing my own needs. It was a small step, but it felt like progress. I also noticed that I was able to focus better when I returned to work.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Mei. It's empowering to see how challenging our thoughts and making small changes in our behavior can have a positive impact on our well-being. Now, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to continue exploring how my cultural background and family beliefs influence my thoughts and behaviors, especially when it comes to self-care and setting boundaries. I also want to discuss how I can continue to improve my communication with Lian and manage my perfectionistic thoughts related to work.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on, Mei. I'd also like to spend some time reviewing your Positive Data Log and the progress you've made so far in therapy. Additionally, we can discuss some strategies for maintaining your progress and managing potential setbacks as we approach the end of our sessions together. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I'm looking forward to discussing these topics and getting your guidance on how to maintain my progress moving forward.",
