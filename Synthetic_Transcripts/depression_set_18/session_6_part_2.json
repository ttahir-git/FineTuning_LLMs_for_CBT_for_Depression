  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for the CBT session:\n\nPatient: I've been trying to do the thought records, but sometimes I get stuck on identifying the evidence for and against my thoughts. It's hard to challenge these long-held beliefs about myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Mei. Challenging long-held beliefs can be difficult, especially when they're tied to our sense of self-worth. Let's look at one of your thought records together and see if we can find some evidence to help you challenge those beliefs. Can you share an example of a thought you struggled with?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I was working on a project, and I kept thinking, \"I should be able to do this faster. My colleagues probably think I'm incompetent.\" I had a hard time finding evidence against that thought.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Mei. When we've held a belief for a long time, it can be challenging to find evidence against it. In this case, let's break down the thought and look for evidence together. Have your colleagues ever expressed concerns about your competence or the speed of your work?\n\nPatient: Well, not directly. But I feel like they might be thinking that.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point. Sometimes our assumptions about what others think can fuel our negative thoughts. Let's focus on the evidence we have. Have you received any positive feedback on your work recently?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. My manager complimented my work on a different project last month. But I keep dismissing that feedback, thinking they're just being nice.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of discounting the positive, another cognitive distortion. It's important to give equal weight to the positive evidence. Recognizing and accepting positive feedback can help challenge the belief that your colleagues think you're incompetent. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I guess you're right. I should try to focus more on the positive feedback I've received and not just assume what others are thinking.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Challenging these thoughts takes practice, and it's okay if it feels difficult at first. As we continue to work on thought records, you'll likely find it easier to identify evidence against your negative thoughts. Remember, the goal is to develop a more balanced perspective.",
