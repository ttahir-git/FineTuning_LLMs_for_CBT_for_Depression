  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for our second session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few important things about our work together. As an AI therapist, there are some limitations to what I can do. I don't have access to any information about you beyond what you share with me in our sessions. I'm also not able to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel like you're in crisis, it's important to reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Additionally, since our communication is text-based, I can't observe your body language or other non-verbal cues. I'll do my best to understand your experiences based on what you share with me in writing. Does this all make sense? Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, thanks for explaining that. I understand the limitations and I'm here because I want to work on my depression through CBT. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great, I'm glad to hear that. Before we jump into reviewing your homework, let's take a moment to set an agenda for our session today. This helps us stay focused and make the most of our time together. Based on what we discussed last time, I think it would be helpful to:\n\n1. Review your mood journal and discuss any insights or challenges that came up \n2. Continue exploring the CBT framework, particularly the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors\n3. Start identifying some of the specific negative thought patterns that may be contributing to your depression\n\nDoes this sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to make sure we cover today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm particularly interested in discussing the connection between my thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. I've noticed some patterns in my mood journal that I want to explore.\n\nTherapist: Excellent, we'll definitely dive into that. Let's start by reviewing your mood journal. Can you share some of the insights you gained from tracking your moods, events, and thoughts over the past week?",
