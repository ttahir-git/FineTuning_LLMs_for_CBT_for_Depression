  "transcript": "Patient: I think I'd like to prioritize reinforcing my learning and building my confidence in maintaining progress. I know we've covered a lot of ground in our sessions, but I want to make sure I have a solid grasp of the skills and strategies we've discussed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Mei. Reinforcing your learning and building your confidence will be key to your continued success after our sessions end. Let's start by reviewing some of the core CBT concepts and techniques we've covered. Can you explain to me, in your own words, how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are connected?\n\nPatient: Well, from what I understand, our thoughts influence our feelings, which in turn influence our behaviors. For example, if I have the thought, \"I'm not good enough,\" it might lead to feelings of sadness or worthlessness, which could then lead to behaviors like withdrawing from others or not engaging in activities I enjoy.\n\nTherapist: That's exactly right, Mei. You've done a great job of summarizing the CBT triangle. Now, let's think about how we can apply this understanding to your specific situation. Can you give me an example of a time recently when you noticed this connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just last week, I had a thought that I wasn't doing enough at work, even though I had completed all my tasks for the day. This thought led to feelings of guilt and anxiety, which then led me to stay late at the office, even though I didn't really need to.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Mei. And how did you handle that situation, given what you've learned in our sessions?\n\nPatient: I caught myself in the moment and decided to do a thought record. I challenged the thought by looking at the evidence \u2013 I had completed all my tasks, and there was no urgent need for me to stay late. I reminded myself that taking breaks and prioritizing self-care is important, and that my worth isn't solely defined by my work. After doing the thought record, I decided to leave the office on time and spend the evening doing something I enjoyed.\n\nTherapist: Mei, I'm so impressed by how you handled that situation. You not only recognized the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, but you also took active steps to challenge the unhelpful thoughts and make a healthier choice for yourself. This is a perfect example of how you can continue to apply the skills you've learned in therapy to your daily life.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It feels good to know that I can handle these situations differently now. I guess I'm just worried that I might not always be able to catch myself in the moment like that.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, Mei. And the truth is, there may be times when you don't catch yourself in the moment. But the more you practice these skills, the more automatic they'll become. It's like building a muscle \u2013 the more you use it, the stronger it gets. And even if there are times when you don't catch yourself right away, you can always go back and do a thought record after the fact to help you process the situation and learn from it.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just need to keep practicing and trust that it will get easier over time.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And remember, you don't have to do this alone. You have your toolbox of skills and strategies, your coping cards, and your wellness action plan. You also have Lian's support, and you can always reach out for additional guidance if you need it. You've made so much progress, Mei, and I have full confidence in your ability to continue this work independently.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. That means a lot to me. I feel more hopeful knowing that I have these tools and supports in place.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mei. Let's take a moment to check in with how you're feeling now, after reviewing your progress and discussing your concerns about ending therapy. What emotions are coming up for you?\n\nPatient: I feel a mix of emotions, to be honest. I feel proud of the progress I've made and grateful for the tools and strategies I've learned. At the same time, I feel a bit sad about ending our sessions and nervous about navigating things on my own.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions right now. Ending therapy is a significant transition, and it's okay to feel both proud and sad, both grateful and nervous. The important thing is that you're allowing yourself to feel these emotions and that you're acknowledging them without judgment.\n\nPatient: You're right. It's okay to feel all of these things. And I know that just because our sessions are ending doesn't mean I'm completely on my own. I have my toolbox, and I have Lian, and I can always reach out if I need to.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Mei. You've got this. And remember, endings are also beginnings. The end of our sessions together is the beginning of a new phase in your journey \u2013 a phase where you get to take all the skills and insights you've gained and apply them in your daily life, in your own way.\n\nPatient: I like that perspective. It feels more empowering to think of it as a new beginning rather than just an ending.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that resonates with you, Mei. As we move into this new phase, let's talk a bit about how you can continue to support yourself going forward. We've already talked about your toolbox and your support system, but let's think about some specific self-care practices you can commit to in the coming weeks and months.",
