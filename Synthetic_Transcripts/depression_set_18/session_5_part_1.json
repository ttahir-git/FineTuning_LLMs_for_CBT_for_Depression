  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for our fifth session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week, but I've been trying to apply the techniques we discussed. I completed some thought records and practiced the relaxation techniques, which helped a bit. I also went on a short hike with Lian, which was nice. However, the anniversary of my mother's passing is coming up, and I've been feeling more emotional lately.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your openness about the challenges you've been facing. It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we discussed and even went on a hike with Lian. At the same time, I acknowledge that the upcoming anniversary of your mother's passing is bringing up strong emotions for you. Let's make sure to discuss this further during our session today. How would you feel about setting an agenda for our meeting?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I think I'd like to talk more about coping with my mother's anniversary and the emotions that come with it. I also want to discuss how my depression has been affecting my work and explore ways to manage that better.\n\nTherapist: Those are important topics to focus on. Let's add them to our agenda. We can start by discussing the emotions you've been experiencing related to your mother's anniversary and explore coping strategies. Then, we can move on to discussing the impact of depression on your work and identify ways to manage it more effectively. Does this agenda feel comfortable for you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main things on my mind right now. Let's start with discussing my mother's anniversary.",
