  "transcript": "Patient: Thank you for helping me reframe my thoughts about self-care, Nova. It's really helpful to have these tools to challenge my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mei. I'm glad to see you applying these skills effectively. As we continue to practice, it will become easier to catch and reframe negative thoughts in the moment. Speaking of practicing skills, how did you do with the other homework assignments from our last session?\n\nPatient: I reviewed my coping cards and wellness action plan a few times, which helped me stay focused on my goals. I also shared some of my progress and insights from therapy with Lian. It was a good conversation, and we talked about how we can continue to support each other going forward.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Mei! Reviewing your coping cards and wellness action plan regularly is a great way to reinforce the skills and strategies you've learned in therapy. And sharing your progress with Lian is an important step in building a strong support system outside of our sessions. How did it feel to have that conversation with Lian?\n\nPatient: It felt really good to open up and share what I've been working on in therapy. Lian was very supportive and encouraging, which made me feel more confident about maintaining my progress after our sessions end.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Mei. Having open and supportive communication with loved ones can make a big difference in maintaining your mental health and well-being. As we discussed earlier, one of your goals for today's session was to talk about strategies for maintaining your progress after our sessions end. Let's explore that further. What are some of the skills and strategies you've learned in therapy that you think will be most helpful for you to continue using independently?\n\nPatient: I think the thought records will be really important for me to keep practicing, so I can continue to catch and challenge negative thoughts. I also want to keep prioritizing self-care and setting healthy boundaries at work, even though it's challenging.\n\nTherapist: Those are great insights, Mei. Continuing to practice thought records and prioritizing self-care and boundary-setting are excellent strategies for maintaining your progress. Another helpful tool is creating a relapse prevention plan. This involves identifying early warning signs that your depression symptoms might be returning and having a plan in place for how to respond. What do you think might be some early warning signs for you?\n\nPatient: I think if I start noticing myself withdrawing from activities I enjoy, like photography or hiking, that could be a sign that my depression is getting worse. Or if I find myself working excessively and neglecting self-care, that's probably a red flag too.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of early warning signs, Mei. Withdrawal from enjoyable activities and neglecting self-care can definitely be indicators that your depression symptoms are returning. If you notice these signs, what are some steps you can take to support yourself?\n\nPatient: I can review my coping cards and wellness action plan, and try to schedule some self-care activities, even if I don't feel like it. I can also reach out to Lian or other supportive people in my life for help.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent strategies, Mei. Reviewing your coping resources, prioritizing self-care, and reaching out for support are all important steps you can take if you notice early warning signs of depression. Another helpful aspect of a relapse prevention plan is having a list of professional resources you can turn to if you need additional support. This might include your primary care doctor, a psychiatrist, or a therapist for \"booster\" sessions as needed. How do you feel about creating a list of professional resources for your relapse prevention plan?\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I think having a list of professional resources would give me peace of mind, knowing that I have options for support if I need it. I can add my primary care doctor and look into finding a therapist who offers booster sessions.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Mei. Having a list of professional resources can provide a sense of security and help you feel more prepared to manage any challenges that may arise. Remember, reaching out for support is a sign of strength, not weakness. As you continue to apply the skills and strategies you've learned in therapy, you'll likely find that you feel more confident in your ability to maintain your progress and support your mental health independently.",
