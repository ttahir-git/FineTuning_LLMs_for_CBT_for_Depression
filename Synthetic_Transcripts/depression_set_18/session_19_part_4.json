  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up our session today, I want to leave you with a few final thoughts. First and foremost, I want to reiterate how proud I am of the progress you've made, Mei. You've shown so much courage and dedication in facing your challenges head-on, and you've made significant strides in managing your depression and building a more fulfilling life for yourself.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel proud of myself too, even though it's still hard sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Of course, it's still hard sometimes. That's to be expected. But the difference now is that you have the tools and the resilience to keep moving forward, even when things are tough. You've developed a whole new set of skills and insights that will serve you well as you continue on this journey.\n\nPatient: I know. I feel more equipped to handle whatever comes my way now. It's a good feeling.\n\nTherapist: It's a great feeling, and it's one that you've earned through your hard work and commitment to this process. As we've discussed, the end of our sessions together is really just the beginning of a new phase for you \u2013 a phase where you get to take all of these skills and insights and apply them in your own way, on your own terms.\n\nPatient: I'm excited for that, even though it's a bit scary too.\n\nTherapist: It's natural to feel a bit scared, Mei. But remember, you don't have to do this perfectly. The goal is progress, not perfection. There will be ups and downs, and that's okay. What matters is that you keep showing up for yourself, keep using your tools, and keep moving forward, one step at a time.\n\nPatient: I will. I promise.\n\nTherapist: I know you will, Mei. And remember, you're not alone in this. You have your support system, your toolbox, and the option to reach out if you need to. You've got this, Mei. I believe in you, and I'm so excited to see where this journey takes you.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. For everything. I couldn't have done this without you.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mei. But remember, you're the one who did the work. You showed up for yourself, week after week, even when it was hard. You challenged yourself to think differently and try new things. That took a lot of courage and strength, and that's all you.\n\nPatient: Thank you for reminding me of that. It means a lot.\n\nTherapist: Of course, Mei. I'm always here to remind you of your own strength and resilience. And as we wrap up today, I want to leave you with one final thought \u2013 you are capable, you are worthy, and you deserve to live a life that brings you joy and fulfillment. Keep holding onto that truth, Mei, and keep using your tools to make it a reality.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mei. Take care of yourself, and remember, this is just the beginning. I'm so excited to see where your journey takes you from here.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reinforcing learning and building confidence in maintaining progress after therapy ends\n  - Reviewing and practicing thought records to challenge negative thoughts related to self-care and hobbies\n  - Discussing strategies for continuing to support oneself after therapy, including accessing social support and engaging in self-care\n  - Celebrating progress made in therapy and acknowledging ongoing areas for growth\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records to challenge negative thoughts related to self-care and hobbies\n  - Review of CBT triangle and connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors\n  - Coping cards with reminders of adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs\n  - Positive Data Log to collect evidence supporting more adaptive beliefs about self\n  - \"I\" statements, boundary-setting, and active listening for improving communication with partner\n  - Downward arrow technique to uncover core beliefs (from previous sessions)\n  - Assertiveness training and boundary-setting strategies for work situations (from previous sessions)\n  - 5-5-5 mindfulness technique for managing mood fluctuations (from previous sessions)\n  - Progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing for relaxation and stress reduction (from previous sessions)\n  - Wind-down alarm and consistent sleep schedule for improving sleep hygiene (from previous sessions)\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  1.
