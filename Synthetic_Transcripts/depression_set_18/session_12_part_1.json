  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to remind you that while I'm here to support you, I do have some limitations as an AI therapist. I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm committed to working with you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your support. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the 5-5-5 mindfulness exercise and scheduling self-care activities. I had a conversation with Lian about my feelings of guilt and the need for a better work-life balance. It was difficult, but it helped me feel a bit more understood.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and had that important conversation with Lian. How did the mindfulness exercise and self-care activities impact your mood and overall well-being?\n\nPatient: The mindfulness exercise helped me feel more grounded when I started to feel overwhelmed. Scheduling self-care activities was challenging because I felt guilty for taking time for myself, but I did manage to go on a short hike, which reminded me of how much I used to enjoy being in nature.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant step forward, Mei. Recognizing the benefits of these techniques, even when it's challenging, is an essential part of the process. Let's discuss your feelings of guilt around self-care a bit more. Can you tell me more about what thoughts come up when you prioritize your own needs?\n\nPatient: When I take time for myself, I often think that I'm being selfish or not working hard enough. I worry that I'm not meeting expectations at work or being a good partner to Lian.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mei. It's common for people to struggle with feelings of guilt when they start prioritizing self-care, especially when they hold beliefs about the importance of hard work and putting others' needs first. Today, I'd like to explore these thoughts further and work on reframing them. We can also discuss your conversation with Lian and how it might relate to these beliefs. Does that sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I want to work on these feelings of guilt and find a way to balance my needs with my responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's add that to our agenda for today. We can also review your thought records and discuss any challenges you faced while using them. Is there anything else you'd like to prioritize in our session today?\n\nPatient: I'd like to talk more about how my cultural background and family beliefs might be influencing my thoughts and feelings around self-care and work.\n\nTherapist: That's an important topic, and I'm glad you brought it up. We can definitely explore how your cultural background and family beliefs might be shaping your thoughts and behaviors. To start, can you tell me more about the messages you received growing up about work, self-care, and prioritizing others' needs?",
