  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great progress today, Mei. We've explored how to challenge cognitive distortions like \"should statements\" related to your mother's passing, and we've discussed strategies for managing the impact of depression on your work. I want to acknowledge the effort you've put into our sessions and the courage it takes to face these challenges.\n\nAs we wrap up, I'd like to assign some homework to help you continue practicing the skills we've discussed. First, I encourage you to complete at least one thought record per day, focusing on challenging any cognitive distortions related to your mother's passing or your work performance. Remember to look for evidence that supports and refutes your thoughts, and try to find a more balanced perspective.\n\nSecond, continue practicing the distress tolerance techniques we've covered, such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. Aim to practice for 5-10 minutes each day, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed.\n\nFinally, I'd like you to plan and engage in at least one activity related to photography or hiking. This can help you continue building a sense of accomplishment and pleasure outside of work.\n\nHow do you feel about these homework assignments, Mei? Do you have any questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: The homework assignments seem manageable, and I think they'll be helpful. I don't have any questions right now, but I'll let you know if something comes up.\n\nTherapist: Great. Remember, the homework is meant to support your progress, so if you find any of the assignments challenging, we can always discuss and adjust them as needed.\n\nBefore we end our session, I'd like to do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now, and do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better than when we started. Talking about my mother and work was difficult, but I feel like I have some new tools to help me cope. I'm still worried about the upcoming anniversary, but I think planning a meaningful activity will help.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to still feel some apprehension about the anniversary, but I'm glad you're considering ways to honor your mother's memory. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time and be gentle with yourself during this process.\n\nThank you for your hard work today, Mei. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's plan to meet again next week to review your homework and continue our work together. In the meantime, if you need any support, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Challenging cognitive distortions (\"should statements\") related to the patient's mother's passing\n  - Managing the impact of depression on work performance using task breakdown and acknowledging progress\n  - Planning for the upcoming anniversary of the patient's mother's passing\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records to challenge cognitive distortions (patient will continue practicing as homework)\n  - Distress tolerance techniques (deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation) for managing difficult emotions (patient will practice as homework)\n  - Behavioral activation through engaging in activities related to photography or hiking (patient will plan an activity as homework)\n  - Breaking tasks into smaller steps to manage work-related challenges (patient will apply this strategy as needed)\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  1.
