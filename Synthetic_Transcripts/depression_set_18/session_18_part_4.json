  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you taking the time to help me create a comprehensive plan for maintaining my progress and managing setbacks. It's reassuring to know that I have these tools and strategies to rely on, even after our sessions have ended.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mei. I'm confident that you have the skills and resilience to continue making progress and coping with challenges as they arise. Remember, the end of our sessions doesn't mean the end of your journey. It's just the beginning of a new phase where you get to apply all the valuable insights and strategies you've learned.\n\nPatient: That's a nice way to look at it. I feel like I've grown so much through this process, and I'm excited to see how I can continue to apply these skills in my daily life.\n\nTherapist: Speaking of applying these skills, let's discuss your homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought records, focusing on catching and challenging any perfectionistic thoughts related to work or your relationship with Lian. Additionally, I encourage you to share your self-care list with Lian and schedule at least one self-care activity for the upcoming week.\n\nPatient: That sounds doable. I'll make sure to carve out some time for self-care, even if it's just a small activity like taking a relaxing bath or going for a walk in the park.\n\nTherapist: Those are great ideas, Mei. Remember, self-care doesn't have to be time-consuming or elaborate. Even small moments of self-compassion and relaxation can make a big difference in your overall well-being. Before we wrap up, I want to check in on how you're feeling about ending our sessions together. It's normal to have mixed emotions about this transition.\n\nPatient: I do feel a bit nervous about not having our regular check-ins, but I also feel more prepared and confident in my ability to manage my mental health. I know that I have the tools and support I need to continue making progress, and I'm grateful for all the guidance you've provided.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel nervous about this transition, Mei. It's a big step, but I want to reassure you that you've made incredible progress and have developed a strong foundation of skills to support your ongoing well-being. Remember, you can always refer back to your toolbox and wellness action plan whenever you need a little extra guidance.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. Your support and encouragement have meant so much to me throughout this process. I feel like I have a new perspective on my thoughts and behaviors, and I'm excited to continue growing and applying these skills in my daily life.\n\nTherapist: It's been an honor to work with you, Mei, and witness your growth and progress. I have full confidence in your ability to continue thriving and building on the insights you've gained. If you ever find yourself in need of additional support, don't hesitate to reach out. My virtual door is always open.\n\nPatient: That's good to know. Thank you again for everything, Nova. I feel like I'm closing this chapter with a renewed sense of hope and resilience.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Mei. I'm so proud of the work you've done and the progress you've made. Remember, this is just the beginning of your journey. I'm excited to see all the wonderful things you'll accomplish as you continue to apply these skills and prioritize your well-being. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you ever need support in the future.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewing progress and skills learned in therapy\n  - Creating a personalized \"toolbox\" of CBT skills and strategies\n  - Developing a wellness action plan for maintaining progress and managing setbacks\n  - Discussing strategies for coping with challenges after therapy ends\n  - Exploring emotions related to ending therapy and transitioning to independence\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records to challenge perfectionistic thoughts related to work and relationship with Lian\n  - Coping cards with reminders of adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs\n  - Positive Data Log to collect evidence supporting more adaptive beliefs about self\n  - \"I\" statements, boundary-setting, and active listening for improving communication with partner\n  - Downward arrow technique to uncover core beliefs (from previous sessions)\n  - Assertiveness training and boundary-setting strategies for work situations (from previous sessions)\n  - 5-5-5 mindfulness technique for managing mood fluctuations (from previous sessions)\n  - Progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing for relaxation and stress reduction (from previous sessions)\n  - Wind-down alarm and consistent sleep schedule for improving sleep hygiene (from previous sessions)\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  1.
