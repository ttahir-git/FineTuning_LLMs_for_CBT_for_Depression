  "transcript": "Patient: One strategy I thought of was reaching out to my friend from college who also struggles with depression. She's been through therapy before, so she might have some insights to share. I could also try to schedule regular check-ins with myself, like a weekly mental health check-up, to assess how I'm doing and if I need to make any adjustments.\n\nTherapist: Those are both excellent ideas, Mei. Connecting with others who have similar experiences can be a great source of support and encouragement. And scheduling regular check-ins with yourself is a proactive way to monitor your mental health and catch any potential issues early on. Another strategy to consider is creating a list of self-care activities that you can refer to when you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed. This could include things like taking a relaxing bath, going for a walk in nature, or engaging in a creative hobby like photography.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I often forget to prioritize self-care, so having a go-to list could be really helpful. I could even share it with Lian, so they can support me in making time for those activities.\n\nTherapist: That's a great way to involve Lian in your self-care plan. Sharing your list with them can also help them understand what activities are most helpful for you when you're struggling. As we continue to develop your wellness action plan, let's also consider how you can use the CBT skills you've learned to cope with setbacks. For example, if you notice yourself falling into old patterns of perfectionistic thinking, you could pull out a thought record and challenge those thoughts in the moment.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I think I'm getting better at recognizing when I'm having distorted thoughts, so catching them early and challenging them right away could help prevent a downward spiral.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. The sooner you can catch and challenge those thoughts, the less power they'll have over your mood and behavior. Another helpful strategy is to create coping cards with reminders of your new, more adaptive thoughts and beliefs. You can carry these cards with you and pull them out whenever you need a boost of encouragement or a reminder of your progress.\n\nPatient: I've never heard of coping cards before, but I like the idea. It's like having a little pocket therapist with me wherever I go.\n\nTherapist: That's a great way to think about it! Coping cards can be a powerful tool for reinforcing the new thought patterns you've been working on in therapy. You can create cards for different situations, like one for work stress, one for relationship challenges, and one for general self-compassion reminders. The key is to keep them easily accessible, so you can refer to them whenever you need a little extra support.\n\nPatient: I'm definitely going to give that a try. I can already think of a few situations where having a coping card would be really helpful.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Mei. As you continue to practice these skills and strategies, remember that setbacks are a normal part of the process. They don't mean that you've failed or that your progress isn't real. What matters is how you respond to those setbacks and how you use your CBT tools to get back on track.\n\nPatient: That's a good reminder. I think I've been so focused on making progress that I haven't really considered how to handle the inevitable bumps in the road. Knowing that setbacks are normal and having a plan in place to deal with them makes me feel more prepared.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Mei. You've made so much progress in our sessions together, and I have full confidence in your ability to continue using these skills independently. Remember, you have a whole toolbox of strategies at your disposal, and you can always refer back to your thought records, coping cards, and wellness action plan whenever you need a little extra support.",
