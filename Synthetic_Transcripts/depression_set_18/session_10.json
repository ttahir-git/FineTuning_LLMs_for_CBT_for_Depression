Thank you for sharing the summary from our previous session. It's always helpful to review what we've discussed and accomplished so far. Before we dive into today's agenda, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Lastly, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and emotions openly through your words. With that said, how have you been since our last session? How has your mood been, and have you noticed any changes or challenges?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like cognitive restructuring and engaging in enjoyable activities. My mood has been somewhat stable, but I still find myself struggling with feelings of guilt when I take breaks or prioritize self-care. I did manage to take a lunch break at work as part of the behavioral experiment, but I felt anxious the whole time, worrying about falling behind on my tasks.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we've discussed. It's completely normal to experience challenges and mixed emotions as you start to make changes. Let's add your experience with the behavioral experiment to our agenda for today, so we can explore the thoughts and feelings that came up during your lunch break. What else would you like to prioritize for our session today?\n\nPatient: I'd also like to discuss how my cultural background and family beliefs might be influencing my thoughts and behaviors related to self-care. I think it's something we've touched on before, but I feel like it's still a significant barrier for me.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, exploring the impact of your cultural background and family beliefs is an important topic, and I'm glad you brought it up. We can definitely dive deeper into that today. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: I think that covers the main points I wanted to discuss. I'm also open to any suggestions or techniques you think might be helpful based on what we talk about today.\n\nTherapist: That sounds good. So, our agenda for today includes:\n1. Discussing your experience with the behavioral experiment of taking a lunch break at work\n2. Exploring the influence of your cultural background and family beliefs on your thoughts and behaviors related to self-care\n3. Introducing any additional techniques or strategies that may be helpful based on our discussion\n\nBefore we dive in, how are you feeling about our agenda? Is there anything you'd like to add or modify?\n\nTherapist: Let's start by discussing your experience with the behavioral experiment of taking a lunch break at work. Can you walk me through what happened and how you felt during and after the break?\n\nPatient: Sure. I had planned to take a 30-minute lunch break on Wednesday, as we discussed. When the time came, I felt really anxious about stepping away from my desk. I kept thinking about all the work I had to do and how taking a break would just put me further behind. I did manage to take the break, but I spent most of the time worrying and checking my phone for emails.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you followed through with the experiment, even though it was challenging. Let's explore the thoughts and feelings that came up during the break. What was going through your mind when you felt anxious about stepping away from your desk?\n\nPatient: I kept thinking that I was being lazy and that my colleagues would judge me for taking a break. I also worried that I would miss something important or fall behind on my tasks.\n\nTherapist: Those are some really common concerns that many people have when they start prioritizing self-care. Let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. Did anything happen during or after your break that provided evidence for or against the idea that you were being lazy or that your colleagues would judge you?\n\nPatient: Well, when I got back to my desk, nobody said anything about me taking a break. In fact, a couple of my coworkers commented that I seemed more focused and productive in the afternoon. And I realized that I didn't actually miss anything urgent during the 30 minutes I was away.\n\nTherapist: That's really great evidence against the thoughts that you were being lazy or that your colleagues would judge you. It also challenges the belief that taking breaks will lead to falling behind or missing important things. How does this evidence impact your thoughts about taking breaks now?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel a bit more reassured that taking breaks isn't necessarily a bad thing. But I still feel guilty about it, like I'm not working as hard as I should be.\n\nTherapist: I understand that the guilt can be really strong, even when we have evidence that challenges our negative thoughts. This is where practicing self-compassion can be helpful. When you notice those guilty thoughts coming up, try to acknowledge them without judgment and then remind yourself of the evidence you've gathered through this experiment. You might say something like, \"I'm having the thought that I'm not working hard enough, but I know from my experiment that taking breaks can actually improve my focus and productivity.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to practice that self-compassion technique when I notice the guilty thoughts coming up.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's also discuss how your cultural background and family beliefs might be influencing these guilty thoughts and feelings around self-care. Can you tell me a bit more about the messages you received growing up about work and rest?\n\nPatient: Well, my father was in the military, so there was always a strong emphasis on discipline and hard work. He often said things like, \"Rest is for the weak\" and \"Success only comes from tireless effort.\" And in my culture, there's a lot of value placed on putting the needs of the group or family above your own individual needs.\n\nTherapist: Those are really powerful messages that can shape the way we think about work and self-care. It's not surprising that you might feel guilty or selfish when you prioritize your own needs, given those cultural and family beliefs. In CBT, we often talk about \"should statements\" \u2013 thoughts that involve rigid rules about how we or others should behave. It sounds like you might have some \"should statements\" around work and rest, like \"I should always be working\" or \"I should never prioritize my own needs over others'.\" Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that definitely resonates with me. I feel like I have all these \"should\" statements in my head, and they make it really hard to prioritize self-care without feeling guilty.\n\nTherapist: You're not alone in that struggle. Many people have those kinds of \"should statements\" that can fuel feelings of guilt and make it challenging to engage in self-care. Let's explore this further using a technique called the \"downward arrow.\" I'll ask you a series of questions to help us uncover some of the underlying beliefs that might be driving these \"should statements.\" Are you willing to give it a try?\n\nPatient: Sure, that sounds interesting. What kind of questions will you ask?\n\nTherapist: I'll start by asking you to identify a specific \"should statement\" that comes up for you around work and self-care. Then, I'll ask you a series of questions to help us dig deeper and uncover the underlying beliefs. For example, I might ask, \"If that were true, what would that mean to you?\" or \"What's the worst part about that for you?\" We'll keep going until we reach a core belief that feels really central to your experience. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think so. One \"should statement\" that comes up a lot for me is \"I should always be available to my team, even outside of work hours.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's start with that one. What would it mean to you if you weren't always available to your team outside of work hours?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not pulling my weight or being a good team player. Like I'm letting them down.\n\nTherapist: And what's the worst part about letting your team down?\n\nPatient: The worst part is that they might think I'm lazy or selfish. Like I don't care about the project or the company.\n\nTherapist: And if your team thought you were lazy or selfish, what would that mean about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not a good employee... or even a good person. Like I'm not living up to my family's values of hard work and self-sacrifice.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for being so open and vulnerable in sharing that. It sounds like there might be a core belief there around your worth as a person being tied to your productivity and self-sacrifice. We could state that core belief as something like, \"I'm only a good person if I'm always working hard and putting others' needs before my own.\" How does that feel to you?\n\nPatient: It feels really heavy and kind of scary to say out loud, but I think you're right. That belief feels really central to how I see myself and how I approach work and self-care.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight. Now that we've identified this core belief, we can start to examine it more closely and work on reframing it in a more balanced and compassionate way. One way to do that is to look for evidence that contradicts the belief. For example, can you think of a time when you prioritized your own needs and it didn't lead to a negative outcome for your team or your work?\n\nPatient: Well, there was one time a few months ago when I had to leave work early for a doctor's appointment. I felt really guilty about it, but my team was totally understanding and they managed just fine without me for the rest of the day.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of evidence that contradicts the core belief. It shows that prioritizing your own needs doesn't necessarily lead to negative outcomes for your team or your work. As we continue to gather more evidence like this, we can start to build a more balanced and compassionate belief, like \"I can be a good employee and a good person while also taking care of my own needs.\" What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: It feels a little uncomfortable, honestly. Like it goes against everything I've been taught. But I can see how it could be really freeing to believe that.\n\nTherapist: It's totally normal for new beliefs to feel uncomfortable at first, especially when they challenge long-held beliefs that are tied to our family and cultural values. The key is to keep practicing and gathering evidence to support the new belief. One way to do that is to keep a \"positive data log,\" where you write down examples of times when you prioritized self-care and it didn't lead to negative outcomes. Would you be willing to try that as homework between now and our next session?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that could be really helpful. I'll try to write down at least one example every day.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal. Remember, the more evidence we can gather to support the new belief, the easier it will become to challenge those old \"should statements\" and make self-care a more regular part of your routine.\n\nTherapist: You've done a great job today, Mei. We've covered a lot of ground in exploring the influence of your cultural background and family beliefs on your thoughts and behaviors related to self-care. We also practiced using the downward arrow technique to identify a core belief that may be driving some of your \"should statements\" around work and rest. As we wrap up, I'd like to assign some homework to help you continue this work between now and our next session.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. What kind of homework did you have in mind?\n\nTherapist: First, I'd like you to continue practicing the self-compassion technique we discussed earlier, especially when you notice those guilty thoughts coming up around self-care. Try to acknowledge the thoughts without judgment and then remind yourself of the evidence we've gathered that challenges those thoughts.\n\nSecond, I'd like you to keep a \"positive data log\" where you write down examples of times when you prioritized self-care and it didn't lead to negative outcomes. This will help us continue to build evidence to support a more balanced and compassionate belief around work and rest.\n\nFinally, I'd like you to try another behavioral experiment. This time, I'd like you to practice setting a boundary around your work hours. Choose one day this week where you'll commit to stopping work at a specific time, regardless of what's left on your to-do list. Then, notice what happens and write down the evidence for and against your prediction that setting this boundary will lead to negative outcomes.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can try that. It feels a little scary, but I see how it could be helpful.\n\nTherapist: It's totally normal to feel some anxiety around trying something new, especially when it challenges long-held beliefs. Remember, the goal isn't to be perfect at setting boundaries right away, but just to gather more information about what happens when you do.\n\nBefore we end, I want to check in with how you're feeling. What's your mood like now, and do you have any final thoughts about our session today?\n\nPatient: I feel a little overwhelmed, honestly. We covered a lot of heavy stuff today. But I also feel hopeful that I can start to change some of these patterns that have been holding me back.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed after a session like this. We did cover some heavy topics, and change can be really challenging. I'm glad to hear that you're also feeling some hope, though. That's a really important thing to hold onto as we continue this work together.\n\nIf you find yourself feeling overwhelmed between now and our next session, remember that you can always reach out for support. That might mean talking to a friend or family member, or even just writing down your thoughts in a journal. And of course, if you ever feel like you're in crisis, please don't hesitate to reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that reminder. I'll definitely reach out if I need to.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. I'm here to support you, and I believe in your ability to make these changes, even when it feels challenging.\n\nAlright, let's wrap up for today.
