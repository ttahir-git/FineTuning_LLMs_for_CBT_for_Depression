  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of the CBT assessment session transcript:\n\nPatient: In reviewing my mood journal, I noticed that I tend to feel the worst in the mornings, especially on days when I have a lot of meetings at work. I often have thoughts like \"I'm going to fail at this presentation\" or \"Everyone will see how incompetent I am.\" These thoughts make me feel really anxious and down on myself.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing those insights, Mei. The patterns you've noticed in your mood journal are a great starting point for our work together. The thoughts you mentioned, like \"I'm going to fail\" or \"Everyone will see how incompetent I am,\" are examples of what we call cognitive distortions in CBT. \n\nCognitive distortions are inaccurate or exaggerated thought patterns that can contribute to negative emotions. Some common types include all-or-nothing thinking (seeing things in black and white terms), overgeneralization (making broad conclusions based on a single event), and mind reading (assuming we know what others are thinking).\n\nIn your case, it sounds like you might be engaging in some fortune telling (predicting negative outcomes without evidence) and mind reading (assuming your colleagues will think you're incompetent). Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, I can see how those thought patterns might be distorted. But it's hard to shake them in the moment. I get so caught up in the anxiety and self-doubt.\n\nTherapist: That's a very common experience, Mei. These thought patterns can be deeply ingrained and automatic. The good news is that CBT provides tools to help you identify, challenge, and reframe these distortions over time.\n\nOne technique we might use is called \"thought records.\" This involves writing down your negative thoughts, examining the evidence for and against them, and coming up with more balanced or realistic perspectives. For example, if you have the thought \"I'm going to fail at this presentation,\" we might look at past presentations you've given successfully as evidence against that thought.\n\nAnother key aspect of CBT is behavioral activation - gradually engaging in activities that give you a sense of accomplishment or pleasure, even when you don't feel motivated. This can help counteract the lethargy and withdrawal that often come with depression. Based on what you've shared about your interests, this might involve setting small goals related to photography or hiking.\n\nWhat do you think about these ideas? Do you have any questions or concerns?",
