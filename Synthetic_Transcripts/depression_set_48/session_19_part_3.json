  "transcript": "Patient: One of the coping cards I made says, \"Progress over perfection. Every small step counts.\" I've been trying to look at it when I start feeling overwhelmed or discouraged about my business.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic coping card, Em. It's a great reminder that progress is often gradual and that every effort you make counts, even if it doesn't feel like a huge leap forward. How has using this card been helpful for you?\n\nPatient: It's helped me to be a bit kinder to myself and to recognize that I don't have to do everything perfectly. I've been trying to focus on the small wins, like completing a design or getting a positive comment from a customer.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful. Celebrating those small wins is so important. It helps to build momentum and motivation. I'm curious, have you noticed any changes in your behavior or your emotions when you use this coping card?\n\nPatient: I think it's helped me to be a bit more resilient. Like, if I make a mistake or something doesn't turn out how I wanted, I don't spiral into self-criticism as much. I'm able to bounce back a bit faster and keep going.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how our thoughts can influence our emotions and our behaviors. By shifting your thoughts to be more balanced and compassionate, you're able to regulate your emotions more effectively and keep taking action towards your goals, even when things are tough. That's a really important skill.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I'm starting to see how it all connects. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's why we practice. With time and repetition, it will start to feel more natural and automatic. Another helpful tool we can use is the Positive Data Log. This is a place where you can record evidence that supports your new, more adaptive beliefs. For example, you could write down instances where you made progress with your business, or times when you were able to bounce back from a setback. This can help to counteract that negative belief that you're not good enough or that you're wasting your time.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of having a concrete record of my progress and successes, even if they feel small.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And the more you practice looking for and recording that positive evidence, the more you'll start to internalize those new, more helpful beliefs. It's a bit like building a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it gets.\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be helpful. I'll try to start a Positive Data Log this week and see how it goes.\n\nTherapist: That's great. Remember, it doesn't have to be anything huge or groundbreaking. Even small pieces of evidence count. And if you have trouble thinking of things to write down, we can brainstorm together in our next session.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. I feel like I'm starting to build a pretty good toolbox of strategies to help manage my depression and anxiety.\n\nTherapist: You absolutely are, Em. And the fact that you're practicing using these tools, even when it's hard, is a huge testament to your resilience and your commitment to your mental health. I'm really proud of the progress you've made.\n\nPatient: Thank you. It feels good to be making progress, even if it's slow sometimes.",
