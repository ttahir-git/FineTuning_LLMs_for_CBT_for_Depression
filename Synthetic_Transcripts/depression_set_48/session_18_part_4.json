  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some really important insights today, Em. Recognizing the progress you've made, and the skills you've developed, is a big step forward. And being willing to challenge some of those long-held negative beliefs about yourself and your abilities is a huge accomplishment. How are you feeling about all of this?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling pretty good, actually. It's nice to take a step back and see how far I've come. I know I still have work to do, but I feel more hopeful than I have in a long time.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Em. Hope is such an important part of the healing process. And you're right - there's still work to do, but you've got a strong foundation to build on now. What do you think would be most helpful to focus on between now and our next session?\n\nPatient: I think I want to keep working on challenging my negative thoughts, especially the ones about my business and my relationships. And I want to try to be more open with people and ask for help when I need it.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like great goals, Em. Challenging negative thoughts and reaching out for support are both really important skills to keep practicing. What might be some specific steps you could take towards those goals this week?\n\nPatient: I could keep doing thought records, especially when I notice myself getting stuck in negative thoughts about my business. And maybe I could reach out to a friend or family member, just to practice being more open and vulnerable.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like really helpful steps, Em. Doing thought records regularly is a great way to keep building that skill of challenging negative thoughts. And reaching out to someone you trust is a great way to practice being more open and asking for support. Is there anything that might get in the way of taking those steps this week?\n\nPatient: I think the main thing is just my own fears and doubts. Like, I might worry that I'm bothering people if I reach out, or that I'm not doing the thought records \"right.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are really common concerns, Em. It's normal to have some fears and doubts when we're trying something new. What might be a helpful way to respond to those thoughts if they come up?\n\nPatient: I guess I could try to remember that most people are happy to help if they can, and that I'm not expecting myself to be perfect with the thought records. It's okay if I make mistakes or if it feels hard sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great perspective, Em. Remembering that most people want to help, and that it's okay to make mistakes, can be really helpful in managing those fears and doubts. And if you do find yourself getting stuck, you can always reach out to me or someone else you trust for support.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I don't have to do everything on my own.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Em. You've got a lot of people in your corner, and it's okay to lean on us when you need to. Is there anything else you want to make sure we touch on today, before we wrap up?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers everything. I'm feeling pretty good about the plan for this week.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Em. I'm really glad to hear that. Before we end, let's do a quick check-in on how you're feeling now. What's your mood like, and how are you feeling about the work we've done today?\n\nPatient: My mood is pretty good. I'm feeling more hopeful and motivated than I was at the beginning of the session. And I'm feeling good about the work we've done today. It feels like I've made some important progress.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Em. I'm so glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and motivated, and that you're recognizing the progress you've made. Those are really big accomplishments, and I want to acknowledge all the hard work you've put in to get here.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It feels good to hear that. I know I still have work to do, but it's nice to take a moment to appreciate how far I've come.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Em. Celebrating your progress is an important part of the process too. And I have no doubt that you'll keep making progress, as long as you keep showing up and doing the work like you have been. Is there anything else you need from me today, before we wrap up?\n\nPatient: No, I think I'm good. Thank you for all your help and support, Nova. It really means a lot to me.\n\nTherapist: It's my pleasure, Em. I'm really glad I can be here to support you. Remember, you can always reach out if you need anything between now and our next session. Take care of yourself this week, and I'll talk to you soon.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I'll do my best.
