  "transcript": "Patient: So, the disagreement with my friend started when they made a comment about my business, saying that I'm not really doing enough to make it succeed. It just hit a nerve, you know? I started thinking that maybe they're right, and I'm just not cut out for this.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why that comment would be upsetting, especially given the negative core beliefs we've been working on challenging. Let's explore this further using a thought record. Can you walk me through the situation and the thoughts and emotions that came up for you?\n\nPatient: Sure. It was last Saturday, and we were having lunch together. Out of nowhere, they just said, \"You know, Em, I think you could be doing more with your business. It just doesn't seem like you're really trying.\" I immediately felt angry and defensive, but also kind of hopeless, like maybe they're right.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's break this down. The situation was your friend making a comment about your business. The emotions you identified were anger, defensiveness, and hopelessness. On a scale of 0-100, how intense were those emotions?\n\nPatient: The anger was probably around 80, defensiveness around 75, and hopelessness around 60.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's identify the automatic thought that came up in response to your friend's comment. What was going through your mind in that moment?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"They're right. I'm not doing enough. I'm just not cut out for this.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great catch. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not doing enough or not cut out for this?\n\nPatient: Well, my business isn't as successful as I'd like it to be. I'm not making a lot of money, and I sometimes struggle to stay motivated.\n\nTherapist: Okay, and what evidence do you have against that thought? What are some ways in which you are doing enough or are cut out for this?\n\nPatient: I guess I have been putting in a lot of effort, even if it doesn't always feel like it. I've been trying to learn new skills and promote my business. And I have had some successes, even if they're small.\n\nTherapist: That's great. Now, let's look at that evidence and see if we can come up with an alternative thought. Based on the evidence for and against your original thought, what might be a more balanced way of looking at the situation?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I am putting in effort, even if I'm not where I want to be yet. Success takes time, and I'm learning and growing along the way.\"\n\nTherapist: I think that's a fantastic alternative thought. It acknowledges the effort you're putting in and the reality that success is a process. Now, with that alternative thought in mind, how intense are those emotions of anger, defensiveness, and hopelessness?\n\nPatient: The anger is probably down to around 50, defensiveness around 40, and hopelessness around 30.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift. How does it feel to have gone through that process?\n\nPatient: It feels good. I can see how my initial thought wasn't really based on all the evidence, and how looking at it differently can change how I feel.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. This is something we can continue to practice, both in our sessions and in your daily life. The more you can catch those automatic thoughts and challenge them with evidence, the more you'll start to see shifts in your emotions and overall mood.",
