  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Em, it's great to see you again for our 10th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me so far. Since our last session, I've been trying to keep up with the homework you assigned, but it's been a bit challenging. I've managed to complete some thought records and practice the opposite action, but I'm still struggling to find evidence against my negative core beliefs using the positive data log.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Em. It's common to face challenges when working on changing long-held beliefs. Let's explore this further today. How about we start by setting an agenda for our session? We can review your homework, discuss the difficulties you've encountered with the positive data log, and work on reframing your core beliefs. We can also introduce a new coping skill if you feel it would be helpful. What are your thoughts on this plan?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me, Nova. I think it would be helpful to discuss the challenges I've been facing with the positive data log and to work on reframing my core beliefs. I'm open to learning a new coping skill as well.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your homework. Can you share some of the thought records you've completed since our last session?",
