  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that stood out was when I tried to reach out to a friend from my military days. I sent them a message, but they didn't respond for several days. I started feeling really down and anxious, thinking that they didn't want to talk to me anymore.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Em. Let's break down this situation using the CBT framework. The situation was reaching out to your friend and not receiving a response. The emotions you experienced were feeling down and anxious. What thoughts were going through your mind when you felt this way?\n\nPatient: I thought that my friend didn't care about me anymore, and that I wasn't important to them. I also started thinking that I'm not good at maintaining friendships and that people always end up leaving me.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your openness in sharing those thoughts, Em. In CBT, we call these types of thoughts \"cognitive distortions.\" Cognitive distortions are inaccurate or exaggerated thought patterns that can contribute to negative emotions. One common distortion is \"jumping to conclusions,\" which seems to be present in your thoughts about your friend not caring about you and people always leaving you. Can you see how these thoughts might be jumping to conclusions without enough evidence?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess I don't really know why my friend didn't respond. It could be for reasons that have nothing to do with me.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Another distortion present in your thoughts is \"all-or-nothing thinking,\" which is when we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms. The thought that you're not good at maintaining friendships is an example of this. It's likely that there are some friendships you've maintained well, and others that have been more challenging. Does this resonate with you?\n\nPatient: It does. I have a few close friends, but I tend to focus on the friendships that haven't worked out.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Em. Recognizing these cognitive distortions is an important step in CBT. The next step is to challenge these thoughts and develop more balanced, realistic ways of thinking. For example, instead of thinking \"my friend doesn't care about me,\" a more balanced thought might be \"there could be many reasons why my friend hasn't responded yet, and it may have nothing to do with our friendship.\" How does that sound to you?",
