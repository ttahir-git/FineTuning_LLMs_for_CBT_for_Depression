  "transcript": "Patient: It feels good to break down the situation like that and see how my thoughts were affecting my emotions. I guess I didn't realize how much that one comment from my friend was triggering those deeper beliefs about myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Em. Our thoughts and beliefs can have a powerful impact on our emotions and behaviors, often without us even realizing it. By using tools like thought records, we can start to uncover those connections and challenge the thoughts that aren't serving us.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I'm starting to see that. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment, you know? When I'm feeling really emotional, it's like all those rational thoughts go out the window.\n\nTherapist: That's a totally normal experience, and it's something that takes practice. One thing that can be helpful is to try to notice the early signs that you're starting to feel emotional, before it gets too intense. What are some of the physical sensations or thoughts that come up for you when you're starting to feel angry or hopeless?\n\nPatient: Let's see... I guess I start to feel kind of tense, like my shoulders are tightening up. And my thoughts start to get really negative, like \"I'm never going to be good enough\" or \"Nobody really cares about me.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are great things to notice. So, when you start to feel that tension in your shoulders or notice those negative thoughts creeping in, that can be a cue to pause and pull out your thought record or coping card. It's kind of like hitting the pause button on those automatic thoughts and giving yourself a chance to look at the situation more objectively.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of having a specific cue to remind me to use the tools we've been working on.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And the more you practice, the more automatic it will become. It's kind of like building a new habit.\n\nPatient: I guess it's like when I first started doing yoga. At first, it felt really unnatural and I had to think about every movement. But now, it's like my body just knows what to do.\n\nTherapist: That's a perfect analogy! It's the same thing with these cognitive skills. At first, it feels a bit awkward and you have to really think about it. But over time, it becomes more natural and you can do it without even thinking about it.\n\nPatient: That's encouraging to know. I guess I just have to keep practicing, even when it feels hard.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And remember, it's okay if you don't always get it right. The important thing is that you keep trying and keep coming back to these skills, even when it's challenging.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I'm definitely going to keep working on this. It's nice to know that I have these tools to fall back on when things get tough.",
