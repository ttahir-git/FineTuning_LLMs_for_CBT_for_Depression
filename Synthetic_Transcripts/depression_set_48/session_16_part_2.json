  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can give you an example. A few days ago, I was feeling really low and decided to try going for a walk to boost my mood. But as soon as I stepped outside, I started thinking, \"This is pointless. Walking isn't going to solve my problems or make me feel better. I'm just going to feel worse when I get back.\" I ended up turning around and going back inside, feeling even more discouraged than before.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Em. It highlights how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing our emotions and behaviors. Let's break down this situation using a thought record to help us understand what happened and find ways to challenge those negative thoughts.\n\nFirst, can you tell me what emotions you were feeling in that moment, and how intense they were on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I was feeling hopeless, probably around 80 out of 100. I also felt frustrated with myself, maybe around 70.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you were experiencing some pretty intense emotions. Now, let's identify the automatic thoughts that were going through your mind. You mentioned thinking, \"This is pointless. Walking isn't going to solve my problems or make me feel better. I'm just going to feel worse when I get back.\" Were there any other thoughts?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I also thought, \"I'm never going to get better. I've tried so many things, and nothing seems to work.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound really discouraging and defeating. Let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts, starting with the idea that walking is pointless and won't make you feel better. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've tried going for walks before, and sometimes I don't feel any better afterward. It's not a guaranteed mood-booster.\n\nTherapist: That's a fair point. Now, what about evidence against this thought? Have there been times when going for a walk did help improve your mood, even a little bit?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been times when I felt a bit better after a walk, especially if I focused on my surroundings and tried to stay present. And even if it didn't drastically improve my mood, it didn't usually make me feel worse.\n\nTherapist: So, while walking isn't a guaranteed mood-booster, there is evidence that it can sometimes help, even if just a little bit. Now, let's look at the thought, \"I'm never going to get better. I've tried so many things, and nothing seems to work.\" What evidence do you have for this thought?\n\nPatient: It just feels like I've been struggling with depression for so long, and I've tried therapy and medication before, but I still have bad days. It's hard to see a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nTherapist: I understand how that can feel really discouraging. What about evidence against this thought? Have you made any progress or had any successes, even small ones, in managing your depression?\n\nPatient: Well, I have been making progress in therapy lately, and I've learned some new coping skills that seem to help a bit. And even though I still have bad days, they don't seem to be as frequent or as intense as they used to be.\n\nTherapist: That's really significant, Em. It shows that you are making progress, even if it feels slow or small at times. Recovery from depression is often a gradual process, with ups and downs along the way. The fact that you're noticing some improvements and learning new skills is a sign that things can and do get better.\n\nNow, let's try to reframe these thoughts in a more balanced and helpful way. Instead of \"This is pointless. Walking isn't going to solve my problems or make me feel better,\" what could be a more adaptive thought?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"Going for a walk might not solve all my problems, but it could help improve my mood a bit, and it's a healthy coping strategy to try.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe! It acknowledges that walking isn't a cure-all but recognizes its potential benefits. And instead of \"I'm never going to get better,\" what could be a more helpful thought?\n\nPatient: I could try thinking, \"Recovery is a process, and I'm making progress, even if it's slow. I've had successes and learned new skills that are helping me manage my depression better.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent! That thought acknowledges the challenges of recovery while focusing on the progress you've made and the skills you've gained. Now, let's re-rate your emotions based on these new thoughts. How intense does that feeling of hopelessness feel now, on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: It's definitely less intense, maybe around 50 now.\n\nTherapist: And what about the frustration with yourself?\n\nPatient: That's gone down too, probably to around 40.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant decrease in intensity for both emotions. This shows how challenging negative thoughts can help shift our emotional state and make it easier to engage in healthy behaviors, like going for a walk.\n\nAs we continue with therapy, we'll keep practicing this process of identifying, challenging, and reframing negative thoughts. It takes time and practice, but it can make a big difference in managing depression.\n\nI'd like to give you a homework assignment to help you practice this skill. Over the next week, I'd like you to fill out a thought record whenever you notice yourself feeling discouraged or hopeless about engaging in mood-boosting activities. Try to identify the automatic thoughts, look at the evidence for and against them, and come up with a more balanced and helpful reframe. We can review your thought records together in our next session.\n\nHow does that sound to you? Do you have any questions or concerns about this homework assignment?",
