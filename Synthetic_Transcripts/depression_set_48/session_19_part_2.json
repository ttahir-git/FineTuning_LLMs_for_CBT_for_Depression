  "transcript": "Patient: Filling out the thought records has been helpful, but it's also been challenging at times. I find it easier to do when I'm in a more stable mood, but when I'm really down or anxious, it's harder to think clearly and challenge my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Em. It's common for people to find thought records more difficult when they're feeling very distressed. The key is to practice the skill even when it feels hard, as that's when we often need it the most. Let's look at one of the thought records you completed this week. Can you share an example of a situation where you noticed negative thoughts related to your online business?\n\nPatient: Sure. Earlier this week, I was working on a new product design, and I started feeling really discouraged. I had thoughts like, \"This isn't good enough,\" \"No one will want to buy this,\" and \"I'm wasting my time trying to make this business work.\"\n\nTherapist: Those sound like some pretty harsh self-criticisms. Let's walk through the thought record together. What emotions were you feeling in that moment, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I was feeling really down and hopeless, maybe around an 80. I also felt anxious, probably around a 70.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you were experiencing some intense emotions. What did you put in the \"Evidence That Supports This Thought\" column for the thought \"This isn't good enough\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I was comparing my design to other successful products I've seen online, and mine didn't seem as polished or professional. I also thought about times in the past when I've put a lot of effort into something, and it didn't turn out well.\n\nTherapist: And what about the \"Evidence That Does Not Support This Thought\" column?\n\nPatient: I tried to remind myself that everyone has to start somewhere, and it's okay if my designs aren't perfect right away. I also thought about some of the positive feedback I've gotten from friends and customers who have liked my work in the past.\n\nTherapist: Great job looking for evidence on both sides. What was the alternative thought you came up with?\n\nPatient: I wrote, \"It's okay if my design isn't perfect. I'm still learning and improving, and I've gotten positive feedback before. I don't have to compare myself to others.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and compassionate thought. How did your emotions change after going through this process?\n\nPatient: I still felt a bit discouraged, but the intensity went down to maybe a 50 for feeling down and a 40 for anxiety. It helped to put things in perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful progress, Em. Even a small reduction in the intensity of your emotions can make a big difference in how you feel and how you approach the situation. Remember, the goal isn't to get rid of negative emotions completely, but to find ways to manage them so they don't overwhelm you or keep you from doing things that are important to you.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's just hard to remember that in the moment sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's why we practice. With time and repetition, it will start to feel more natural and automatic. Let's also talk about the coping cards you created. Can you share one of the cards you made and how you've been using it?",
