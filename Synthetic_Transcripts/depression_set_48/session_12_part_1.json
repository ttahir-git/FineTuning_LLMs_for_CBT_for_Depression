  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Em, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been since our last session? How has your mood been, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the transparency, Nova. I appreciate you letting me know your limitations upfront. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to use the coping card and thought records when I notice negative thoughts creeping in. It's not always easy, but I'm making an effort. My mood has been a bit up and down \u2013 some days are better than others. I did have a bit of a setback over the weekend when I got into a disagreement with a friend, and it stirred up some of those old feelings of being unworthy and unlovable.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you've been making an effort with the coping card and thought records, even though it's not always easy. It's normal to have ups and downs, and setbacks are a part of the process. I'm sorry to hear about the disagreement with your friend and how it brought up those difficult feelings. Would you like to talk more about that today and perhaps explore how we can use some of the tools we've been working on to help you navigate those situations?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that would be helpful. I want to understand why I react so strongly to conflicts and how I can manage those feelings better. I also want to keep working on challenging my negative core beliefs and building up my self-esteem.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. Let's add those topics to our agenda for today. We can start by discussing the disagreement with your friend and the emotions it brought up, then explore how we can apply the coping card, thought records, and other tools to help you manage those situations. We'll also continue working on challenging your negative core beliefs and building self-esteem. Does that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it. I'm ready to dive in.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's start with the disagreement you had with your friend. Can you tell me more about what happened and what thoughts and emotions came up for you during and after the conflict?",
