  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by looking at the thought records you completed over the past week. Can you share an example of a situation that triggered a strong emotion and the automatic thoughts that came up for you?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I was supposed to meet up with a friend for coffee, but they canceled at the last minute. I felt really disappointed and hurt. My automatic thought was, \"They don't really care about me. No one wants to spend time with me.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Em. I can understand why that situation would bring up feelings of disappointment and hurt. Let's explore this further. What evidence did you find that supports or refutes this automatic thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the evidence that supports it is that they canceled our plans. But when I thought about it more, I realized that this friend has been there for me in the past. They've helped me through some tough times, so it might not be fair to say they don't care about me.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Em. You've identified evidence that both supports and refutes the automatic thought. It's important to consider the bigger picture and not just focus on one instance. Recognizing your friend's past support is a strong piece of evidence against the thought that they don't care about you. Now, let's look at alternative thoughts you could have in this situation.\n\nPatient: I suppose an alternative thought could be, \"My friend might have had a valid reason for canceling. It doesn't necessarily mean they don't care about me.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent! That's a much more balanced and realistic thought. It takes into account that there could be reasons beyond your control for your friend's cancellation. How did your emotion change after coming up with this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I still felt a bit disappointed, but I didn't feel as hurt or rejected as before. I guess I was able to see the situation from a different perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Em. By challenging the automatic thought and coming up with a more balanced alternative, you were able to shift your emotional response. This is a great example of how our thoughts can influence our feelings. Remember, just because we think something doesn't necessarily make it true. It's essential to examine the evidence and consider alternative perspectives.\n\nPatient: You're right. It's just hard to do that in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed by my emotions.\n\nTherapist: I completely understand. It takes practice to be able to challenge automatic thoughts in the moment. That's why we start by doing it retrospectively, like you did with your thought record. As you continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to apply it in real-time situations. Let's look at another example from your thought records and practice challenging the automatic thought together.",
