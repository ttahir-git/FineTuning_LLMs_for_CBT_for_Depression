  "transcript": "Patient: The homework assignment sounds good. I'll do my best to fill out the thought records when I notice those discouraging thoughts coming up. I don't have any questions about it right now, but I'll let you know if something comes up as I'm working on it.\n\nTherapist: Great, I'm glad you feel comfortable with the homework assignment. Remember, it's okay if you don't catch every negative thought or if the reframing feels challenging at first. The more you practice, the easier it will become.\n\nI want to shift gears a bit and explore how your thoughts and beliefs might be impacting your behavior, particularly when it comes to social interactions and relationships. In our previous sessions, you've mentioned struggling with feelings of worthlessness and the belief that you're not worthy of people's time or attention. How do you think these beliefs affect your behavior in social situations?\n\nPatient: I think these beliefs make me really hesitant to reach out to people or engage in social activities. I often assume that people don't want to spend time with me or that I'll just bring them down. So, I tend to isolate myself and avoid social interactions, even though I know that connecting with others could help improve my mood.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Em. Our thoughts and beliefs can have a powerful impact on our behavior, and in turn, our behavior can reinforce those thoughts and beliefs. It's a cycle that can be tough to break, but it's not impossible.\n\nLet's look at a specific example of a social situation where you noticed these beliefs affecting your behavior. Can you think of a recent time when you wanted to reach out to someone or engage in a social activity but didn't because of these negative beliefs?\n\nPatient: Yeah, last weekend, a friend from my yoga class invited me to join a group of them for lunch after class. I wanted to go, but I started thinking, \"They probably just invited me to be nice. They don't really want me there. I'll just be awkward and bring everyone down.\" So, I made up an excuse and went home instead.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. Let's break down what happened using the CBT triangle, which shows how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected.\n\nThe situation was the invitation to lunch with your yoga friends. The thoughts you identified were, \"They probably just invited me to be nice. They don't really want me there. I'll just be awkward and bring everyone down.\" What emotions did you feel in that moment?\n\nPatient: I felt anxious, maybe around 70 out of 100, and sad, probably around 60.\n\nTherapist: And the behavior was that you made up an excuse and went home instead of joining them for lunch, right?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\n\nTherapist: So, in this situation, the negative thoughts led to feelings of anxiety and sadness, which then led to the behavior of avoiding the social interaction. And by avoiding the interaction, you didn't get the chance to test out whether your negative thoughts were actually true, which might reinforce those beliefs in the future.\n\nOne way to break this cycle is to challenge those negative thoughts and beliefs and try behaving in a way that aligns with more balanced and helpful thoughts. This is where behavioral experiments can be really useful.\n\nA behavioral experiment is a way to test out our beliefs and predictions in real-life situations. It involves identifying a specific belief or prediction, designing an experiment to test it, and then evaluating the outcome to see if the belief is accurate.\n\nIn this case, the belief you could test is, \"People don't really want me around, and I'll just bring them down.\" The experiment could involve accepting an invitation to a social activity and observing what happens. The goal would be to gather evidence that challenges the negative belief.\n\nHow do you feel about trying a behavioral experiment related to this belief?\n\nPatient: It makes sense, but it also feels really scary. The idea of putting myself out there and risking rejection or awkwardness is really uncomfortable.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel scared and uncomfortable about challenging these beliefs. That discomfort is a sign that we're targeting something really important, something that's been holding you back.\n\nWe can start small and gradually work up to more challenging experiments. For example, you could start by accepting an invitation to a one-on-one interaction with someone you feel relatively comfortable with, rather than jumping into a group setting right away.\n\nThe key is to approach these experiments with a curious and open mindset, rather than trying to prove yourself right or wrong. The goal is to gather evidence and learn from the experience, not to judge yourself.\n\nWhat do you think about starting with a smaller experiment, like accepting an invitation to a one-on-one interaction? Is there someone you feel comfortable enough with to try that?\n\nPatient: I think I could try that. There's a friend from my yoga class who I feel relatively comfortable with. She's invited me to get coffee a few times, and I've always said no. Maybe I could try saying yes next time.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great place to start! Before we move forward with planning the experiment, let's identify what thoughts and predictions might come up for you in that situation. What do you imagine you might think or expect if you say yes to your friend's invitation?\n\nPatient: I might think, \"She's just inviting me to be nice. She doesn't really want to spend time with me.\" And I might expect the conversation to be awkward or for her to seem disinterested in what I have to say.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so those are the thoughts and predictions we'll be testing with this experiment. Now, let's plan out what you'll do. When your friend invites you to get coffee, you'll say yes and observe what happens during the interaction. Afterward, you'll reflect on whether the evidence supports your negative beliefs or challenges them.\n\nTo make this experiment more objective, it can be helpful to identify some specific, observable behaviors to look for. For example, you could pay attention to whether your friend seems engaged in the conversation, asks you questions, or shares things about herself. These behaviors could be evidence that she does want to spend time with you and values your company.\n\nHow does that sound? Do you feel comfortable with this plan for the experiment?",
