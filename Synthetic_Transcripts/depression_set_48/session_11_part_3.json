  "transcript": "Therapist: Now that we've added this situation to your Positive Data Log, let's explore how we can use this evidence to challenge your negative core belief in the moment, when you're feeling down or rejected. One technique that can be helpful is to create a coping card with your new core belief and some of the strongest evidence for it. This can be a physical card that you keep with you, or a note on your phone, so you can easily access it when you need a reminder. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It would be helpful to have something tangible to look at when I'm struggling with those negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's create a coping card together now. We can start with your new core belief at the top: \"I am worthy of love and connection, even if I'm not perfect.\" Then, we can add a few pieces of evidence from your Positive Data Log that really resonate with you. What are some of the most powerful examples that challenge your negative core belief?\n\nPatient: Well, I think the situation with my friend is a good one. It shows that even if I'm feeling insecure, I'm still reaching out and trying to connect. And the fact that my friend has been there for me in the past is important evidence too.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples! Let's add those to your coping card. We can also include some of the other evidence we've discussed in previous sessions, like the ways you've shown resilience and strength in facing challenges, or the positive feedback you've received from others about your kindness and creativity. What other evidence feels really meaningful to you?\n\nPatient: I think the fact that I've been able to build a life for myself, even with all the challenges I've faced, is really significant. It shows that I have inner strength and resourcefulness, even when I don't feel that way.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! That's a really powerful piece of evidence. Let's add that to your coping card as well. Now, whenever you're feeling down or doubting your worthiness, you can pull out this card and remind yourself of all the evidence that challenges those negative thoughts. How does it feel to have this tool?\n\nPatient: It feels really empowering, actually. I like the idea of having something concrete to turn to when I'm struggling. It makes it feel more real, somehow.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Em. I'm so glad this feels like a helpful tool for you. Remember, the more you practice using your coping card and focusing on the evidence for your new core belief, the more natural it will start to feel over time. It's like building a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it gets.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'm definitely going to keep practicing with this.\n\nTherapist: That's great! As you continue to use your coping card and add to your Positive Data Log, you'll likely start to notice a shift in your overall thinking patterns. It's not always a linear process - there will be ups and downs - but over time, you'll likely find that your new core belief starts to feel more automatic and natural.",
