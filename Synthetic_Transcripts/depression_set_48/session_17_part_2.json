  "transcript": "Patient: Running my online business has been more challenging lately. I struggle to find the motivation to work on new designs and promote my products. I often feel overwhelmed and end up procrastinating or avoiding tasks altogether.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like your depression might be impacting your motivation and ability to focus on your business. Let's explore this further. When you think about working on your business, what thoughts come to mind?\n\nPatient: I often think, \"I'm not good enough,\" or \"No one will want to buy my products.\" I also worry that I'm not productive enough and that I'm falling behind.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound familiar, don't they? They're similar to the negative beliefs we've been working on challenging in our sessions. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle. The situation here is working on your online business. The thoughts you mentioned are, \"I'm not good enough,\" \"No one will want to buy my products,\" and \"I'm not productive enough.\" What emotions do you experience when you have these thoughts?\n\nPatient: I feel discouraged, anxious, and sometimes hopeless. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of negative thoughts and feelings, and it's hard to break out of it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Em. The emotions you mentioned \u2013 discouragement, anxiety, and hopelessness \u2013 are likely being fueled by those negative thoughts. And when we feel that way, it's natural to want to avoid or procrastinate, which is the behavior part of the CBT triangle. Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, it does. I can see how my thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all connected. But it's still hard to break out of that cycle.\n\nTherapist: I understand, and that's where we can use some of the skills we've been working on to help you challenge those negative thoughts and develop more balanced, helpful thoughts. Let's start by examining the evidence for and against the thought, \"I'm not good enough.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I compare myself to other successful online businesses, and I feel like I don't measure up. I also haven't been as productive lately, which makes me feel like I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you've identified some evidence that seems to support the thought. Now, let's look for evidence against the thought, \"I'm not good enough.\" What would you say to that?\n\nPatient: Hmm, well, I have had some successful sales and positive feedback from customers. And even though I'm struggling with productivity, I am still managing to create new designs and keep my business running.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought, \"I'm not good enough.\" You've had successful sales, positive feedback, and you're still creating and managing your business despite the challenges. Let's look at the other negative thought, \"No one will want to buy my products.\" What evidence do you have for and against this thought?\n\nPatient: For the thought, I guess I worry that my products aren't unique or appealing enough. But against the thought, I have made sales, and I've had repeat customers who seem to really like my work.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! You've identified evidence that directly contradicts the negative thought. This is a great opportunity to develop a more balanced thought, such as, \"While I may have doubts sometimes, I have evidence that people do enjoy and purchase my products.\" How does that sound?\n\nPatient: It sounds more realistic and helpful than the negative thought. I can see how challenging these thoughts can help me feel more motivated and confident in my business.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! As we continue to practice these skills, it will become easier to catch and challenge negative thoughts, which can help improve your mood and motivation. Another strategy we can use is behavioral activation. This involves setting small, achievable goals related to your business and breaking tasks down into manageable steps. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of setting small goals. It feels less overwhelming than trying to tackle everything at once.\n\nTherapist: That's the idea! By setting small, achievable goals, you can build momentum and start to feel more accomplished and motivated. Let's think of a small goal related to your business that you can work on this week. What comes to mind?\n\nPatient: I could aim to create one new design and post about it on social media. That feels doable and would help me feel like I'm making progress.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Em! Creating one new design and promoting it on social media is a concrete, achievable task that can help you build momentum and challenge the negative thoughts we discussed. As you work on this goal, pay attention to your thoughts and feelings, and use the skills we've practiced to challenge any negative thoughts that arise.",
