I don't have any questions about it.\n\nTherapist: Great, I'm glad you feel comfortable with the homework. Before we wrap up, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now, and do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also hopeful. It's been a heavy session, but I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better. I appreciate you helping me work through these challenges.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel tired after a session like this. We've done some important work today, and I'm glad you're feeling hopeful. Remember to take care of yourself and practice self-compassion as you continue this journey.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I'll do my best.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Em. I have faith in your ability to grow and heal.

Continue using thought records to challenge negative thoughts, especially when you notice early signs of emotion.\n2.

Design another behavioral experiment to test one of your negative beliefs.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns between now and our next session, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I'll do my best to complete the homework and reach out if I need help.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful.
