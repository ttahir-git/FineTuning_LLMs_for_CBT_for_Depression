  "transcript": "Patient: That feels a lot more hopeful and motivating. I like the idea of focusing on the small steps and the progress I'm making, instead of just the end goal.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Em. Focusing on the process and the small steps can be really helpful in maintaining motivation and a sense of progress. And it's okay if some days are harder than others - that's all part of the learning process.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I'm starting to see that. It's just hard to remember in the moment sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's totally understandable, Em. It takes practice to shift our thinking patterns, especially when we're feeling down or discouraged. One thing that can be helpful is to create some coping cards or reminders for yourself, with more balanced and helpful thoughts like the ones we just discussed. That way, when you're having a tough moment, you can pull out the cards and remind yourself of a different perspective.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I could keep them in my wallet or tape them to my computer monitor, so I see them regularly.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Em. And as you practice using those more balanced thoughts, they'll start to feel more natural and automatic. It's like building a new mental habit.\n\nPatient: I'm definitely ready to start building some new mental habits. The old ones aren't serving me very well.\n\nTherapist: I'm really glad to hear that, Em. And I want to acknowledge the progress you've already made in starting to shift those habits. Learning to recognize and challenge negative thoughts is a big accomplishment, and you've been doing great work with that.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. It feels good to hear that. I don't always give myself credit for the progress I've made.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Em. Learning to acknowledge and celebrate our own progress is an important part of the process too. What do you think about taking a few minutes now to reflect on some of the progress you've made in our work together, and how you're feeling about it?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I know I've made a lot of progress with recognizing my negative thoughts and challenging them. And I'm starting to feel a bit more hopeful about my business and my future in general.\n\nTherapist: Those are really significant changes, Em. Recognizing and challenging negative thoughts is a core skill in CBT, and it's something you'll be able to use for the rest of your life, in all kinds of situations. And feeling more hopeful about the future is a big shift too. What do you think has been the most helpful part of our work together so far, in terms of supporting those changes?\n\nPatient: I think the most helpful part has been learning to question my thoughts and look at them more objectively. Like with the thought records we've been doing - it's helped me see that a lot of my negative thoughts aren't actually based on facts.\n\nTherapist: That's a really key insight, Em. Learning to question our thoughts and look at them more objectively is a core part of CBT. And you're right - often when we really examine our negative thoughts, we find that they're not based on facts or evidence. They're more like habits or assumptions that we've developed over time.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I'm starting to see that. It's like I've been telling myself these negative stories for so long, I started to believe they were true.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common experience, Em. Our thoughts can be very convincing, even when they're not based on facts. That's why it's so important to learn to question them and look for evidence, like we've been practicing.\n\nPatient: It's definitely a skill I want to keep working on. I know I still have a lot of negative thoughts that I need to challenge.\n\nTherapist: And that's okay, Em. Learning to challenge negative thoughts is a process, and it takes ongoing practice. The good news is, the more you practice, the easier it gets. And you've already made a great start.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I'm feeling more motivated to keep working on it. I know it's not going to be easy, but it's worth it to feel better.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Em. And I want to remind you that you don't have to do it all on your own. You've got support - from me, from your friends and family, and from the skills and tools you've been learning. You're not alone in this.\n\nPatient: That means a lot to hear that. I've always felt like I had to do everything on my own, but I'm starting to see that it's okay to lean on other people sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Leaning on other people is a sign of strength, not weakness, Em. It takes courage to be vulnerable and ask for help. And it can make a big difference in terms of feeling supported and less alone.\n\nPatient: I'm definitely working on being more open with people and asking for help when I need it. It's still scary sometimes, but I'm trying.\n\nTherapist: That's all you can do, Em - keep trying, and be patient and compassionate with yourself in the process. Learning new skills and habits takes time and practice, and there will be ups and downs along the way. But as long as you keep showing up and doing the work, you'll keep making progress.",
