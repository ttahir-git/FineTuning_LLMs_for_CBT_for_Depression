  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Em, it's great to see you again for our second session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm feeling a bit low today, but I'm trying to stay positive and hopeful about this therapy process.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your openness, Em. It's normal to have ups and downs, and I'm here to support you through them. Before we continue, let's set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review your homework from the previous session, discuss the CBT framework focusing on the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and start exploring your specific thought patterns related to your depression. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm curious to learn more about how my thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are connected.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your homework. Were you able to keep a thought record over the past week, noting situations, emotions, and thoughts associated with strong negative emotions?\n\nPatient: Yes, I did my best to keep track of my thoughts and emotions. It was challenging at times, but I managed to write down a few situations that triggered strong negative feelings.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful that you were able to complete the homework, Em. It can be challenging to start a new practice like this, but it's a crucial step in understanding your thought patterns. Would you feel comfortable sharing one of the situations you recorded?",
