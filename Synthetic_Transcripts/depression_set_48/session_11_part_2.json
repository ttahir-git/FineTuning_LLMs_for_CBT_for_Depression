  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by exploring the situation with your friend in more detail. Can you walk me through what happened and what thoughts and emotions came up for you?\n\nPatient: Sure. I texted my friend to see if they wanted to grab coffee sometime soon. I didn't hear back from them for a few days, and I started to feel really anxious and down about it. I kept thinking that they didn't want to hang out with me, that I'm not important to them, and that I'm not worthy of their time and attention.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Em. I can hear how painful that experience was for you. Let's break this down a bit. What emotions did you notice coming up when you didn't hear back from your friend?\n\nPatient: I felt really anxious at first, like a knot in my stomach. And then I started to feel sad and hopeless, like I always end up getting rejected or abandoned by people I care about.\n\nTherapist: That's a really difficult emotional experience. I'm wondering if we can identify the thoughts that were connected to those emotions. What was going through your mind when you felt that anxiety and sadness?\n\nPatient: I kept thinking that my friend doesn't really care about me, that I'm not a priority to them. And then I started to think that there must be something wrong with me, that I'm just not lovable or worthy of people's time and attention.\n\nTherapist: I hear how those thoughts are connected to your core belief that you're fundamentally unlovable or flawed. Let's look at this situation through the lens of the thought record. What evidence do you have that supports the thought that your friend doesn't care about you?\n\nPatient: Well, they didn't respond to my text for several days. That feels like a pretty clear sign that I'm not important to them.\n\nTherapist: I understand how that could feel like evidence for your thought. Let's see if we can find any other perspectives or evidence that might challenge that thought. What are some other reasons why your friend might not have responded right away?\n\nPatient: I guess they could have been busy with work or other commitments. Or maybe they didn't see the text or forgot to respond.\n\nTherapist: Those are great alternative explanations. Let's look at the evidence for those possibilities. Has your friend ever been slow to respond before, but then followed up later?\n\nPatient: Yeah, actually. They've done that before. They have a pretty demanding job, so sometimes they get caught up in work and don't check their phone for a while.\n\nTherapist: That's really important evidence to consider. It sounds like there are other factors that could explain their delayed response, besides them not caring about you. Let's look at the bigger picture of your friendship. Can you think of any evidence that challenges the thought that you're not important to them?\n\nPatient: Well, they did reach out to me a few weeks ago to see how I was doing. And they've been there for me during some tough times in the past. I guess those are signs that they do care about our friendship.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Those are really significant pieces of evidence that challenge the thought that you're not important to them. It's so important to consider the full context of your relationship, rather than just focusing on this one situation. How is this shifting your perspective on the situation with your friend?\n\nPatient: It's helping me see that there could be other reasons why they didn't respond right away, and that it doesn't necessarily mean they don't care about me. It's hard to hold onto that when I'm feeling down, but I can see how important it is to look at the bigger picture.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Em. It takes practice to challenge those deeply held negative beliefs, especially when we're feeling strong emotions. I'm wondering if we can use this situation to find some evidence for your new core belief, that you are worthy of love and connection, even if you're not perfect. What do you think this situation shows about your worthiness?\n\nPatient: I guess it shows that even if I'm feeling insecure or down, I'm still reaching out and trying to connect with people. That takes courage, and it shows that I value my relationships, even if it's scary sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's such a powerful reflection, Em. You're absolutely right. The fact that you're willing to reach out and be vulnerable, even when it's difficult, is a sign of your strength and your commitment to building meaningful connections. That's really important evidence for your new core belief. How does it feel to acknowledge that?\n\nPatient: It feels good to recognize that. It's still hard to fully believe it, but I can see how this situation actually shows my worthiness, rather than disproving it.\n\nTherapist: That's a really significant shift in perspective. It takes time and practice to internalize new beliefs, but every piece of evidence helps to build that foundation. I'm wondering if we can add this situation to your Positive Data Log, as evidence for your new core belief. How does that feel to you?\n\nPatient: That feels good. I like the idea of having a concrete record of evidence for my new belief, so I can look back on it when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: I think that's a great idea. Let's take a moment now to write down this situation and what it shows about your worthiness. We can add it to your log, and continue to build on it with other examples moving forward.",
