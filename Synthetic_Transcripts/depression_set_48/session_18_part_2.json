  "transcript": "Patient: I've been feeling really discouraged about my business lately. I keep thinking that I'm not making enough progress, and that I'm never going to be able to support myself with it. It's hard to stay motivated when I feel like I'm not getting anywhere.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why those thoughts would be discouraging, Em. Let's take a closer look at them. When you say you're not making enough progress, what do you mean by that? What would \"enough progress\" look like to you?\n\nPatient: I guess I feel like I should be further along by now. I've been working on this business for over a year, and I'm still not making a consistent income from it. I see other people who started their businesses around the same time as me, and they seem to be doing so much better. It makes me feel like I'm failing.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common feeling, Em. It's easy to compare ourselves to others and feel like we're falling short. But the truth is, everyone's journey is different, and there's no set timeline for success. Can you think of any reasons why your progress might look different from someone else's?\n\nPatient: Well, I know that I've had to deal with some challenges that other people might not have, like my depression and anxiety. That's made it harder for me to be consistent with my work sometimes. And I'm also trying to do everything myself, whereas some other people might have more support or resources.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important points, Em. It's true that your mental health challenges can impact your work, and that's not something to be ashamed of. It's also true that everyone has different resources and support systems. Can you think of any other factors that might be influencing your progress?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm also trying to be really careful about the decisions I make for my business, because I don't want to make any big mistakes. Sometimes that means I move a bit slower than other people might.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense, Em. It's good to be thoughtful and intentional about your business decisions. At the same time, it's possible that some of your fears about making mistakes might be holding you back. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that's probably true. I get really stuck in my head sometimes, worrying about all the things that could go wrong. It's hard to take action when I'm feeling that way.\n\nTherapist: I can definitely relate to that, Em. Worrying about potential negative outcomes can be really paralyzing. What do you think would happen if you tried to take some small actions, even if you weren't sure they would work out perfectly?\n\nPatient: I guess the worst that could happen is that I might make a mistake or fail at something. But I suppose that's not the end of the world. I could always try again or learn from it.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Em. Mistakes and failures are a normal part of any learning process, including starting a business. They don't mean that you're a failure as a person. What do you think might be the best-case scenario if you took some small actions, even if you weren't sure of the outcome?\n\nPatient: The best-case scenario is that something good could come out of it. Like maybe I'd make a sale, or get a new customer, or just learn something valuable. I guess there's really no way to know unless I try.\n\nTherapist: That's so true, Em. There's no way to know unless you try. And even if the outcome isn't perfect, there's always something to be learned. What do you think about trying to focus on the potential positive outcomes, instead of just the potential negative ones?\n\nPatient: I think that could be really helpful. It's just hard to do sometimes, when the negative thoughts are so loud.\n\nTherapist: I completely understand that, Em. It takes practice to shift our focus like that. One thing that can be helpful is to try to balance out the negative thoughts with some more realistic or optimistic ones. For example, instead of thinking \"I'm never going to be able to support myself with this business,\" you could try thinking something like \"I'm still learning and growing, and every small step I take brings me closer to my goals.\" How does that feel to you?",
