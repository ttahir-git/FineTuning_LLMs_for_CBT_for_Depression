  "transcript": "Patient: I feel good about using the coping cards. Having those reminders handy will be really helpful when I'm struggling. It's also nice to have a physical representation of the progress I've made and the new beliefs I'm working on.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find the coping cards helpful, Em. They can be a powerful tool for reinforcing your new beliefs and supporting yourself in challenging moments. Remember, the more you practice using them, the more automatic and natural it will feel to challenge your old beliefs and embrace your new, more adaptive ones.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and talk about your wellness action plan. This is another important tool for maintaining your progress and managing potential setbacks after our sessions have ended. Have you had a chance to think about what you'd like to include in your wellness action plan?\n\nPatient: I've been thinking about it a bit. I know I want to include some of the coping strategies we've discussed, like the thought records and coping cards. I also want to make sure I have a plan for reaching out for support when I need it, whether that's to friends or a professional.\n\nTherapist: Those are great elements to include in your wellness action plan, Em. It's important to have a range of strategies and supports to draw on when you're facing challenges. Another key aspect of the plan is identifying early warning signs that your depression symptoms may be worsening. This can help you take action sooner and prevent a more serious relapse. What do you think might be some early warning signs for you?\n\nPatient: I think some early warning signs for me might be withdrawing from friends and activities I usually enjoy, having trouble sleeping or sleeping too much, and noticing an increase in negative thoughts and self-criticism.\n\nTherapist: Those are really insightful observations, Em. Being able to recognize those early warning signs is a crucial part of maintaining your well-being. In your wellness action plan, you can outline specific steps you'll take if you notice these signs, such as reaching out to a friend, practicing extra self-care, or scheduling a booster therapy session. The goal is to have a clear, actionable plan that you can follow when you need it most.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of having a clear plan to follow. It takes some of the pressure off in those moments when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Em. Having a wellness action plan can provide a sense of structure and support during challenging times. It's a way of being proactive about your mental health and well-being. As we continue to develop your plan, remember that it's a living document \u2013 you can update and modify it as you learn more about what works best for you.\n\nNow, I'd like to introduce another technique that can be helpful for reinforcing your new beliefs and maintaining your progress. It's called a meta-thought record. Essentially, it's a thought record about the experience of CBT itself and the progress you've made. It can help you address any concerns or anxieties you may have about ending therapy and give you a chance to reflect on your growth. What do you think about giving that a try?",
