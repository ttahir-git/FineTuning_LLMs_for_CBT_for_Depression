  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Em, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted support person. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm not able to observe or interpret your non-verbal cues, so please let me know if I miss or misinterpret anything. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being upfront about your limitations. I feel comfortable continuing our work together.\n\nTherapist: Great, I appreciate your understanding. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes in your mood, thoughts, or behaviors that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: It's been a bit of a roller coaster. I had a few good days where I felt more motivated and engaged, but then I hit a low point again. I'm still struggling with finding evidence for my new core belief that I'm worthy of love and connection. It's hard to believe it when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging it can be to hold onto new beliefs when you're experiencing low moods. Remember that this is a process, and it's normal to have ups and downs. Let's explore this further. Can you share an example of a situation where you struggled to find evidence for your new core belief?\n\nPatient: Well, I reached out to a friend to make plans, and they didn't respond for several days. My mind immediately went to the thought that they don't value our friendship or care about me. It was hard to find evidence against that thought when I was feeling rejected.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, and I appreciate you sharing it. We can definitely work on building evidence for your new core belief in situations like this. Before we dive deeper, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize? We could explore the situation with your friend further, review your progress with the Positive Data Log and thought records, or introduce some new coping skills.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on the situation with my friend and how it relates to my core belief. I'm also curious about any new coping skills that might help me when I'm feeling really low.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. We can start by exploring the situation with your friend and how it connects to your thoughts and core beliefs. Then, I'll introduce a new coping skill called \"radical acceptance\" that can help you manage difficult emotions. We'll also review your progress with the Positive Data Log and thought records. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.",
