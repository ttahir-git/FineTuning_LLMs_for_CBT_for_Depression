  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for CBT session 4 with Amir:\n\nPatient: The thought monitoring and reframing exercises were challenging, but also eye-opening. I noticed that I have a lot of negative thoughts related to guilt and shame, especially when it comes to my adoptive family. I tried to reframe them, but it was difficult to believe the alternative thoughts at times.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're noticing these patterns, Amir. Reframing thoughts can be challenging, especially when we've been thinking in a certain way for a long time. Can you give me an example of a thought you tried to reframe and what made it difficult to believe the alternative?\n\nPatient: Sure. I had the thought, \"I'm a burden to my adoptive family because of my struggles with addiction and depression.\" I tried to reframe it as, \"I'm going through a difficult time, but I'm working on improving myself, and my family loves and supports me.\" But it was hard to fully believe that because I feel like I've caused them so much pain already.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, and I can understand why it's difficult to reframe that thought. When we have strong emotions like guilt and shame, it can be hard to see things from a different perspective. One technique that can be helpful is to look for evidence that supports the alternative thought. For example, have there been times when your family has expressed love and support for you, even during your struggles?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess there have been moments like that. My parents have told me they're proud of me for getting help and that they just want me to be happy and healthy. And my partner, Sam, has been incredibly supportive throughout everything.\n\nTherapist: That's really important to acknowledge. Those moments of love and support are evidence that you're not a burden to your family. It might be helpful to write down those instances and refer back to them when you're struggling with negative thoughts. Another technique is to ask yourself what you would say to a friend who was in a similar situation. Would you tell them they're a burden, or would you offer them compassion and understanding?\n\nPatient: I would definitely try to be compassionate and understanding towards a friend. I guess I have a hard time extending that same compassion to myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a common struggle, Amir. We're often harder on ourselves than we are on others. Practicing self-compassion is an important part of reframing negative thoughts. It might be helpful to imagine what you would say to a friend and then try to apply those same words of kindness and understanding to yourself.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to keep that in mind when I'm doing the thought reframing exercises.\n\nTherapist: Great. And remember, reframing thoughts is a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. Now, let's talk a bit about your relationship with your adoptive family. You mentioned that you'd like to improve communication and set healthy boundaries. Can you tell me more about what you hope to achieve in this area?",
