  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I appreciate you sharing those limitations, Nova. It's good to know what to expect. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the techniques we've discussed, like the thought records and cognitive rehearsal. It's been challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making some progress. I had a job interview last week, and while I was really nervous beforehand, I tried to use the behavioral experiment we designed to challenge my negative predictions.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed and that you're noticing some progress. I'm curious to learn more about your experience with the job interview and the behavioral experiment. Before we dive into that, let's take a moment to check in on your overall mood and any changes you've noticed since our last session. How would you describe your emotional state over the past week?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. I had some moments of feeling really hopeful and motivated, especially after the job interview. But there were also times when I felt really down and hopeless, like when I didn't hear back from the interviewer for a few days. I started to spiral into negative thoughts about not being good enough and how I'll never find a job. But I tried to use the thought records to challenge those thoughts and remind myself of my new core belief.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience ups and downs, especially when facing situations that trigger our negative thoughts and beliefs. I'm glad to hear that you were able to use the thought records and your new core belief to challenge those negative thoughts when they arose. It shows that you're developing the skills to manage your emotional responses in a healthier way. Let's talk more about the job interview and the behavioral experiment. What was the outcome of the experiment, and how did it impact your thoughts and feelings about the interview?\n\nPatient: The behavioral experiment helped me approach the interview with a more balanced perspective. Instead of assuming that I would fail or that the interviewer would judge me harshly, I tried to focus on the evidence that I was qualified for the position and that I had prepared as much as I could. After the interview, I felt proud of myself for challenging my negative predictions and for presenting myself in the best way possible. Even though I haven't heard back yet, I feel more hopeful about my chances and my ability to handle future interviews.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how challenging our negative predictions and gathering evidence can help us approach situations with a more balanced and realistic perspective. It's wonderful that you were able to feel proud of yourself for your efforts and to maintain hope, even in the face of uncertainty. This is a significant step in reframing your core beliefs and building resilience. As we continue our work together, we'll explore more ways to strengthen these skills and apply them to various aspects of your life. For today's session, what would you like to focus on? We can discuss the job interview and behavioral experiment in more detail, or we can explore any other challenges or successes you've experienced since our last session.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on the job interview and behavioral experiment a bit more, as it's been a significant event for me recently. I also want to discuss some challenges I've been having with my family and how it's been affecting my mood and thoughts. I feel like I'm making progress in some areas, but I still struggle with feelings of worthlessness and the belief that I need to earn love and support through my achievements.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan for today's session. We can start by discussing the job interview and behavioral experiment in more detail, exploring how it relates to your core beliefs and the progress you've made in challenging negative thoughts. Then, we can shift our focus to the challenges you've been experiencing with your family and how it's impacting your mood and thoughts. We'll work on identifying any underlying beliefs or assumptions that may be contributing to these struggles and develop strategies for managing them in a healthier way. Does that sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I appreciate you being open to addressing the topics that are most important to me right now.\n\nTherapist: Of course, Amir. This is your therapy, and it's essential that we focus on the issues that are most relevant and pressing for you. Let's start with the job interview and behavioral experiment. Can you walk me through your thought process leading up to the interview and how you applied the behavioral experiment to challenge your negative predictions?",
