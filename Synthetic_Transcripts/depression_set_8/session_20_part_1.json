  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to use the coping cards and wellness action plan we created, and it has helped me manage my stress and anxiety a bit better. I also reached out to a friend from the support group, and we had a nice chat over coffee. It felt good to connect with someone who understands what I'm going through.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been using the coping cards and wellness action plan, and that they've been helpful in managing your stress and anxiety. Reaching out to a friend from your support group is also a wonderful step towards building your support network. How have you been feeling emotionally since our last session?\n\nPatient: I've had some ups and downs emotionally. There are moments when I feel hopeful and motivated, especially after using the coping cards or talking to a friend. But there are also times when I still feel overwhelmed and discouraged, particularly when I think about my job search and the uncertainty of my future.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to have those ups and downs, especially when facing challenges like job searching. Remember that it's okay to have a range of emotions, and it's important to acknowledge and validate them. Today, I'd like to focus on reinforcing the skills you've learned during our time together and discuss how you can continue using them independently. We can also explore any remaining concerns or anxieties you have about ending therapy. Does that sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I'd like to talk more about how I can continue using these skills on my own and how to cope with any challenges that may arise after our sessions end.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's add those topics to our agenda for today. We'll also review your homework and progress since the last session. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: I'd also like to discuss how I can continue to build my support network and maintain the progress I've made in managing my depression symptoms.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss strategies for building your support network and maintaining your progress. So, our agenda for today includes:\n1. Reviewing your homework and progress since the last session\n2. Reinforcing the skills you've learned and discussing how to use them independently\n3. Exploring any remaining concerns or anxieties about ending therapy\n4. Discussing strategies for building your support network\n5. Addressing how to maintain your progress in managing depression symptoms\n\nLet's start by reviewing your homework. How did you find creating your wellness action plan and coping cards?",
