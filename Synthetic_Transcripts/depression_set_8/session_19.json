It's great to see you for our 19th session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information or lack the ability to interpret non-verbal cues. In case of a crisis or emergency, I'm not equipped to provide direct intervention, and I strongly encourage you to seek appropriate help from a qualified professional or emergency services.\n\nWith that said, let's start by checking in on how you've been doing since our last session. How have you been feeling, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to apply the CBT techniques we've discussed, especially when it comes to managing my stress and anxiety related to job searching. It's still challenging, but I feel like I'm making some progress. I've also been trying to prioritize self-care, like going for walks and engaging in hobbies, which has helped a bit with my mood.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been applying the CBT techniques and prioritizing self-care, Amir. Making progress, even if it feels small, is a significant accomplishment. Let's explore your experiences with the techniques in more detail. How have you been using thought records and cognitive restructuring when it comes to job search-related stress and anxiety?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to catch myself when I start having negative thoughts about my job search, like \"I'll never find a job\" or \"I'm not good enough.\" When I notice these thoughts, I try to challenge them by looking for evidence that contradicts them. For example, I remind myself of my qualifications and past successes. It's not always easy, but I've been able to reframe some of my thoughts into more balanced, realistic ones.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example of using thought records and cognitive restructuring, Amir. Challenging those negative thoughts and finding evidence to support more balanced, realistic thoughts is a crucial skill. It's normal for it to feel difficult at times, but with practice, it becomes more natural. Have you noticed any changes in your emotional state or behavior when you successfully reframe your thoughts?\n\nPatient: I have noticed some changes. When I'm able to challenge those negative thoughts, I feel a bit more hopeful and motivated. It's like a weight is lifted off my shoulders, and I'm more likely to take action, like applying for a job or reaching out for an informational interview. However, there are still times when the negative thoughts feel overwhelming, and it's hard to reframe them.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've noticed those positive changes in your emotional state and behavior when you challenge negative thoughts. That's a clear indication that the CBT techniques are working for you. It's also normal to have moments when the negative thoughts feel overwhelming. In those cases, it can be helpful to have some go-to coping statements or self-care activities that you can turn to. We can discuss some options for those today.\n\nNow, let's set an agenda for our session. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be beneficial to:\n\n1. Review your progress with thought records and cognitive restructuring in more detail\n2. Discuss coping strategies for when negative thoughts feel overwhelming\n3. Explore your experiences with goal-setting and celebrating small wins\n4. Check in on your job search progress and self-care activities\n5. Introduce the concept of relapse prevention planning\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?\n\nPatient: The agenda sounds good to me. I don't have anything else to add at the moment.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's dive in. First, I'd like to review your progress with thought records and cognitive restructuring in more detail. Can you share an example of a specific situation where you successfully used these techniques to manage job search-related stress and anxiety?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I applied for a job that I thought was a perfect fit for my skills and experience. A few days later, I received a generic rejection email. Immediately, I started having thoughts like, \"I'm never going to find a job\" and \"I'm not good enough.\" I felt really discouraged and hopeless. But then I remembered our discussions about thought records and cognitive restructuring.\n\nI took a step back and tried to identify the evidence that supported and contradicted my negative thoughts. I reminded myself that I've had successes in the past and that one rejection doesn't define my worth or abilities. I also considered alternative explanations, like the possibility that the job was already filled internally or that there were many qualified applicants.\n\nBy challenging my negative thoughts and considering alternative perspectives, I was able to reframe my thinking. Instead of \"I'm never going to find a job,\" I thought, \"This rejection is disappointing, but it doesn't mean I won't find a job in the future.\" And instead of \"I'm not good enough,\" I thought, \"I have valuable skills and experiences, and the right opportunity will come along.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent example of using thought records and cognitive restructuring, Amir. You did a great job of identifying your negative thoughts, examining the evidence, and developing more balanced, realistic thoughts. How did this process impact your emotional state and behavior after receiving the rejection email?\n\nPatient: After I reframed my thoughts, I felt less discouraged and hopeless. I still felt disappointed, but it didn't consume me as much. I was able to move forward with my day and continue my job search efforts. In the past, a rejection like that might have caused me to spiral into self-doubt and give up on my job search for the day. But this time, I was able to bounce back more quickly.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that using thought records and cognitive restructuring helped you manage your emotional state and maintain your job search efforts, even in the face of disappointment. This is a clear example of how challenging negative thoughts can lead to more adaptive emotions and behaviors.\n\nYou mentioned earlier that there are still times when negative thoughts feel overwhelming, and it's hard to reframe them. Let's discuss some coping strategies for those moments. One helpful technique is to create coping cards with reminders of your new, more balanced thoughts and beliefs. These cards can serve as tangible tools to ground you when negative thoughts feel overwhelming.\n\nFor example, you could create a card that says, \"Rejections are disappointing, but they don't define my worth or abilities. I have valuable skills and experiences, and the right opportunity will come along.\" You can keep these cards with you and pull them out when you need a reminder of your new, more adaptive thoughts.\n\nWhat do you think about creating some coping cards for yourself?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of coping cards. Having a physical reminder of my new, more balanced thoughts could be really helpful in those moments when negative thoughts feel overwhelming. It's like having a little pep talk in my pocket.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Coping cards can be a powerful tool for grounding yourself and refocusing on more adaptive thoughts. I encourage you to create a few cards based on the alternative thoughts and beliefs we've discussed in our sessions. You can keep them in your wallet, on your phone, or anywhere that's easily accessible when you need them.\n\nAnother helpful coping strategy is to engage in self-care activities when negative thoughts feel overwhelming. Doing something that brings you joy, relaxation, or a sense of accomplishment can help shift your focus and improve your mood. What are some self-care activities that you find helpful?\n\nPatient: I find going for walks in nature to be really calming and grounding. It helps me clear my head and gain perspective. I also enjoy reading and listening to music. When I'm feeling creative, I like to work on DIY projects around the house or in the garden.\n\nTherapist: Those are great self-care activities, Amir. Engaging in activities that bring you a sense of calm, joy, or accomplishment can be a powerful antidote to negative thoughts. I encourage you to make a list of your favorite self-care activities and keep it handy, so you have go-to options when you need them.\n\nNow, let's explore your experiences with goal-setting and celebrating small wins. How has this process been for you?\n\nPatient: Setting small, achievable goals has been helpful for me. It breaks down the job search process into more manageable steps and gives me a sense of progress and accomplishment. For example, instead of setting a broad goal like \"find a job,\" I set smaller goals like \"apply to three jobs this week\" or \"reach out to one professional contact for an informational interview.\"\n\nCelebrating small wins has also been important. In the past, I would only focus on the end goal and dismiss any progress along the way. But now, I try to acknowledge and celebrate the small victories, like completing a job application or having a positive networking conversation. It helps me stay motivated and reminds me that I'm making progress, even if it feels slow at times.\n\nTherapist: Setting small, achievable goals and celebrating small wins are excellent strategies for maintaining motivation and perspective during the job search process. It's great to hear that you're applying these techniques and finding them helpful.\n\nAs we discussed in our last session, it's also important to set goals and celebrate wins related to self-care and other areas of your life, not just job search. This helps create a more balanced and fulfilling life overall. Have you been setting goals and celebrating wins in other areas of your life as well?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to set goals and celebrate wins related to my self-care and personal life as well. For example, I set a goal to go for a walk in nature at least three times a week, and I celebrate when I follow through with that. I also set a goal to call a friend or family member once a week to stay connected and supported.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Amir. Setting goals and celebrating wins in multiple areas of your life helps create a sense of balance and overall well-being. It's not just about achieving external goals like finding a job; it's also about taking care of yourself and nurturing your relationships and personal growth.\n\nNow, let's check in on your job search progress and self-care activities. How have things been going in those areas since our last session?\n\nPatient: The job search is still challenging and slow-going, but I'm continuing to make progress. I've been applying to jobs regularly and reaching out for informational interviews. I haven't landed anything yet, but I'm trying to stay persistent and hopeful.\n\nIn terms of self-care, I've been doing pretty well with going for walks, reading, and engaging in hobbies. There are still days when I struggle to motivate myself, but I'm trying to be gentle with myself and celebrate the small wins, like you said.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you're making consistent efforts in your job search and self-care, even though it's not always easy. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. The key is to keep showing up for yourself and your goals, even when it feels challenging.\n\nI want to acknowledge the effort and resilience you've been demonstrating in your job search and self-care. It takes a lot of courage and persistence to keep going in the face of setbacks and uncertainty. You're doing a great job of applying the CBT techniques we've discussed, and I encourage you to keep building on that momentum.\n\nNow, I'd like to introduce the concept of relapse prevention planning. Relapse prevention is about creating a plan to maintain the progress you've made in therapy and manage potential setbacks or challenges that may arise in the future.\n\nOne key aspect of relapse prevention is identifying early warning signs that your depression symptoms may be worsening. These signs can be different for everyone, but some common ones include increased negative thoughts, decreased motivation or energy, changes in sleep or appetite, or withdrawing from activities or relationships.\n\nWhat early warning signs have you noticed in the past when your depression symptoms start to worsen?\n\nPatient: When my depression symptoms start to worsen, I notice that I have more negative thoughts about myself and my future. I might think things like \"I'll never be happy\" or \"I'm a burden to others.\" I also tend to lose motivation and energy for activities I usually enjoy, like going for walks or working on projects. My sleep patterns can change too - I might have trouble falling asleep or want to sleep all the time.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of early warning signs, Amir. Recognizing these signs is an important part of relapse prevention because it allows you to take action early on, before your symptoms worsen further. \n\nLet's discuss some strategies you can use when you notice these early warning signs. One effective strategy is to review your thought records and coping cards. Reminding yourself of the alternative, more balanced thoughts you've developed can help counteract the negative thoughts that may be resurfacing.\n\nAnother strategy is to prioritize self-care activities, even if you don't feel motivated. Engaging in activities that usually bring you joy, relaxation, or a sense of accomplishment can help boost your mood and energy. It's also important to reach out for support when you're struggling. This could mean talking to a trusted friend or family member, attending a support group, or scheduling a \"booster\" therapy session.\n\nWhat do you think about these strategies? Do you have any other ideas for managing early warning signs?\n\nPatient: Those strategies make sense to me. Reviewing my thought records and coping cards could help me challenge the negative thoughts that creep up. And even though it's hard to motivate myself when I'm feeling down, I know that engaging in self-care activities usually helps me feel a bit better.\n\nI also like the idea of reaching out for support. Sometimes I hesitate to do that because I don't want to burden others, but I know that my partner and close friends are always there for me. Maybe I could also look into joining a support group for people with depression. It could be helpful to connect with others who understand what I'm going through.\n\nTherapist: Those are great ideas, Amir. Challenging negative thoughts, engaging in self-care, and seeking support are all powerful tools for managing early warning signs of depression. I especially like your idea of joining a support group. Connecting with others who have similar experiences can provide a sense of validation, understanding, and community.\n\nAnother important aspect of relapse prevention is creating a \"wellness action plan.\" This is a written plan that outlines specific steps you can take if your depression symptoms start to worsen. The plan might include things like:\n\n- Reviewing your thought records and coping cards daily\n- Scheduling at least one self-care activity per day\n- Reaching out to a specific support person (e.g., partner, friend, therapist) \n- Attending a support group meeting\n- Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation\n- Engaging in physical activity, such as going for a walk or doing a gentle yoga routine\n\nThe key is to have a concrete plan in place so that you don't have to think too hard about what to do when you're feeling overwhelmed. Having a written plan can provide guidance and structure during difficult times.\n\nWhat do you think about creating a wellness action plan? What specific steps would you include in your plan?\n\nPatient: I think creating a wellness action plan is a great idea. It would give me a clear roadmap to follow when I'm struggling. Some specific steps I would include are:\n\n- Reviewing my thought records and coping cards every morning and evening\n- Scheduling at least one self-care activity per day, like going for a walk or reading \n- Calling or texting my partner or a close friend when I need support\n- Attending a support group meeting once a week\n- Practicing deep breathing or meditation for 10 minutes every day\n- Doing some form of physical activity, like yoga or stretching, for at least 15 minutes a day\n\nHaving this plan written down will make it easier for me to take action when I'm feeling overwhelmed or depressed.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent wellness action plan, Amir. You've included a great mix of CBT techniques, self-care activities, and support strategies. Writing it down and committing to specific steps will make it much easier to follow through when you're struggling.\n\nI want to acknowledge the progress you've made in our work together. You've developed a strong understanding of CBT concepts and have been consistently applying the techniques we've discussed. You've also shown a lot of resilience and self-awareness throughout this process.\n\nAs we wrap up our session today, I'd like to assign some homework to help you continue building on the progress you've made. First, I encourage you to create your wellness action plan and coping cards this week. Put them in a place where you can easily access them when needed.\n\nSecond, continue practicing your thought records and cognitive restructuring skills. Aim to complete at least one thought record per day, focusing on any situations that trigger strong emotional responses.\n\nFinally, engage in at least one self-care activity per day and reach out to a support person at least once this week. This could be attending a support group meeting, calling a friend, or having a conversation with your partner about how they can support you in your wellness plan.\n\nHow do these homework assignments feel for you?\n\nPatient: The homework assignments feel manageable and helpful. Creating the wellness action plan and coping cards will give me tangible tools to use when I'm struggling. And continuing with the thought records and self-care activities will help me maintain the progress I've made.\n\nI'm also glad you included reaching out for support in the homework. Sometimes I need that extra reminder to lean on others when I'm going through a tough time.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad the homework assignments feel manageable and helpful for you, Amir. Remember, the goal is to continue building on the progress you've made and to have a clear plan in place for managing challenges that may arise.\n\nBefore we end our session, I want to check in on how you're feeling now. What thoughts and emotions are coming up for you as we wrap up?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a mix of emotions right now. I feel proud of the progress I've made and grateful for the tools and strategies I've learned in our sessions. At the same time, I feel a bit nervous about continuing this work on my own. It's comforting to know that I have a plan in place and can always reach out for support if needed.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions as we wrap up our sessions together. It's a big transition to go from having regular therapy sessions to applying these skills independently. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. The key is to keep showing up for yourself and using the tools and strategies you've learned.\n\nI have confidence in your ability to continue this work independently. You've demonstrated a strong commitment to your growth and well-being, and you have a solid plan in place for managing challenges. Remember, you can always schedule a \"booster\" session if you need additional support down the line.\n\nThank you for your hard work and dedication throughout our sessions together, Amir. It's been a pleasure working with you and witnessing your progress.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed progress with thought records and cognitive restructuring in managing job search-related stress and anxiety\n  - Discussed coping strategies for when negative thoughts feel overwhelming, including creating coping cards and engaging in self-care activities\n  - Explored experiences with goal-setting and celebrating small wins in job search and self-care\n  - Checked in on job search progress and self-care activities\n  - Introduced concept of relapse prevention planning and created a wellness action plan\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (continued from previous sessions): Reviewed examples of successfully using thought records to manage job search-related stress and anxiety\n  - Cognitive restructuring (continued from previous sessions): Discussed examples of challenging negative thoughts and developing more balanced, realistic thoughts\n  - Coping cards (introduced in this session): Created coping cards with reminders of new, more balanced thoughts and beliefs to use when negative thoughts feel overwhelming\n  - Goal-setting and celebrating small wins (continued from previous sessions): Explored experiences with setting small, achievable goals and celebrating progress in job search and self-care\n  - Relapse prevention planning (introduced in this session): Identified early warning signs of worsening depression symptoms and created a wellness action plan with specific steps to take when struggling\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Create wellness action plan and coping cards\n  - Complete at least one thought record per day, focusing on situations that trigger strong emotional responses\n  - Engage in at least one self-care activity per day\n  - Reach out to a support person at least once this week (e.g., attend a support group meeting, call a friend, or have a conversation with partner about how they can provide support)\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details:\n  - Amir has made significant progress in recognizing and challenging negative thoughts related to job search experiences, which has helped reduce feelings of hopelessness and increase motivation\n  - Amir continues to struggle with stress and anxiety related to the job search process but is actively working on developing more balanced, realistic thoughts and prioritizing self-care\n  - Amir's depression symptoms, such as feelings of guilt, shame, and worthlessness, are still present but are being addressed through CBT techniques and reframing core beliefs\n  - Amir is working on setting small, achievable goals for job search and self-care and celebrating progress and accomplishments to maintain motivation and boost mood\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Old core belief: \"I'm worthless and unlovable.\"\n  - New core belief: \"I have intrinsic worth and am lovable, even when I'm struggling or make mistakes.\"\n  - Intermediate belief: \"I must earn love and support through success and meeting others' expectations.\"\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue to monitor Amir's progress with thought records, cognitive restructuring, goal-setting, and celebrating small wins in various situations related to career and relationships\n  - Explore any changes or patterns in Amir's emotional state and depression symptoms\n  - Address any challenges or successes Amir experiences in implementing their new core belief and practicing CBT techniques in various situations\n  - Follow up on Amir's job search progress and self-care activities and explore any insights or challenges that arise\n  - Review and update Amir's wellness action plan and coping cards as needed\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review Amir's homework, including their progress with creating a wellness action plan, coping cards, thought records, self-care activities, and reaching out for support\n  - Discuss any challenges or successes Amir experienced in implementing their new core belief and practicing CBT techniques in various situations\n  - Explore any changes or patterns in Amir's emotional state and depression symptoms\n  - Follow up on Amir's job search progress and self-care activities and explore any insights or challenges that arose\n  - Introduce new CBT techniques or strategies based on Amir's progress and needs, such as addressing specific depressive symptoms or introducing new cognitive and behavioral experiments\n\n",
