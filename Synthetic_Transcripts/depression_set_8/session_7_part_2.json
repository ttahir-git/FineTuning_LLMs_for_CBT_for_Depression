  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by discussing your relationship with your adoptive family and the guilt you've been feeling. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and beliefs that have been coming up for you around this?\n\nPatient: Well, I keep thinking that I've disappointed them and that they must regret adopting me. I feel like I've caused them so much pain and stress, especially with my struggles with addiction and depression. I worry that they see me as a burden and that they'd be better off without me.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts and feelings are understandable given your experiences, Amir. Let's take a closer look at them. Can you identify any cognitive distortions in those thoughts, such as all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, or jumping to conclusions?\n\nPatient: I guess I am jumping to conclusions a bit. I don't really know how they feel about me, and I'm assuming the worst. And maybe I'm overgeneralizing too, thinking that because I've struggled in the past, I'll always be a disappointment to them.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Amir. You're recognizing that your thoughts may not be entirely accurate or based on evidence. Let's explore this further. What evidence do you have that your adoptive family sees you as a burden or regrets adopting you?\n\nPatient: Well, when I was struggling with addiction, there were times when they expressed frustration and disappointment. But they never said they regretted adopting me. And even though we've had our challenges, they've always been there for me and supported me in getting help.\n\nTherapist: That's important to acknowledge. It sounds like despite the difficulties, your adoptive family has shown care and support for you. Let's look at this from another perspective. What would you say to a friend who was in a similar situation and expressed these same thoughts and feelings?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that they shouldn't be so hard on themselves and that their family loves them unconditionally. I'd remind them that everyone makes mistakes and goes through tough times, but that doesn't mean they're a burden or undeserving of love.\n\nTherapist: That's a very compassionate response, Amir. What do you think it would be like to apply that same compassion and understanding to yourself?\n\nPatient: It's hard, but I guess I should try to be kinder to myself and recognize that my struggles don't define me. My family loves me, and I need to trust in that love and not assume the worst.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Challenging these negative thoughts and beliefs takes practice, but it's an important step in improving your relationship with yourself and your adoptive family. Let's move on to discussing the challenges you've been facing with motivation and engaging in activities. How has that been going?",
