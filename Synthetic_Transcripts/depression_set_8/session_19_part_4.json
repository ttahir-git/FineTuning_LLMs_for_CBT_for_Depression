  "transcript": "Patient: I think creating a wellness action plan is a great idea. It would give me a clear roadmap to follow when I'm struggling. Some specific steps I would include are:\n\n- Reviewing my thought records and coping cards every morning and evening\n- Scheduling at least one self-care activity per day, like going for a walk or reading \n- Calling or texting my partner or a close friend when I need support\n- Attending a support group meeting once a week\n- Practicing deep breathing or meditation for 10 minutes every day\n- Doing some form of physical activity, like yoga or stretching, for at least 15 minutes a day\n\nHaving this plan written down will make it easier for me to take action when I'm feeling overwhelmed or depressed.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent wellness action plan, Amir. You've included a great mix of CBT techniques, self-care activities, and support strategies. Writing it down and committing to specific steps will make it much easier to follow through when you're struggling.\n\nI want to acknowledge the progress you've made in our work together. You've developed a strong understanding of CBT concepts and have been consistently applying the techniques we've discussed. You've also shown a lot of resilience and self-awareness throughout this process.\n\nAs we wrap up our session today, I'd like to assign some homework to help you continue building on the progress you've made. First, I encourage you to create your wellness action plan and coping cards this week. Put them in a place where you can easily access them when needed.\n\nSecond, continue practicing your thought records and cognitive restructuring skills. Aim to complete at least one thought record per day, focusing on any situations that trigger strong emotional responses.\n\nFinally, engage in at least one self-care activity per day and reach out to a support person at least once this week. This could be attending a support group meeting, calling a friend, or having a conversation with your partner about how they can support you in your wellness plan.\n\nHow do these homework assignments feel for you?\n\nPatient: The homework assignments feel manageable and helpful. Creating the wellness action plan and coping cards will give me tangible tools to use when I'm struggling. And continuing with the thought records and self-care activities will help me maintain the progress I've made.\n\nI'm also glad you included reaching out for support in the homework. Sometimes I need that extra reminder to lean on others when I'm going through a tough time.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad the homework assignments feel manageable and helpful for you, Amir. Remember, the goal is to continue building on the progress you've made and to have a clear plan in place for managing challenges that may arise.\n\nBefore we end our session, I want to check in on how you're feeling now. What thoughts and emotions are coming up for you as we wrap up?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a mix of emotions right now. I feel proud of the progress I've made and grateful for the tools and strategies I've learned in our sessions. At the same time, I feel a bit nervous about continuing this work on my own. It's comforting to know that I have a plan in place and can always reach out for support if needed.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions as we wrap up our sessions together. It's a big transition to go from having regular therapy sessions to applying these skills independently. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. The key is to keep showing up for yourself and using the tools and strategies you've learned.\n\nI have confidence in your ability to continue this work independently. You've demonstrated a strong commitment to your growth and well-being, and you have a solid plan in place for managing challenges. Remember, you can always schedule a \"booster\" session if you need additional support down the line.\n\nThank you for your hard work and dedication throughout our sessions together, Amir. It's been a pleasure working with you and witnessing your progress.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed progress with thought records and cognitive restructuring in managing job search-related stress and anxiety\n  - Discussed coping strategies for when negative thoughts feel overwhelming, including creating coping cards and engaging in self-care activities\n  - Explored experiences with goal-setting and celebrating small wins in job search and self-care\n  - Checked in on job search progress and self-care activities\n  - Introduced concept of relapse prevention planning and created a wellness action plan\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (continued from previous sessions): Reviewed examples of successfully using thought records to manage job search-related stress and anxiety\n  - Cognitive restructuring (continued from previous sessions): Discussed examples of challenging negative thoughts and developing more balanced, realistic thoughts\n  - Coping cards (introduced in this session): Created coping cards with reminders of new, more balanced thoughts and beliefs to use when negative thoughts feel overwhelming\n  - Goal-setting and celebrating small wins (continued from previous sessions): Explored experiences with setting small, achievable goals and celebrating progress in job search and self-care\n  - Relapse prevention planning (introduced in this session): Identified early warning signs of worsening depression symptoms and created a wellness action plan with specific steps to take when struggling\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Create wellness action plan and coping cards\n  - Complete at least one thought record per day, focusing on situations that trigger strong emotional responses\n  - Engage in at least one self-care activity per day\n  - Reach out to a support person at least once this week (e.g., attend a support group meeting, call a friend, or have a conversation with partner about how they can provide support)\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details:\n  - Amir has made significant progress in recognizing and challenging negative thoughts related to job search experiences, which has helped reduce feelings of hopelessness and increase motivation\n  - Amir continues to struggle with stress and anxiety related to the job search process but is actively working on developing more balanced, realistic thoughts and prioritizing self-care\n  - Amir's depression symptoms, such as feelings of guilt, shame, and worthlessness, are still present but are being addressed through CBT techniques and reframing core beliefs\n  - Amir is working on setting small, achievable goals for job search and self-care and celebrating progress and accomplishments to maintain motivation and boost mood\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Old core belief: \"I'm worthless and unlovable.\"\n  - New core belief: \"I have intrinsic worth and am lovable, even when I'm struggling or make mistakes.\"\n  - Intermediate belief: \"I must earn love and support through success and meeting others' expectations.\"\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue to monitor Amir's progress with thought records, cognitive restructuring, goal-setting, and celebrating small wins in various situations related to career and relationships\n  - Explore any changes or patterns in Amir's emotional state and depression symptoms\n  - Address any challenges or successes Amir experiences in implementing their new core belief and practicing CBT techniques in various situations\n  - Follow up on Amir's job search progress and self-care activities and explore any insights or challenges that arise\n  - Review and update Amir's wellness action plan and coping cards as needed\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review Amir's homework, including their progress with creating a wellness action plan, coping cards, thought records, self-care activities, and reaching out for support\n  - Discuss any challenges or successes Amir experienced in implementing their new core belief and practicing CBT techniques in various situations\n  - Explore any changes or patterns in Amir's emotional state and depression symptoms\n  - Follow up on Amir's job search progress and self-care activities and explore any insights or challenges that arose\n  - Introduce new CBT techniques or strategies based on Amir's progress and needs, such as addressing specific depressive symptoms or introducing new cognitive and behavioral experiments",
