  "transcript": "Patient: I'm comfortable discussing my core beliefs, but it's a difficult topic for me. I've always felt like I'm not good enough, and my struggles with addiction and depression have only reinforced that belief.\n\nTherapist: It takes courage to explore these deeply held beliefs, Amir. Let's start by using the downward arrow technique to uncover the roots of this belief. Can you think of a recent situation that triggered this thought of not being good enough?\n\nPatient: Well, last week I had a phone call with my parents, and they asked me about my job search. I felt like I had to lie and say that I was making progress, even though I haven't been putting in much effort. After the call, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'm a disappointment to them.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's use that situation as our starting point. If it's true that you're a disappointment to your parents, what do you think that means about you?\n\nPatient: It means that I'm not living up to their expectations, and I'm letting them down.\n\nTherapist: And if you're letting them down, what does that say about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It says that I'm a failure, and I'm not worthy of their love and support.\n\nTherapist: So, the core belief here seems to be \"I'm not worthy of love and support.\" Does that resonate with you, Amir?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that's the heart of it. I feel like I have to earn their love by being successful and making them proud.\n\nTherapist: That's a powerful insight, Amir. This belief that you have to earn love and support is something we call an intermediate belief. It's a rule or assumption that you have about how the world works. The core belief underneath it is that you're not inherently worthy of love, and that can be a very painful belief to hold.",
