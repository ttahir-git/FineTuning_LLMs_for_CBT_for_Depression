  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's dive into the conversation you had with your parents. Can you walk me through how it went and what thoughts and emotions came up for you during and after the conversation?\n\nPatient: Well, I was really nervous going into the conversation. I was worried that they wouldn't understand or that they would dismiss my struggles. But I tried to remind myself of the new core belief we've been working on - that I am worthy of love and support, even when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you were able to draw on the new core belief, even in a challenging situation. How did the conversation unfold?\n\nPatient: I started by expressing my appreciation for their love and support, but also shared how the pressure to meet their expectations had been impacting my mental health. I told them about my struggles with depression and how I've been working on challenging the belief that I need to earn their love and support.\n\nTherapist: That must have been a difficult thing to share. How did your parents respond?\n\nPatient: They were actually more understanding than I expected. They listened and expressed their concern for my well-being. They also shared their own struggles and how they sometimes project their fears and expectations onto me.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like the conversation led to a deeper understanding between you and your parents. How did this experience relate to your belief about love and support being conditional?\n\nPatient: It definitely challenged that belief. My parents showed me that their love and support are not solely based on my achievements or meeting their expectations. It made me realize that I need to continue working on internalizing this new understanding.\n\nTherapist: That's a powerful insight, Amir. Challenging long-held beliefs takes time and repeated experiences that contradict the old belief. This conversation with your parents is a significant piece of evidence that supports your new core belief. Let's add this to your Positive Data Log.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I can see how keeping track of experiences like this can help reinforce the new belief.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. As we continue to gather evidence that supports your new core belief, it will become easier to challenge the old belief when it arises. Now, let's explore how we can apply this new understanding to other areas of your life, such as your job search and relationships.",
