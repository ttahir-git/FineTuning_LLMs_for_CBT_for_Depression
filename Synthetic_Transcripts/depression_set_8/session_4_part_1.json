  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you again for session 4. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the thought monitoring and reframing techniques we discussed, but it's been challenging at times. I find myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns, especially when it comes to my relationship with my adoptive family.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you've been practicing the techniques we discussed, even if it's been challenging. It's normal to face difficulties when trying to change long-standing thought patterns. I appreciate you sharing your struggles with your adoptive family. Would you like to make that a focus of our session today, along with reviewing your homework and progress?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I'd also like to discuss some strategies for managing my stress and anxiety, as I've been feeling overwhelmed lately.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan. So, for today's agenda, we'll:\n1. Review your homework and progress with thought monitoring and reframing cognitive distortions.\n2. Discuss your relationship with your adoptive family and explore ways to improve communication and set healthy boundaries.\n3. Introduce some distress tolerance techniques to help manage stress and anxiety.\nDoes that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds great. I think that covers everything I wanted to discuss today.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's start by reviewing your homework. How did you find the thought monitoring and reframing exercises?",
