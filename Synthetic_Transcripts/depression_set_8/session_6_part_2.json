  "transcript": "Patient: I can think of a few times when my parents have shown me love and support. When I first came out as transgender, they were confused and had a lot of questions, but they never stopped loving me. They even defended me when other family members made hurtful comments. And when I was going through my addiction, they helped me find a treatment program and visited me regularly.\n\nTherapist: Those are really powerful examples of your parents' love and support. It's important to remember these moments, especially when you're feeling down or questioning your self-worth. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm never going to be the person they want me to be.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I know my parents had certain expectations for me, like having a successful career and starting a family of my own. I feel like I've disappointed them by not meeting those expectations.\n\nTherapist: I understand how that can make you feel like you're not living up to their expectations. Now, let's consider the evidence against this thought. Have your parents ever expressed that they're proud of you for other reasons, even if you haven't met those specific expectations?\n\nPatient: Yeah, they've told me they're proud of me for my sobriety and for being true to myself. They've also said they just want me to be happy, whatever that looks like for me.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important piece of evidence against the thought that you're not the person they want you to be. It sounds like your parents' love and support isn't conditional on you meeting certain expectations. They recognize and appreciate your efforts and the progress you've made, even if your path looks different from what they may have initially imagined.\n\nPatient: I guess you're right. It's just hard to shake those negative thoughts sometimes.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable that those thoughts persist, especially when you've been dealing with them for a long time. That's why we're working on reframing those thoughts and beliefs based on evidence, rather than just trying to push them away. As we continue to gather evidence against these negative thoughts, it will become easier to challenge them when they arise.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I just need to keep reminding myself of the evidence we've talked about.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And the more you practice this, the more automatic it will become. Now, let's move on to discussing your progress with the distress tolerance techniques we've been working on. How has it been going with practicing deep breathing, grounding exercises, and progressive muscle relaxation?\n\nPatient: It's been going pretty well. I've been trying to do deep breathing every day, and I've noticed that it helps me feel calmer when I'm starting to feel anxious. The grounding exercises have been helpful too, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I haven't practiced progressive muscle relaxation as much, but I want to try to do it more regularly.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing these techniques and finding them helpful. It's okay if you haven't practiced progressive muscle relaxation as much \u2013 the important thing is that you're making an effort to incorporate these tools into your daily life. As we continue to work together, we can explore other distress tolerance techniques that might be helpful for you.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm open to trying new things if they can help me manage my emotions better.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude to have. Now, let's talk about your progress with behavioral activation and activity scheduling. How has it been going with engaging in pleasurable activities and mastery activities?\n\nPatient: It's been a bit challenging, to be honest. Some days, I just don't feel motivated to do anything, even if I know it might make me feel better. But I have been trying to stick to the activity schedule we created, and I've noticed that I do feel a bit better after doing something, even if it's just a small task.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been sticking to the activity schedule, even when it's challenging. It's normal to have days where motivation is low, but the fact that you're still making an effort is really important. And it's great that you've noticed some improvement in your mood after engaging in activities. As we continue with behavioral activation, we can work on finding activities that are meaningful and enjoyable for you, so that it feels less like a chore and more like something you look forward to.",
