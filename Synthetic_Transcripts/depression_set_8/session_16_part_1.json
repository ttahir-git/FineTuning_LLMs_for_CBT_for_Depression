  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you again for session 16. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted support person. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and emotions openly. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being transparent about your limitations. I feel comfortable continuing our sessions with this in mind.\n\nTherapist: Great, I appreciate your understanding. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the techniques we've discussed, like thought records and behavioral activation. It's still a challenge some days, but I feel like I'm making progress. One thing that's been on my mind is my relationship with my adoptive family. I haven't talked to them much since I started therapy, and I feel guilty about that.\n\nTherapist: It's good to hear that you're making progress with the techniques we've been working on. I understand that feelings of guilt can be challenging, especially when it comes to family relationships. Let's add that to our agenda for today, along with reviewing your homework and discussing any other concerns you may have. Does that sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I'd also like to talk about how I can start applying these techniques to my job search, since that's been a source of stress for me.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss strategies for managing stress related to your job search. So, our agenda for today includes: reviewing your homework, discussing your relationship with your adoptive family, exploring how to apply CBT techniques to your job search, and addressing any other concerns that may come up. Is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers everything for now.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's start by reviewing your homework. How did you find the process of completing thought records and engaging in behavioral activation activities since our last session?",
