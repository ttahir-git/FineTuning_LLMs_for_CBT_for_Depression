We've covered a lot of ground, from discussing the conversation with your parents to practicing the thought record technique in relation to your job search. I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in challenging your negative thoughts and beliefs. It's not an easy process, but your commitment and effort are paying off.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a challenging journey, but I feel like I'm starting to see things in a different light. I know I still have a lot of work to do, but I'm hopeful that things will continue to improve.\n\nTherapist: Your hope and determination are essential to the therapeutic process. Remember, change takes time, and there will be ups and downs along the way. The key is to keep practicing the skills we've been working on and to be patient and compassionate with yourself.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best to keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: Before we wrap up today's session, let's discuss your homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought record technique, focusing on situations related to your job search and relationships. Try to set aside a specific time each day to complete a thought record, and don't forget to add any relevant experiences to your Positive Data Log.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll make sure to practice the thought record technique daily and update my Positive Data Log.\n\nTherapist: Great. In addition to the thought records, I'd also like you to engage in at least one behavioral activation activity per day. This can be something as simple as taking a walk, calling a friend, or working on a hobby. The goal is to engage in activities that bring you a sense of accomplishment or enjoyment, even if you don't feel motivated at first.\n\nPatient: I can do that. I'll try to plan out some activities for the week ahead.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea. Planning ahead can make it easier to follow through with your intentions. Finally, I'd like you to continue reflecting on your new core belief and how it applies to various situations in your life. When you catch yourself falling into old patterns of thinking, try to remind yourself of the evidence that supports your new belief.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best to keep challenging those old beliefs and reinforcing the new one.\n\nTherapist: Remember, it's a process, and it takes time. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Amir. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Before we end today's session, can you share with me how you're feeling right now and if there's anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also hopeful and motivated to keep working on myself. I don't have anything else to discuss right now, but I'll let you know if something comes up during the week.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel tired after such an emotionally engaging session. I'm glad to hear that you're also feeling hopeful and motivated. Remember, if anything does come up during the week, you can always bring it to our next session. Take care of yourself, Amir, and I look forward to seeing you next time.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I'll see you next week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Amir's conversation with parents and how it challenged their belief about love and support being conditional.\n  - Practiced thought record technique using a recent job search situation, focusing on identifying emotions, automatic thoughts, evidence for and against the thought, and generating alternative thoughts.\n  - Discussed the importance of regular practice and setting aside specific times to complete thought records and engage in behavioral activation activities.\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (continued from previous sessions): Practiced identifying automatic thoughts, emotions, and triggers in specific situations related to career and relationships.
