  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you again for session 10. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate, and I want to encourage you to use your judgment and critical thinking skills when considering my suggestions. Furthermore, as an AI, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Finally, since our interactions are text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and emotions openly through your words.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I appreciate your transparency about your limitations. I understand that our sessions are a collaborative effort, and I'm committed to being open and honest about my experiences and feelings.\n\nTherapist: I really appreciate your understanding and willingness to work together, Amir. Now, let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been doing alright. I've been trying to practice the techniques we've discussed, like thought records and cognitive rehearsal, but it's still a challenge sometimes. I find myself falling into old patterns of thinking, especially when it comes to my job search and interactions with my adoptive family.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to face challenges when implementing new skills, and I'm glad you're bringing this up. We can definitely explore those situations further and see how we can apply the techniques we've been working on. Have there been any moments where you felt the new core belief resonating with you, even if briefly?\n\nPatient: Yes, there have been a few instances where I caught myself starting to engage in negative self-talk, but then I remembered our discussions about my worth not being defined by external factors. It's not always easy to hold onto that belief, but it does help to remind myself of it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Amir. Recognizing those moments and interrupting the negative self-talk is a significant step forward. We can work on strengthening that new core belief and finding ways to make it more accessible when you need it.\n\nPatient: I'd really appreciate that. I know it's a process, and I'm committed to putting in the effort.\n\nTherapist: Your dedication is evident, Amir, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Now, let's take a look at the agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to:\n\n1. Review your homework from the last session, including your progress with thought records, cognitive rehearsal, gratitude journal, and reminding yourself of your new core belief.\n2. Discuss any challenges or successes you experienced in implementing your new core belief and practicing CBT techniques in various situations.\n3. Explore any changes or patterns in your emotional state and depression symptoms.\n4. Introduce new CBT techniques or strategies based on your progress and needs, such as behavioral experiments or advanced cognitive restructuring.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything you'd like to add or prioritize?",
