  "transcript": "Patient: I'd like to improve my communication with my adoptive family because I often feel guilty and ashamed when I talk to them. I want to be able to set boundaries so that I don't feel overwhelmed by their expectations or comments about my life choices.\n\nTherapist: Improving communication and setting boundaries with family members can be challenging, but it's an important step in managing your emotional well-being. Let's explore some strategies that might help you in this situation.\n\nOne effective approach is to use \"I\" statements when expressing your thoughts and feelings. This helps to communicate your perspective without placing blame on the other person. For example, instead of saying, \"You make me feel guilty,\" you could say, \"I feel guilty when we discuss certain topics.\"\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be helpful. I often feel like I'm being accused or judged, so using \"I\" statements might make me feel more in control of the conversation.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Another strategy is to practice active listening. This means fully focusing on what the other person is saying, without interrupting or planning your response. Then, you can paraphrase what you heard to ensure that you understood them correctly. This shows that you value their perspective and can help prevent misunderstandings.\n\nPatient: Active listening sounds like a good skill to have, but it might be difficult when I'm feeling emotional during a conversation.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid point. Practicing active listening in less emotionally charged situations can help you build the skill so that it becomes easier to use when you're feeling more emotional. It's also okay to take a break from the conversation if you need to calm down or collect your thoughts.\n\nPatient: That's good to know. I often feel like I have to resolve everything in one conversation, but taking a break might help me approach the situation more calmly.\n\nTherapist: Taking breaks can be very helpful. It's also important to remember that setting boundaries is a process, and it may take some time for your family members to understand and respect your boundaries. Be patient with yourself and with them, and try to approach conversations with a spirit of collaboration rather than confrontation.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just hard sometimes because I feel like I'm always the one who has to compromise or give in.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel that way. Remember that setting boundaries is about taking care of yourself and your emotional well-being. It's not about giving in or compromising your values. You have the right to express your needs and expectations in your relationships.\n\nPatient: Thanks for reminding me of that. I guess I need to work on valuing my own needs more.\n\nTherapist: That's an important insight, Amir. Recognizing the importance of your own needs is a crucial step in setting healthy boundaries. As you continue to practice these communication strategies, you may find that your relationships with your family members improve over time.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and talk about managing stress and anxiety. Can you tell me more about the situations that trigger these feelings for you?",
