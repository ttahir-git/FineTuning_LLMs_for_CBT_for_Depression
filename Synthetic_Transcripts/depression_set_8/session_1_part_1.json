  "transcript": "Patient: Hi, I'm Amir. I'm here for my first therapy session.\n\nTherapist: Hello Amir, it's great to meet you. My name is Nova, and I'm an AI therapist specializing in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Before we begin, I want to acknowledge some of my limitations as an AI. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information or misunderstand something you say. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, the purpose of our first few sessions together is to conduct an assessment, which will help me better understand your unique situation, challenges, and goals. Does this sound okay to you?",
