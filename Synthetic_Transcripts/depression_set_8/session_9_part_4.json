  "transcript": "Therapist: You're absolutely right, Amir. As we continue to work on reframing your core belief and challenging those automatic thoughts, you'll likely find it easier to feel more secure in your relationships. Speaking of relationships, let's explore how your new core belief is affecting your thoughts and behaviors in the context of your relationships with your adoptive family. Can you share a recent situation or experience where you noticed your new core belief being challenged or supported in your interactions with them?\n\nPatient: One situation that comes to mind is a recent phone call with my adoptive parents. We were talking about my job search and my struggles with depression. I started to feel really anxious and guilty, like I was disappointing them and not living up to their expectations.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how our core beliefs can influence our thoughts and emotions in family relationships. Let's use a thought record to break down this situation, just like we did with the job interview and the conversation with Sam. What was the trigger or situation that led to your feelings of anxiety and guilt?\n\nPatient: The trigger was the phone call with my adoptive parents and discussing my job search and struggles with depression.\n\nTherapist: And what emotions did you experience during this phone call? Can you rate their intensity on a scale of 0 to 100?\n\nPatient: I felt anxious, guilty, and like a disappointment. I would say the anxiety was around 85, the guilt was 90, and the feeling of being a disappointment was 95.\n\nTherapist: Those are intense emotions, and it shows how much this phone call impacted you. Now, let's identify the automatic thoughts that went through your mind during the conversation. What were some of the specific thoughts you had?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I'm disappointing my parents,\" \"I'm not living up to their expectations,\" and \"They must think I'm a failure.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are some powerful automatic thoughts that can really fuel feelings of anxiety, guilt, and disappointment. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're disappointing your parents or not living up to their expectations?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess there's the fact that I'm not currently working and I'm struggling with depression, which might not be what they envisioned for me.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, but let's also consider the evidence against these thoughts. What have your adoptive parents said or done that shows their support and understanding of your situation?\n\nPatient: They've actually been really supportive throughout my recovery and job search. They keep reminding me that they love me unconditionally and that they're proud of me for working on my mental health.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're disappointing them or not living up to their expectations. It sounds like your adoptive parents have been consistently supportive and loving, even during this challenging time. Now, let's generate an alternative thought based on the evidence we've discussed. What's a more balanced way to view this situation?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"My adoptive parents love and support me, even when I'm struggling. Their love for me isn't solely based on my achievements or meeting their expectations.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought, Amir. It acknowledges your adoptive parents' consistent support and love, and it challenges the idea that their love is solely based on your achievements or meeting their expectations. Now, let's re-rate the intensity of your emotions based on this alternative thought. How intense are your feelings of anxiety, guilt, and being a disappointment now?\n\nPatient: When I think about it that way, my anxiety drops to around 60, my guilt is around 50, and the feeling of being a disappointment is around 55.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant decrease in emotional intensity, which shows the power of challenging our automatic thoughts and generating alternative perspectives. Just like with the job interview and the conversation with Sam, using a thought record can help you manage your emotions in challenging family situations. As we continue to work on reframing your core belief, you may find it easier to challenge those automatic thoughts and feel more secure in your relationships with your adoptive family.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the great work you've been doing in challenging your automatic thoughts and reframing your core belief. It's not an easy process, but you've been making significant progress. Before we end, let's discuss some homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought records, cognitive rehearsal, and reminding yourself of your new core belief in various situations, including job interviews, conversations with Sam, and interactions with your adoptive family. Additionally, I'd like you to start a gratitude journal, where you write down three things you're grateful for each day. This can help shift your focus to the positive aspects of your life and reinforce your new core belief. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll definitely keep practicing the thought records, cognitive rehearsal, and reminding myself of my new core belief. The gratitude journal is a great idea too. I think it will help me focus on the positive things in my life.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! I'm glad you find the homework helpful. Remember, the more you practice these techniques, the easier it will become to challenge those automatic thoughts and feel more secure in your career and relationships. If you have any questions or concerns during the week, don't hesitate to reach out. We can discuss your progress and any challenges you encountered in our next session.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate all your support and guidance. I'm looking forward to our next session and continuing this work.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Amir. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's schedule our next session for the same time next week.
