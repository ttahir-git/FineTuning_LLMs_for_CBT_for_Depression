  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you again for our 8th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities, please remember that I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. If you ever feel that you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted person in your life. Lastly, since our interactions are text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like facial expressions or body language.\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. I'm here because I value the support and guidance you've provided me so far. Let's continue with the session.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for your understanding, Amir. I'm glad we can continue our work together. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: It's been a mixed week for me. I've been trying to practice the techniques we've discussed, like deep breathing and grounding exercises, and I do find them helpful in managing my anxiety. However, I've also had moments where I felt really low and struggled to motivate myself to do anything.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Amir. It's common to have ups and downs, and it's okay to acknowledge those difficult moments. Can you tell me more about what was going through your mind during those times when you felt low and unmotivated?\n\nPatient: I think it's a combination of things. Sometimes, I get stuck in negative thought patterns, like telling myself that I'm not good enough or that I'll never be able to have a successful career because of my past struggles. It's hard to shake off those thoughts, and they make me feel like giving up.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Amir. Those negative thoughts can be really powerful, and they often stem from deeper beliefs we hold about ourselves. In our previous sessions, we've started to explore some of your core beliefs, like the idea that you're a burden to your adoptive family. Today, I'd like to delve deeper into those beliefs and work on reframing them in a more balanced way. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: It sounds challenging, but I know it's something I need to work on. I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Amir. Before we dive in, let's set an agenda for today's session. We can start by reviewing your homework and discussing any challenges or successes you experienced with the techniques we've been practicing. Then, we'll focus on identifying and reframing some of your core beliefs. We'll also explore how these beliefs might be connected to your thoughts and feelings about your career and relationships. Does that sound like a good plan to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think it covers the main areas I've been struggling with. I don't have anything else to add right now.",
