  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great insights today, Amir. I want to encourage you to keep practicing these skills, both in your job search and in your relationships. Remember, challenging those negative thoughts and beliefs is a process, and it takes time. But every small step you take is a step towards a more balanced and healthy mindset.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I'll keep trying. It's good to know that I'm on the right track, even if it doesn't always feel like it.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And remember, you don't have to do this alone. You have support, both in our sessions and in your personal life. Speaking of which, how are you feeling about reaching out to your sister this week?\n\nPatient: I'm still a little nervous, but I feel a bit more prepared now. I think I'll try to call her tomorrow, just to check in and see how she's doing.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. And remember, you don't have to have a heavy conversation right away. Just focus on reconnecting and being present in the moment with her. You can always bring up any challenges or insights from that conversation in our next session.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll try to keep that in mind. I tend to put a lot of pressure on myself for these conversations to go perfectly.\n\nTherapist: That's a common tendency, but it's not very realistic or fair to yourself. Conversations, like relationships, are messy and imperfect. And that's okay. The important thing is that you're making an effort to connect and be honest about how you're feeling.\n\nPatient: You're right. I need to give myself permission to be imperfect.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And that's something we'll continue to work on together. Before we wrap up, let's review your homework for this week. In addition to continuing with the thought records and behavioral activation activities, I'd like you to start a Positive Data Log for evidence that supports your new core belief. And of course, I encourage you to have that conversation with your sister, and to practice cognitive restructuring during your job search. Does that sound manageable?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think so. It's a lot to work on, but I feel like I have a clearer sense of what I need to do now.\n\nTherapist: That's great. And remember, we'll keep working on these skills together in our sessions. You don't have to master them all at once. Every small step you take is progress.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Before we end, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now, after our session today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful, I think. It's still hard, but I feel like I have some tools to work with now.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. I'm so glad you're feeling more hopeful. Remember, hope is a powerful thing. It can give us the strength to keep going, even when things are tough. And you have a lot of strength, Amir. I see it in you, even when you don't see it in yourself.\n\nPatient: Thank you, that means a lot to me.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome. And remember, you can always reach out if you need support between sessions. I'm here for you. Until next time, take care of yourself, okay?\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you, Nova.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Amir's experience with thought records and behavioral activation activities since the last session.\n  - Discussed Amir's feelings of guilt and anxiety related to their relationship with their adoptive family, particularly their sister.\n  - Explored how Amir's old core belief of \"I'm worthless and unlovable\" and intermediate belief of \"I must earn love and support through success and meeting others' expectations\" may be influencing their assumptions about their family's perspective.\n  - Introduced the Positive Data Log technique to gather evidence supporting Amir's new core belief of \"I have intrinsic worth and am lovable, even when I'm struggling or make mistakes.\"\n  - Practiced cognitive restructuring to challenge negative thoughts related to Amir's job search and qualifications.\n  - Encouraged Amir to have an open and honest conversation with their sister to start testing their assumptions about their family's perspective.\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (continued from previous sessions): Practiced identifying automatic thoughts, emotions, and triggers in specific situations related to job search and feelings of worthlessness.
