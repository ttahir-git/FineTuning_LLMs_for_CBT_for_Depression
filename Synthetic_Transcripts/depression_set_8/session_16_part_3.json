  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's shift our focus to your job search, as you mentioned that's been a significant source of stress for you. Can you tell me more about what specific aspects of the job search process have been challenging?\n\nPatient: It's just overwhelming. I look at job postings and I feel like I'm not qualified for anything, even though I have a doctoral degree. I start thinking that I'm never going to find a job, and that I'm just going to be a burden on Sam forever.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound very familiar. It seems like your old core belief of \"I'm worthless and unlovable\" might be creeping in here. Let's try to break this down a bit. When you look at a job posting, what specific thoughts go through your mind?\n\nPatient: I see the list of qualifications and I immediately think \"I can't do that\" or \"They would never hire me.\" It's like I'm disqualified before I even apply.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you have these automatic thoughts that you're not qualified or hirable. Let's examine that a bit. What evidence do you have that you're not qualified for these jobs?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been out of work for a while, and I have gaps in my resume from when I was struggling with addiction. I feel like employers will see that and immediately write me off.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, but I want to challenge you a bit here. Is it possible that you're overlooking some of your qualifications? You mentioned you have a doctoral degree, which is a significant accomplishment. Have you considered that?\n\nPatient: I guess that's true. I worked really hard for my degree, and I do have skills and knowledge in my field. But I still feel like it's not enough.\n\nTherapist: That feeling of \"not enough\" is a common one, but it's not always based in reality. Let's try a cognitive restructuring exercise here. When you have the thought \"I'm not qualified for this job,\" what's an alternative thought you could have that's more balanced and based on evidence?\n\nPatient: I could think \"I have a doctoral degree and relevant skills, which could make me a strong candidate for this job, even with gaps in my employment history.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent! That's a much more balanced and evidence-based thought. How does it feel to reframe it that way?\n\nPatient: It feels a little better. I still have doubts, but it makes me feel like maybe I have a chance.\n\nTherapist: That's great. And that's the power of cognitive restructuring - it helps us challenge those automatic negative thoughts and see things in a more realistic light. As you continue with your job search, I encourage you to practice this skill. When you notice those negative thoughts creeping in, pause and try to reframe them in a more balanced way.\n\nPatient: I'll try. It's not easy, but I see how it could help.\n\nTherapist: It definitely takes practice, but the more you do it, the more natural it will start to feel. And remember, you can always bring up specific thoughts or situations in our sessions, and we can work through them together.\n\nPatient: Thanks, I appreciate that. I think I'm starting to see how all these techniques can work together to help me manage my depression.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. It's all about building that toolbox of skills you can use to challenge negative thoughts, engage in meaningful activities, and ultimately start to shift those deeper core beliefs. And you're doing a great job so far. I'm really proud of the progress you're making.\n\nPatient: Thank you. It's hard work, but I'm starting to feel a little more hopeful.",
