  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you again for our third session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm feeling a bit better today, but I'm still struggling with feelings of guilt and shame related to my addiction and the impact it's had on my relationships with my adoptive family.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling a bit better, Amir. I want to commend you for your openness and willingness to work through these challenging emotions. Before we continue, let's set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review your homework from the previous session, finalize our CBT conceptualization of your depression, and begin setting specific, measurable goals for your therapy. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me, Nova. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's begin by reviewing your homework. Can you share with me some of the cognitive distortions related to guilt and shame that you noticed in your thought monitoring and journaling over the past week?",
