  "transcript": "Patient: I found the thought records helpful, but it was challenging to do them consistently every day. Some days I just didn't feel up to it, or I would forget until the end of the day.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge when starting out with thought records. It's okay if you weren't able to do them every day. The important thing is that you're making an effort and building the habit. Did you notice any patterns or insights when you were able to complete the thought records?\n\nPatient: I noticed that a lot of my negative thoughts revolve around feeling like I'm not good enough, especially when it comes to my job search. I have a hard time believing that I'm qualified for any positions, even though I have a doctoral degree.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. It seems like there might be a connection between your automatic thoughts and some deeper beliefs about yourself. In our previous sessions, we've identified your old core belief as \"I'm worthless and unlovable.\" Do you think this belief could be influencing your thoughts about your job qualifications?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think so. It's hard to shake that feeling of worthlessness, even though I know logically that I have accomplishments and qualifications.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. Core beliefs can be very persistent, even in the face of contradictory evidence. One technique we can use to start reframing that core belief is called a Positive Data Log. This involves actively looking for and recording evidence that supports a more balanced and adaptive core belief, such as \"I have intrinsic worth and am lovable, even when I'm struggling or make mistakes.\" What do you think about trying that?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It might help me start to see myself in a more positive light.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's add that to your homework for this week. In addition to continuing with the thought records and behavioral activation activities, I'd like you to start a Positive Data Log. Whenever you notice something that supports your new core belief, jot it down. It could be a compliment from someone, a small accomplishment, or even just a moment when you felt good about yourself. The goal is to start building up evidence for this new, more balanced belief.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll give it a try. I think it might be helpful to have something concrete to look back on when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. It can be a powerful tool for challenging those deeply held negative beliefs. And remember, it's okay if you don't have something to add to the log every day. The important thing is to start looking for that evidence and giving it the weight it deserves.\n\nPatient: Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about your relationship with your adoptive family. You mentioned feeling guilty about not talking to them much since starting therapy. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nPatient: Well, I know they care about me, but I've always felt like I'm a disappointment to them. They were so supportive when I was in college and getting my degree, but I feel like I've let them down by struggling with addiction and being unemployed now.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like there might be some assumptions there about how your family sees you. Have you had conversations with them about how you're feeling?\n\nPatient: Not really. I've been avoiding talking to them because I don't want to disappoint them even more.\n\nTherapist: I understand that fear, but it's possible that your family might be more understanding than you think. One of the intermediate beliefs we've identified is \"I must earn love and support through success and meeting others' expectations.\" Do you think that belief could be influencing your assumptions about your family's perspective?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think it is. I've always felt like I have to be perfect to be worthy of their love and support.\n\nTherapist: That's a common belief, but it's not a very realistic or healthy one. People's worth isn't determined by their accomplishments or ability to meet expectations. It's possible that your family loves and supports you simply because you're you, not because of what you have or haven't achieved.\n\nPatient: I guess that's possible, but it's hard to believe.\n\nTherapist: I know it's hard. These beliefs can be very deeply ingrained. But one way to start testing that belief is to have an open and honest conversation with your family about how you're feeling. You might be surprised by their response.\n\nPatient: I'm a little scared to do that, but I know I need to. I don't want to keep avoiding them.\n\nTherapist: It's okay to be scared. That's a normal feeling when we're facing something that feels vulnerable. But I encourage you to try. You can even start small, maybe with just one family member you feel closest to. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I think I could try talking to my sister. We've always been pretty close, and I think she might understand.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great place to start. And remember, you don't have to have the whole conversation at once. You can take it slow and just focus on being honest about how you're feeling and why you've been distant.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll try to talk to her this week.\n\nTherapist: Great. And remember, you can always bring up any challenges or insights from that conversation in our next session. I'm here to support you through this process.\n\nPatient: Thanks, I appreciate that.",
