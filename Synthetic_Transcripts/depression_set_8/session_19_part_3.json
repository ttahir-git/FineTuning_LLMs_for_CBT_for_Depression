  "transcript": "Patient: When my depression symptoms start to worsen, I notice that I have more negative thoughts about myself and my future. I might think things like \"I'll never be happy\" or \"I'm a burden to others.\" I also tend to lose motivation and energy for activities I usually enjoy, like going for walks or working on projects. My sleep patterns can change too - I might have trouble falling asleep or want to sleep all the time.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of early warning signs, Amir. Recognizing these signs is an important part of relapse prevention because it allows you to take action early on, before your symptoms worsen further. \n\nLet's discuss some strategies you can use when you notice these early warning signs. One effective strategy is to review your thought records and coping cards. Reminding yourself of the alternative, more balanced thoughts you've developed can help counteract the negative thoughts that may be resurfacing.\n\nAnother strategy is to prioritize self-care activities, even if you don't feel motivated. Engaging in activities that usually bring you joy, relaxation, or a sense of accomplishment can help boost your mood and energy. It's also important to reach out for support when you're struggling. This could mean talking to a trusted friend or family member, attending a support group, or scheduling a \"booster\" therapy session.\n\nWhat do you think about these strategies? Do you have any other ideas for managing early warning signs?\n\nPatient: Those strategies make sense to me. Reviewing my thought records and coping cards could help me challenge the negative thoughts that creep up. And even though it's hard to motivate myself when I'm feeling down, I know that engaging in self-care activities usually helps me feel a bit better.\n\nI also like the idea of reaching out for support. Sometimes I hesitate to do that because I don't want to burden others, but I know that my partner and close friends are always there for me. Maybe I could also look into joining a support group for people with depression. It could be helpful to connect with others who understand what I'm going through.\n\nTherapist: Those are great ideas, Amir. Challenging negative thoughts, engaging in self-care, and seeking support are all powerful tools for managing early warning signs of depression. I especially like your idea of joining a support group. Connecting with others who have similar experiences can provide a sense of validation, understanding, and community.\n\nAnother important aspect of relapse prevention is creating a \"wellness action plan.\" This is a written plan that outlines specific steps you can take if your depression symptoms start to worsen. The plan might include things like:\n\n- Reviewing your thought records and coping cards daily\n- Scheduling at least one self-care activity per day\n- Reaching out to a specific support person (e.g., partner, friend, therapist) \n- Attending a support group meeting\n- Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation\n- Engaging in physical activity, such as going for a walk or doing a gentle yoga routine\n\nThe key is to have a concrete plan in place so that you don't have to think too hard about what to do when you're feeling overwhelmed. Having a written plan can provide guidance and structure during difficult times.\n\nWhat do you think about creating a wellness action plan? What specific steps would you include in your plan?",
