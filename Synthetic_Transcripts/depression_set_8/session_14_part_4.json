Before we wrap up today's session, let's discuss your homework for the week. In addition to reaching out to your professor and continuing with the thought records and behavioral activation activities, I'd like you to start a gratitude journal. Each day, write down three things you're grateful for, no matter how small they may seem. This practice can help shift your focus from negative thoughts to positive aspects of your life. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's a good way to remind myself of the positive things in my life, even when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Practicing gratitude can be a powerful tool in challenging negative beliefs and improving overall well-being. Remember, the goal is to find a balance between acknowledging your struggles and recognizing the good in your life.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely give it a try. Thank you for all your help and support, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Amir. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Before we end today's session, let's take a moment to check in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better than when we started. Talking through my concerns and making a plan always helps. I know I still have work to do, but I feel more hopeful about the future.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Amir. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are a normal part of the process. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you continue this work. If you ever find yourself struggling between sessions, don't hesitate to reach out for support. You have a strong network of people who care about you and want to see you succeed.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate the reminder. I'll do my best to reach out when I need help.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Amir. I'm confident that with continued practice and support, you'll see a significant improvement in your well-being. Let's plan to meet again next week to discuss your progress and any challenges you encounter with the homework and experiments. In the meantime, take care of yourself and remember to celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you again, Nova. I'll see you next week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Amir's experience with thought records and behavioral activation activities since the last session.\n  - Explored Amir's concerns and negative beliefs related to reaching out to their former professor for job search support.\n  - Introduced cognitive and behavioral experiments to test the validity of Amir's beliefs and gather evidence to challenge them.\n  - Discussed the importance of finding a balance between challenging oneself and not overwhelming oneself in experiments.\n  - Emphasized the importance of separating self-worth from achievements and outcomes.\n  - Explored potential outcomes of the experiment with the professor and planned coping strategies.\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (continued from previous sessions): Practiced identifying automatic thoughts, emotions, and triggers in specific situations related to job search and feelings of worthlessness.
