  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you again for session 7. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been practicing the distress tolerance techniques we discussed, and they've been helpful in managing my anxiety. I've also been trying to engage in more activities, like reading and going for walks, but I still struggle with motivation at times. My mood has been relatively stable, but I still have moments where I feel guilty and ashamed about my past struggles with addiction and the impact it's had on my family.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the distress tolerance techniques have been helpful for you, Amir. It's also great that you've been making an effort to engage in activities, even if motivation is still a challenge at times. Regarding the feelings of guilt and shame, those are understandable given your experiences, but it's important that we continue to work on challenging those negative thoughts and beliefs. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my relationship with my adoptive family and the guilt I feel around that. It's been weighing on me heavily lately. I'd also like to discuss some of the challenges I've been facing with motivation and engaging in activities.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan, Amir. We can start by exploring your thoughts and beliefs related to your adoptive family and work on challenging any negative or distorted thinking patterns. Then, we can discuss strategies for improving motivation and engagement in activities. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds great, Nova. I'm ready to dive in.",
