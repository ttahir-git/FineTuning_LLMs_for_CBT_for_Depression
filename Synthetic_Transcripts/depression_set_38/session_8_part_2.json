  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for CBT session 8 with Dr. Alejandro Torres:\n\nPatient: I've been trying to practice the thought challenging technique, but it's been difficult. I find myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns, especially around my worth and identity as a musician. It's hard to break out of that cycle.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it can be challenging to challenge long-standing negative thoughts, especially when they're tied to something as important to you as your musical identity. Can you share an example of a negative thought you've been struggling with recently?\n\nPatient: Well, I often think to myself, \"I'm no longer a real musician because of my Parkinson's diagnosis. I can't play like I used to, so what's the point of even trying?\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alejandro. That thought seems to be causing you a lot of distress. Let's examine it more closely using a thought record. First, can you identify the emotions that come up when you have that thought, and rate their intensity on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: When I have that thought, I feel sad, hopeless, and worthless. I'd say the sadness is around an 80, the hopelessness is a 90, and the worthlessness is a 95.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write those down in the emotions column. Now, in the evidence for column, what evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I can't play my instruments like I used to. My fingers don't move as quickly, and I struggle with tremors. I can't compose music as easily because of the physical limitations. It's like a part of me has been taken away.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, and I know that must be incredibly difficult. Let's also look at the evidence against this thought. What would you say to a friend or colleague who expressed a similar thought about themselves?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that their worth as a musician isn't solely defined by their technical abilities. I'd remind them of their years of experience, knowledge, and the joy they've brought to others through their music.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alejandro. Now, can you try to apply that same compassion and perspective to your own situation? What's an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence against your initial negative thought?\n\nPatient: I guess an alternative thought could be, \"Even though my physical abilities have changed, I'm still a musician at heart. My years of experience and knowledge are still valuable, and I can find new ways to express myself musically.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful alternative thought, Alejandro. It acknowledges the reality of your situation while also recognizing your inherent worth and potential for growth. Now, let's re-rate your emotions based on this new thought. How intense are the feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness now?\n\nPatient: The sadness is still there, but maybe more like a 50 now. The hopelessness has gone down to a 60, and the worthlessness is around a 70.\n\nTherapist: That's progress, Alejandro. By challenging that negative thought and coming up with a more balanced alternative, you've been able to reduce the intensity of those painful emotions. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the easier it will become.",
