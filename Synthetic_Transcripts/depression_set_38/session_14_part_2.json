  "transcript": "Patient: I've been struggling with completing the thought records. I find it difficult to identify the evidence against my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Dr. Torres. Let's take a closer look at one of the thought records you completed. Can you share an example of a negative thought you struggled to find evidence against?\n\nPatient: Sure. I had the thought, \"I'm worthless without my musical abilities.\" I couldn't think of any evidence against that thought.\n\nTherapist: I understand how that thought can feel very powerful and all-consuming. Let's break it down together. When you say, \"I'm worthless without my musical abilities,\" what does \"worthless\" mean to you in this context?\n\nPatient: It means that I have no value, that I'm not contributing anything meaningful to the world.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so the underlying belief is that your value is tied to your musical abilities and contributions. Now, let's consider this: are there other aspects of yourself or your life that hold value, outside of your musical abilities?\n\nPatient: I suppose my relationships with my children and grandchildren hold value. And I've always tried to be a good person, to treat others with kindness and respect.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Those are significant aspects of your life that hold inherent value. Your role as a father and grandfather, the love and support you offer your family, and the way you treat others \u2013 these are all valuable contributions that have nothing to do with your musical abilities. How does considering this evidence affect the intensity of the initial thought, \"I'm worthless without my musical abilities\"?\n\nPatient: When I look at it that way, the thought doesn't feel as strong. I can see that there are other parts of my life that hold value.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Dr. Torres. By examining the evidence against the negative thought, we can start to reframe it in a more balanced way. Perhaps a more helpful thought might be, \"Even though my musical abilities have changed, I still have value in other areas of my life, such as my relationships and the way I treat others.\"\n\nPatient: Yes, that feels more balanced and less extreme.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that feels more helpful. As we continue practicing thought records, remember that finding evidence against negative thoughts can be challenging at first. Be patient with yourself and try to approach it with curiosity and self-compassion. With practice, it will become easier to identify evidence and reframe negative thoughts in a more balanced way.",
