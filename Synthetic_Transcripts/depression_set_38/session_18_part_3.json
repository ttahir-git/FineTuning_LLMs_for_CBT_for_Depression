  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made an important connection, Alejandro, between seeking support and continuing to make progress in managing your depression. Accessing support, whether from me, your support group, or loved ones, is a key part of maintaining your well-being after our sessions conclude. Speaking of which, I'd like us to start thinking about your plans for supporting yourself after our therapy ends. While you've made significant strides, it's essential to have a plan in place to maintain your progress. What thoughts do you have about how you can continue to support yourself going forward?\n\nPatient: I know I need to keep practicing the skills I've learned, like challenging my negative thoughts and using the coping strategies we've discussed. I think continuing to attend my Parkinson's support group will be helpful, too. But I'm a little worried about not having this regular check-in with you.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel some apprehension about ending therapy. That's why we'll work together to create a comprehensive plan for maintaining your gains and managing any challenges that may arise. One helpful tool is creating coping cards, which are personalized reminders of the adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs you've developed. These can be a great resource to turn to when you need a boost. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: I like the sound of that. It would be good to have something tangible to remind me of what I've learned and the progress I've made.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. We can spend some time in our remaining sessions creating those coping cards together. Another important aspect of your support plan is identifying early warning signs of depression and having a clear plan for how to respond if you notice those signs. This might include reaching out to your support system, engaging in self-care activities, or even scheduling a booster session with me if needed. What early warning signs have you noticed in the past that we should include in your plan?\n\nPatient: I think one early warning sign for me is when I start isolating myself and avoiding things I usually enjoy, like attending mass or calling my friends. Another sign is when I have trouble sleeping or my appetite changes.\n\nTherapist: Those are great insights, Alejandro. We can definitely include those in your wellness action plan, along with specific steps you can take if you notice those signs, like reaching out to a friend or engaging in a self-care activity you enjoy. Remember, having a plan in place doesn't mean you've failed or that your progress isn't real. It's simply a way to be proactive about your well-being and ensure you have the tools you need to maintain your gains.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just worry that I'll slip back into old patterns after therapy ends.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's something we can address together. In addition to your coping cards and wellness action plan, another helpful exercise is completing meta-thought records about the experience of ending therapy. This involves examining any thoughts or concerns you have about concluding our sessions, like the worry you just mentioned, and challenging any distortions or unrealistic expectations. This can help you feel more prepared and confident as we approach the end of our work together. Would you be willing to try a meta-thought record now?\n\nPatient: Sure, I'm open to trying it. I've found the thought records helpful in other situations, so it makes sense to use them for this, too.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's start with the thought you just shared, \"I worry that I'll slip back into old patterns after therapy ends.\" What emotions do you feel when you have that thought?\n\nPatient: I feel anxious and a bit hopeless, like all the progress I've made might be undone.\n\nTherapist: I understand why that thought would lead to those emotions. Now, let's look for evidence that supports or refutes that thought. What evidence do you have that you'll slip back into old patterns?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess there's no guarantee that I won't struggle again in the future. But I don't have any concrete evidence that I will.\n\nTherapist: That's an important distinction. Now, what evidence do you have that counters that thought?\n\nPatient: I've learned a lot of new skills and strategies in therapy, and I've been able to use them to manage my depression better than before. And I know I have support from my group and my loved ones.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. So, based on the evidence, what would be a more balanced thought?\n\nPatient: \"While there's no guarantee I won't face challenges in the future, I have new skills and support to help me maintain my progress and cope with any setbacks.\"\n\nTherapist: I think that's a much more balanced and hopeful thought, and it's based on the evidence you have. How do you feel when you consider that thought?\n\nPatient: I feel less anxious and more confident in my ability to handle whatever comes my way.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Alejandro. This is a perfect example of how challenging our thoughts can lead to a shift in our emotions, even when it comes to concerns about ending therapy. It's a skill you can continue to use anytime you feel worried or uncertain.",
