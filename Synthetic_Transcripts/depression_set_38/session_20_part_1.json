  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a crisis situation, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted friend or family member. Finally, since our interactions are text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and feelings openly through your words. With that said, let's start by checking in on how you've been doing since our last session. How have you been feeling, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. I've had some good days where I felt motivated to work on my music and engage with others, but I've also had days where I struggled with feelings of worthlessness and sadness. I tried to use the thought records and coping cards when I noticed those negative thoughts creeping in, and I think they helped to some extent. I also watched the music notation software tutorial, which was both exciting and overwhelming. It brought up a lot of emotions about my changing relationship with music.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've had some good days and that you've been using the thought records and coping cards to manage the more challenging moments. It's also completely understandable that watching the music notation software tutorial brought up a mix of emotions. Change can be exciting, but it can also be overwhelming, especially when it involves something as meaningful to you as music. I'm curious to explore those emotions further with you today. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for our session. In addition to discussing your experience with the music notation software, I'd also like to review your wellness action plan and see if there are any updates or additions you'd like to make based on your experiences over the past week. We can also continue our work on challenging negative thoughts and exploring your feelings of worthlessness. Does that sound good to you, or is there anything else you'd like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think it's important to discuss my experience with the music notation software and the emotions it brought up. I'd also like to review my wellness action plan and see if there are any changes I should make. I'm still struggling with feelings of worthlessness, so I think it would be helpful to continue working on challenging those negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by discussing your experience with the music notation software. Can you tell me more about the emotions that came up for you while watching the tutorial? What thoughts were going through your mind?",
