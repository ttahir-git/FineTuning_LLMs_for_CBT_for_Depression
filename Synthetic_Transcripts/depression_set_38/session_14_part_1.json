  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Dr. Torres, it's good to see you again for our 14th session. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a crisis situation, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted individual in your life. Lastly, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so I encourage you to express your thoughts and feelings as openly as possible. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for the reminder.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. Now, let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week. I've been struggling with feelings of worthlessness and grief over the loss of my musical abilities. I attended the Parkinson's support group meeting, but I found it difficult to engage with others.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Dr. Torres. It takes courage to acknowledge and share these struggles. Let's make sure to prioritize discussing your feelings of worthlessness and your experience with the support group during today's session. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I also wanted to discuss some thoughts I had while completing the thought records you assigned as homework.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely review your thought records and explore the thoughts that came up for you. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main points.\n\nTherapist: Alright, so our agenda for today includes:\n1. Discussing your feelings of worthlessness and grief related to the loss of your musical abilities\n2. Reviewing your experience with the Parkinson's support group and challenges in engaging with others\n3. Reviewing the thought records you completed as homework and exploring the thoughts that arose\n\nBefore we dive in, how are you feeling about this agenda? Is there anything you'd like to add or modify?",
