  "transcript": "Patient: Breaking it down into smaller steps makes it feel more manageable. I'll commit to watching an introductory tutorial for one of the music notation software options before our next session.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Alejandro. Breaking tasks down into smaller, achievable steps can make them feel less overwhelming and increase the likelihood of success. I'm glad you're willing to take this first step towards exploring new ways to engage with your passion for music.\n\nAs you watch the tutorial, pay attention to any thoughts or emotions that come up for you. If you notice any negative thoughts or self-critical beliefs, try to challenge them using the skills we've been practicing, like thought records and coping cards.\n\nSpeaking of coping cards, you mentioned earlier that you created a card reminding yourself that your worth is not defined by your musical abilities. How have you been using that card since our last session?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to read it every morning when I wake up, to start my day with a more positive mindset. It's helpful to have that reminder, but I'm still working on fully believing it.\n\nTherapist: Using the coping card as part of your morning routine is a great way to set a positive tone for the day. It's normal for it to take time to fully internalize new beliefs, especially when they challenge long-held core beliefs about yourself.\n\nAs you continue to use the coping cards, try to pair them with experiences that provide evidence for the new beliefs. For example, when you have moments where you feel valued or accomplished in areas outside of music, take note of those experiences and use them to reinforce the message on your coping card.\n\nAnother way to strengthen your belief in your inherent worth is to practice self-compassion. When you notice yourself being self-critical or focusing on your perceived limitations, try to respond with kindness and understanding, as you would to a dear friend going through a difficult time.\n\nLet's practice that now. Can you think of a recent situation where you were hard on yourself? How could you respond to yourself with self-compassion instead?\n\nPatient: Last week, I struggled to play a piece on the piano that used to come easily to me. I got frustrated and started thinking, \"I'm a failure as a musician.\" With self-compassion, I could acknowledge that it's understandable to feel frustrated when facing new challenges and that my value as a person isn't tied to my ability to play that specific piece.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example of applying self-compassion, Alejandro. You recognized the difficulty of the situation and responded with understanding and kindness towards yourself. This practice can help shift your focus from self-criticism to self-acceptance and support.\n\nAs we continue to work on building self-compassion and challenging negative beliefs about your worth, remember that it's a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Celebrate the small victories along the way, like using your coping cards or responding to yourself with kindness in a difficult moment.\n\nNow, let's shift gears and discuss your plan for maintaining progress after our therapy sessions end. We've started to develop a wellness action plan, which outlines steps you can take to support your mental health going forward. Let's review what we've included so far and add any new strategies or resources that could be helpful.\n\nWhat are some key elements you'd like to include in your wellness action plan?",
