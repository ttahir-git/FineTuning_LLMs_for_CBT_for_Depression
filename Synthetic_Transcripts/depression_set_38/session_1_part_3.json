  "transcript": "Patient: Thank you, Nova. It's comforting to know that what I'm experiencing is not uncommon and that there's hope for improvement.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Alejandro. There is always hope, and you've already taken a significant step by reaching out for help. I'm curious about the coping mechanisms you've been using to manage your depression. You mentioned that you've tried to continue playing music, but it often leads to frustration. Are there any other strategies you've employed to cope with your emotions?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to write in a journal, expressing my thoughts and feelings. It helps sometimes, but other times it feels like I'm just going in circles with my thoughts. I also pray and attend mass regularly, which brings me some sense of peace and connection to my faith.\n\nTherapist: Journaling and engaging with your faith can be powerful coping tools. They provide outlets for processing emotions and finding solace. However, it's essential to recognize when these strategies may not be enough to alleviate the intensity of depressive symptoms. Have you ever sought professional help for your depression before?\n\nPatient: No, this is my first time seeking therapy. I've always been a private person, and I thought I could handle it on my own. But my neurologist encouraged me to try therapy, and I'm starting to realize that I need more support than I initially thought.\n\nTherapist: It takes courage to acknowledge when we need additional support, and I'm glad you've taken this step. In addition to professional help, having a strong social support system can be crucial in managing depression. You mentioned earlier that you've been isolating yourself more. Can you tell me about your current support network?\n\nPatient: I have a single parents support group that I joined after my divorce many years ago. They've been a great source of emotional support, but I haven't been as active in the group lately. I also have a few close friends, but I haven't reached out to them much recently. I don't want to burden them with my problems.\n\nTherapist: It's common for people experiencing depression to withdraw from their support systems, often due to feelings of guilt or not wanting to be a burden. However, connecting with others who care about you can be a vital part of your healing process. Your support group and close friends could provide a valuable network of understanding and encouragement.\n\nPatient: You're right, Nova. I haven't been prioritizing those connections, but I know they would be there for me if I reached out.\n\nTherapist: As we continue to work together, we can explore ways to help you reconnect with your support system and build new connections if needed. Based on what you've shared so far, I'm beginning to form a preliminary understanding of your situation. It seems that your depression is closely tied to the significant losses you've experienced \u2013 your career, your musical abilities, and a sense of purpose. These losses have led to feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and disconnection from activities and people you once enjoyed.\n\nPatient: Yes, that sums it up well. It's like I'm grieving the life I once had, and I don't know how to move forward.",
