  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying to do the thought records and positive data log, but it's been tough. Some days, I just don't feel like I have any evidence to support the belief that I'm resilient.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it can be challenging to find evidence for your resilience, especially when you're feeling down. Let's take a closer look at your positive data log. Can you share an entry where you struggled to find evidence?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last Wednesday, I stayed in bed most of the day because I just couldn't find the motivation to get up. I didn't see how that could be evidence of resilience.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Liam. I can see how it might be difficult to view that day as evidence of resilience. However, even on days when you stay in bed, there are likely small moments where you're still taking care of yourself, like eating a meal or responding to a text from a friend. These small actions, even in the face of depression, are evidence of your resilience. Remember, resilience isn't about being perfect or always feeling motivated; it's about persevering through challenges, even in small ways.\n\nPatient: I guess I never thought about it that way. I was focusing on the fact that I stayed in bed, but you're right, I did get up to eat and I responded to a few messages from friends.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Those actions, however small they may seem, are evidence of your resilience. Let's try to reframe that entry in your positive data log to acknowledge those moments of self-care and connection with friends. How could you rewrite it to highlight your resilience?\n\nPatient: I could write something like, \"Even though I stayed in bed most of the day, I still managed to get up and eat a meal. I also responded to messages from friends, showing that I'm still able to maintain connections even when I'm feeling down.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great way to reframe it, Liam. By focusing on those small actions, you're building evidence for your resilience. As we continue with the positive data log, try to keep this perspective in mind. Even on tough days, there are likely moments, however small, that demonstrate your ability to cope with challenges.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just hard sometimes, because my mind automatically goes to the negative.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, and it's something we can continue to work on together. Our thoughts often have a negativity bias, which means we tend to focus more on negative experiences than positive ones. By consciously looking for evidence of your resilience, even in small moments, you're training your mind to recognize and appreciate your strengths.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess it's just going to take some practice.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's what we're here for. As you continue with the positive data log, remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself. Building new beliefs takes time and practice, but I'm confident that you can do it.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your support and encouragement.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Liam. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Now, let's take a look at your thought records. Is there a particular entry you'd like to discuss?",
