  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Liam, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing alright. I've been practicing the \"I\" statements and coping statements we discussed, especially with the holidays coming up. It's been helpful, but I'm still feeling anxious about seeing my family.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've worked on. I understand that the upcoming family gatherings can be a source of anxiety for you. Let's explore that a bit more. Can you tell me what specific thoughts or concerns are contributing to your anxiety?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm worried that I'll be judged for not having a job yet, and that my family will be disappointed in me. I know we've talked about challenging these thoughts, but it's hard not to let them get to me.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's understandable that you're feeling anxious about it. Let's take a moment to examine those thoughts using the CBT triangle. Can you identify the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors associated with this situation?\n\nPatient: Well, the thoughts are that my family will judge me and be disappointed. The emotions are anxiety and maybe a bit of shame. And the behaviors... I guess I tend to withdraw and avoid talking about my job situation.\n\nTherapist: You're doing a great job identifying the different components of the CBT triangle. Now, let's focus on the thought that your family will judge you and be disappointed. Is there evidence to support this thought? Have there been times when your family has shown understanding or support?\n\nPatient: I suppose there have been times when they've been supportive. My mom, especially, has always been there for me. But I still can't shake the feeling that they'll be disappointed.\n\nTherapist: It's good that you're able to recognize the support from your mom. Let's explore that further. What would you say to a friend who expressed similar concerns about their family being disappointed in them?\n\nPatient: I'd probably tell them that their family loves them no matter what, and that they shouldn't be so hard on themselves.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Liam. It's often easier to show compassion to others than to ourselves. Let's try to apply that same compassion to your own situation. What would a more balanced thought look like?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be that my family loves me, and even if they have concerns, they ultimately want me to be happy and successful.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! That's a much more balanced and realistic perspective. As we continue our work together, we'll keep practicing challenging these negative thoughts and replacing them with more adaptive ones. Now, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?",
