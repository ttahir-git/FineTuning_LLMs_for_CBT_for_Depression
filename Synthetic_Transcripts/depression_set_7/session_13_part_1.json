  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Liam, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you need immediate support, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today, and what would you like to focus on in our session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like cognitive restructuring and the worry time. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I've noticed that I'm starting to catch myself when I have negative thoughts and try to reframe them. However, I'm still struggling with feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt, especially when it comes to my job search and relationships.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we've discussed. It's great that you're starting to catch and reframe negative thoughts. It's also completely normal to still struggle with feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt, especially in areas that are important to you, like your job search and relationships. These feelings often stem from deeply held core beliefs that take time to change. Today, I'd like to focus on exploring these feelings further and continuing to work on reframing negative thoughts. We can also discuss any challenges you've faced with the techniques we've covered so far. What do you think about that plan?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think exploring these feelings more and continuing to work on reframing negative thoughts would be really helpful. I've also been having some trouble with the worry time technique. I find it hard to set aside a specific time to worry and then postpone worries outside of that time.\n\nTherapist: I understand that the worry time technique can be challenging to implement at first. It's a skill that takes practice. Today, we can review the steps of the technique and troubleshoot any difficulties you've been having. We can also discuss some additional strategies for managing worry and rumination. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That would be great. I'm open to any strategies that can help me manage my worry and rumination.\n\nTherapist: Alright, so for our agenda today, we'll:\n1. Explore the feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt that you've been experiencing, particularly in relation to your job search and relationships.\n2. Continue working on reframing negative thoughts using cognitive restructuring techniques.\n3. Review the worry time technique and troubleshoot any difficulties you've been having.\n4. Discuss additional strategies for managing worry and rumination.\n\nDoes this agenda work for you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: That agenda covers everything I wanted to discuss today. I think it's a good plan.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by exploring the feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt that you mentioned. Can you tell me more about when these feelings come up for you and what thoughts accompany them?",
