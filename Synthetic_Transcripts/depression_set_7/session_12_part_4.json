  "transcript": "Therapist: You've been doing a great job engaging with the therapy process, Liam. I know it's not always easy, but your efforts are making a difference. Before we wrap up today's session, I'd like to introduce one more technique that can be helpful in managing depressive symptoms. It's called \"worry time.\"\n\nPatient: Worry time? What's that?\n\nTherapist: Worry time is a technique that involves setting aside a specific time each day to focus on your worries and concerns. During this designated time, you allow yourself to think about the things that are bothering you, but outside of that time, you try to postpone those thoughts until your next scheduled worry time.\n\nPatient: How does that help with depression?\n\nTherapist: Often, when we're dealing with depression, we can get caught up in negative thought cycles that feel overwhelming and uncontrollable. By setting aside a specific time to worry, we're taking back some control over those thoughts. It can help prevent the worries from spilling over into the rest of your day and interfering with your ability to engage in other activities.\n\nPatient: I can see how that might be helpful. How do I go about setting up a worry time?\n\nTherapist: First, choose a specific time each day that works for you. It could be 15-30 minutes, depending on your preference. Try to choose a time when you're less likely to be distracted or interrupted. During your worry time, allow yourself to focus on your concerns and write them down if it helps. Once the time is up, make a conscious effort to postpone any further worrying until your next scheduled worry time.\n\nPatient: What if I start worrying outside of my designated time?\n\nTherapist: That's bound to happen, especially at first. When you catch yourself worrying outside of your worry time, gently remind yourself that you'll have time to focus on those concerns later. You can even jot down a quick note to remember to think about it during your next worry time. Over time, it becomes easier to postpone the worries.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can give that a try.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, like all the techniques we've discussed, worry time takes practice. Be patient with yourself as you're learning to use this tool. I'd like to assign worry time as part of your homework for this week, in addition to continuing with your thought records, positive data log, and behavioral activation plan. Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?\n\nPatient: No, I think I've got it. It's a lot to remember, but I'll do my best.\n\nTherapist: You're doing an excellent job, Liam. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. What matters is that you keep showing up for yourself and engaging in the process. Before we end today's session, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also hopeful. It's a lot to take in, but I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Liam. Remember, you're not alone in this process. We're here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns between now and our next session, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you next week.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support. See you next week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed thought records and positive data log from previous homework\n  - Introduced worry time technique to manage depressive rumination\n  - Discussed the importance of self-compassion and patience in the therapy process\n  - Checked in on patient's current mood and any final thoughts\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Cognitive restructuring (thought records, downward arrow technique)\n  - Positive data log\n  - Behavioral activation plan\n  - Worry time\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue practicing cognitive restructuring techniques, including thought records and the downward arrow technique.
