  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I've been keeping up with my thought records. One situation that stood out to me was when I received a rejection email from a job I had applied to. My initial thoughts were along the lines of \"I knew I wasn't good enough for this job\" and \"I'll never find a job that suits me.\" The emotions I felt were disappointment, frustration, and a sense of hopelessness.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Liam. Those thoughts and emotions are completely understandable given the situation. Let's take a closer look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not good enough for the job?\n\nPatient: Well, the fact that I got rejected is pretty clear evidence, isn't it?\n\nTherapist: I can see how it might seem that way, but let's consider some alternative perspectives. Is it possible that there were other qualified candidates who happened to be a better fit for this particular position?\n\nPatient: I suppose that's possible. I don't know who else applied or what the hiring manager was specifically looking for.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Liam. The job market is competitive, and there are many factors that go into hiring decisions. One rejection doesn't necessarily mean you're not good enough. It could simply mean that there was someone else who was a better match for this specific role. What about evidence against the thought that you'll never find a suitable job?\n\nPatient: When I think about it rationally, I know I have skills and qualifications that make me a strong candidate. I've had success in my previous roles, and I've received positive feedback from colleagues and supervisors. It's just hard to remember that when I'm feeling down about a rejection.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent insight, Liam. It's common for negative thoughts to feel more salient in the moment, but it's important to consider the bigger picture. Based on the evidence you've just shared, how might you reframe your initial thoughts about the rejection?\n\nPatient: I could tell myself something like, \"This rejection doesn't define my worth or abilities. It's just one opportunity that didn't work out, but there will be others. I have valuable skills and experiences that will help me find the right job eventually.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic reframe, Liam! You've done a great job of challenging the cognitive distortions we discussed earlier, like personalization and fortune-telling. By focusing on the evidence and considering alternative perspectives, you've come up with a much more balanced and adaptive thought. How do you feel when you think about the situation from this new perspective?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit more hopeful and less discouraged. It's still disappointing, but I don't feel as stuck in the negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Liam. This is a great example of how thought records can help us reframe negative thoughts and shift our emotional state. As we continue practicing this skill, it will become easier to catch and challenge those automatic negative thoughts in the moment.",
