  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Liam, it's great to see you again for session 16. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've been providing me. Since our last session, I've been trying to keep up with the thought records and the behavioral experiment we discussed. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and overall outlook. I'm still struggling with insomnia and low energy levels, but I'm trying to push through.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've noticed some improvements, even if they're small. It's a positive sign that you're making progress. I understand that insomnia and low energy levels can be difficult to manage, and we can definitely explore some strategies to help with that. Let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my insomnia and see if we can come up with some strategies to improve my sleep. I also want to discuss my progress with the thought records and the behavioral experiment. And maybe we can explore some ways to boost my energy levels during the day.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Liam. We can definitely focus on insomnia, review your progress with the thought records and behavioral experiment, and discuss ways to increase your energy levels. Let's start with your insomnia. Can you tell me more about your current sleep patterns and any factors that might be contributing to your difficulty sleeping?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been having trouble falling asleep, and when I do finally drift off, I wake up frequently throughout the night. I think a lot of it has to do with my racing thoughts and the anxiety I feel about my job search and future in general. I've tried some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation, but they only seem to help a little.\n\nTherapist: It's common for racing thoughts and anxiety to interfere with sleep. The techniques you've tried are a great start, and we can build on those. One strategy that can be helpful is to create a consistent sleep schedule and routine. This means going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends. It's also important to create a relaxing bedtime routine that signals to your body and mind that it's time to wind down. This could include activities like reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing relaxation techniques. What do you think about trying to establish a consistent sleep schedule and bedtime routine?",
