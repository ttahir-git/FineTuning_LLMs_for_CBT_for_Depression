  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share an example from my thought records. A few days ago, I received a rejection email from a job I had applied to. My initial thoughts were, \"I knew I wouldn't get this job. I'm not qualified enough, and I'll never find a job in my field.\" I tried to come up with alternative thoughts, like \"Rejection is a normal part of the job search process, and it doesn't mean I'm not qualified or capable.\" But even after writing down the evidence for and against my initial thoughts, I still struggled to believe the alternative thought.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing this example, Liam. It's great that you were able to identify your initial negative thoughts and attempt to come up with alternative thoughts, even if believing them was challenging. This is a common experience when starting to work with thought records. Our negative thoughts can be deeply ingrained and tied to our emotions, making it difficult to fully accept alternative perspectives right away.\n\nOne technique that can help with this is called \"acting as if.\" This involves behaving in a way that aligns with the alternative thought, even if you don't fully believe it yet. For example, if you were to act as if you believed that rejection is a normal part of the job search process and doesn't reflect your qualifications, what might you do differently?\n\nPatient: If I truly believed that rejection is normal and not a reflection of my qualifications, I think I would be more resilient in my job search. I might take some time to feel disappointed after a rejection, but then I would try to learn from the experience and keep applying to other jobs. I wouldn't get as stuck in negative self-talk or give up as easily.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Liam. Acting in alignment with the alternative thought, even when it's difficult to believe, can help shift your perspective over time. Another technique we can use to strengthen your belief in alternative thoughts is gathering more evidence to support them. In addition to the evidence you've already identified in your thought records, are there any other experiences or pieces of information that might support the idea that rejection is a normal part of the job search process and not a reflection of your qualifications?\n\nPatient: Well, I know that most people don't get hired for every job they apply to. Even highly qualified candidates face rejection. And I have received positive feedback on my skills and qualifications in the past, even if it didn't result in a job offer. I guess those could be additional pieces of evidence.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Those are excellent examples of additional evidence that support the alternative thought. When you find yourself struggling to believe an alternative thought, it can be helpful to remind yourself of this evidence and actively look for more examples in your daily life. Over time, this process of gathering evidence and acting in alignment with the alternative thought can help shift your beliefs and make the alternative thought feel more true and natural.\n\nAnother important aspect to consider is how your cultural background and family dynamics might be influencing your negative self-talk and feelings of inadequacy. We touched on this briefly in our last session, but I'd like to explore it further. How do you think your experiences growing up and your family's expectations have shaped your beliefs about yourself and your ability to succeed?",
