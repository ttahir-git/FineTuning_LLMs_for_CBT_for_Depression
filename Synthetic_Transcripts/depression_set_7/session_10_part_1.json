  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Liam, it's great to see you again for our 10th session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. With all that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How are you doing today?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand and appreciate you sharing those limitations. I'm doing alright today, thanks for asking. It's been a bit of a challenging week, but I've been trying to apply some of the techniques we've discussed.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you've been working on applying the techniques. Can you tell me more about what made this week challenging for you?\n\nPatient: Well, I had a job interview that I was really hoping would go well, but I didn't end up getting the position. It's been tough not to fall back into those negative thought patterns, like \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I'll never find a job I love.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a tough situation, and it's understandable that it triggered some of those negative thoughts. Let's explore this further. When you found out you didn't get the job, what emotions did you experience?\n\nPatient: I felt really disappointed and discouraged. I also felt frustrated with myself, like maybe I could have prepared better or said something differently in the interview.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid emotions to feel in that situation. I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in being able to identify and express those emotions. That's an important step. Now, let's look at the thoughts that came up. You mentioned thinking \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'll never find a job I love.\" We've talked before about how these thoughts relate to some of your core beliefs. Can you tell me more about how these thoughts made you feel and what you did next?\n\nPatient: Yeah, when I started thinking those things, I felt really down on myself. I ended up spending most of the day in bed, just kind of wallowing in those negative thoughts. I know that's not the most productive response, but it felt hard to pull myself out of that mindset.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common response, and it shows a lot of insight that you're able to recognize that. Let's add exploring this situation to our agenda for today. We can work on identifying the cognitive distortions in those thoughts and coming up with some alternative responses. What else would you like to focus on in our session today?\n\nPatient: I'd also like to talk more about the behavioral experiment we discussed last time, about joining a language learning group. I've been hesitant to actually go through with it, so maybe we could explore what's holding me back there.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's a great topic to add to our agenda. So it looks like we have a few key things to focus on today: \n\n1. Exploring the thoughts and emotions related to the job interview situation\n2. Identifying cognitive distortions and alternative responses \n3. Discussing the behavioral experiment of joining a language learning group\n\nDoes that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
