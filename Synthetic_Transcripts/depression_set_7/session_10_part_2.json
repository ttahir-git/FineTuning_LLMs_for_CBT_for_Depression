  "transcript": "Patient: That sounds good to me. I think those are the main things I wanted to focus on today.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing the homework from our last session. You were going to continue practicing cognitive restructuring techniques, design and implement a behavioral experiment, and start keeping a positive data log. How did that go?\n\nPatient: Well, I did make some progress with the cognitive restructuring. I filled out a few thought records when I noticed myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns. That was helpful for catching those thoughts and trying to reframe them.\n\nTherapist: That's excellent! Can you share an example of a thought record you completed?\n\nPatient: Yeah, there was one day where I was feeling really down about my job search. My automatic thought was \"I'm never going to find a job I enjoy.\" I rated my emotions as feeling hopeless at an intensity of 8 out of 10. Then I tried to look at the evidence for and against that thought.\n\nTherapist: Fantastic. What evidence did you come up with?\n\nPatient: Well, for evidence against the thought, I realized that I have found jobs I enjoyed in the past, like my research position during grad school. And even though I haven't found the right fit yet, I'm still early in my career, so it's not unreasonable to think I could find something fulfilling in the future.\n\nTherapist: Those are great points. Recognizing your past successes and maintaining a long-term perspective can be really helpful in challenging those all-or-nothing thoughts. What about evidence for the thought?\n\nPatient: The main evidence for the thought was just that I've been applying to a lot of jobs and haven't had success yet. But I realized that doesn't necessarily mean I'll never find a job I enjoy, even if it feels that way in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Just because something hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it never will. So what was your alternative thought after considering the evidence?\n\nPatient: My alternative thought was something like \"I'm having a hard time with my job search right now, but that doesn't mean I'll never find a fulfilling job. I've had enjoyable jobs in the past, and I have skills and interests that could lead to a good fit in the future.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic thought. And how did your emotions change after coming up with that alternative?\n\nPatient: I still felt a little discouraged, but my hopelessness went down to more like a 4 out of 10. It helped to remind myself that this is just a temporary setback.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift! It's great to see you applying these techniques and having success with them. How about the behavioral experiment and positive data log? How did those go?",
