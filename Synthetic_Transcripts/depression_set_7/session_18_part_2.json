  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda looks good to me. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's begin by reviewing your progress with sleep hygiene and thought records. You mentioned that you've noticed some improvement in your ability to fall asleep, but that you still have nights where your mind races with anxious thoughts. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to stick to a consistent bedtime routine, like we discussed. I've been doing some relaxation exercises before bed, and I've noticed that it helps me feel a bit more calm. But there are still times when I can't seem to shut off my thoughts. I start worrying about the future, my job search, and what people think of me.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience for many people who struggle with anxiety and depression. Our thoughts can have a significant impact on our emotions and our ability to sleep. That's where the thought records can be helpful. Have you been using them when you notice these anxious thoughts?\n\nPatient: I have, but it's been challenging. Sometimes I don't even realize I'm having these thoughts until I'm already feeling really anxious. And even when I do catch them, it's hard to challenge them in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Liam. Recognizing and challenging our thoughts takes practice, and it's not always easy, especially when we're feeling overwhelmed. One strategy that can be helpful is to set aside some time during the day to practice thought records, even when you're not feeling particularly anxious. This can help build the skill, so it's easier to apply in the moment. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I've been expecting myself to be able to do it perfectly right away, but you're right, it's a skill that needs practice.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And even small steps can make a big difference over time. Another strategy that can be helpful is to create some coping cards with reminders of the skills you've learned, like the thought records or relaxation exercises. You can keep them by your bed or in your wallet, so you have easy access to them when you need them. Would you be willing to try that?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that could be really helpful. I like the idea of having a physical reminder of the skills I've learned.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's add that to your homework for this week - to create some coping cards with reminders of the skills you've found helpful. And remember, it's okay if you don't catch every anxious thought or if the thought records don't always work perfectly. The important thing is that you're practicing and building the skill.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. That's a good reminder. I'll definitely work on the coping cards this week.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Liam. I'm glad that resonated with you. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about the conversation you had with your parents. You mentioned that it didn't go as well as you'd hoped, even though you tried to use \"I\" statements. Can you tell me more about what happened?",
