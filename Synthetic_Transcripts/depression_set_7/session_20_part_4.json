  "transcript": "Patient: Thanks for the encouragement, Nova. I'm feeling more confident about maintaining my progress after therapy. One thing I'm still struggling with is managing my negative thoughts about my job situation. Even with the coping statements and thought records, I still find myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that those negative thoughts about your job situation are still challenging, Liam. It takes time and practice to shift those thought patterns. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a recent situation where you found yourself getting stuck in negative thoughts about your job situation?\n\nPatient: Sure. The other day, I was looking at job postings online, and I started feeling really overwhelmed and hopeless. I kept thinking, \"There are so many qualified people out there. Why would anyone hire me? I'm never going to find a job.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Liam. Those thoughts sound really distressing. Let's break down that situation using the CBT triangle. The thoughts were, \"There are so many qualified people out there. Why would anyone hire me? I'm never going to find a job.\" The emotions were feeling overwhelmed and hopeless. And the behavior was... what did you do in that situation?\n\nPatient: I ended up closing my laptop and just sitting on the couch, feeling stuck and depressed.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so the behavior was disengaging from the job search and sitting on the couch, feeling stuck and depressed. That's a common response to feeling overwhelmed and hopeless. Now, let's focus on the thoughts, \"There are so many qualified people out there. Why would anyone hire me? I'm never going to find a job.\" These thoughts contain some cognitive distortions. Can you identify any?\n\nPatient: I guess the thought \"I'm never going to find a job\" is a bit of catastrophizing. It's assuming the worst-case scenario.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Liam. Catastrophizing is when we assume the worst possible outcome without evidence. What about the thought, \"There are so many qualified people out there. Why would anyone hire me?\" Do you notice any distortions there?\n\nPatient: That one feels like a mix of disqualifying the positive and mental filter. I'm focusing on the negative aspects of the situation and discounting my own qualifications and strengths.\n\nTherapist: Excellent analysis, Liam. Disqualifying the positive is when we dismiss or minimize the positive aspects of a situation, and mental filter is when we focus exclusively on the negative details while filtering out the positive. Now that we've identified the distortions, let's challenge those thoughts. What would be a more balanced and realistic perspective?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced perspective would be that while there are a lot of qualified people out there, I also have my own unique strengths and qualifications. And even if the job search takes time, that doesn't mean I'll never find a job. It might just take persistence and patience.\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic perspective, Liam. It acknowledges the challenges of the job search while also recognizing your own strengths and the importance of persistence. Let's write that down on a thought record. In the first column, we'll write down the negative thoughts. In the second column, we'll identify the distortions. And in the third column, we'll write down the balanced thoughts. This way, you'll have a visual reminder of how to challenge those negative thoughts when they come up.\n\nPatient: That sounds helpful. I'll try to fill out a thought record next time I find myself getting stuck in negative thoughts about my job situation.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Liam. Remember, the more you practice challenging those negative thoughts, the easier it will become. And even if you don't always believe the balanced thoughts at first, the act of writing them down and considering them can help shift your perspective over time.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll keep practicing.\n\nTherapist: You're doing a great job, Liam. As we wrap up our session today, I want to check in with how you're feeling. What's your mood like now, compared to when we started the session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better. Talking through the job situation and challenging those negative thoughts helped. I still feel a bit anxious about the job search, but I feel more hopeful and equipped to handle it.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Liam. It's normal to still feel some anxiety about the job search, but it's great that you're feeling more hopeful and equipped to handle it. Remember, progress isn't always linear. There will be ups and downs, but the important thing is that you keep practicing the skills you've learned and reach out for support when you need it.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the reminder.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Liam. For homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the coping statements and thought records, especially around the job search. I also encourage you to create some more coping cards for other situations that tend to trigger negative thoughts or feelings. And if you feel up to it, try to take one small step towards your job search goals, like updating your resume or reaching out to a professional contact.\n\nPatient: That sounds manageable. I'll do my best to complete the homework.\n\nTherapist: I'm confident that you will, Liam. Remember, it's not about perfection. It's about progress and practice. And if you find yourself struggling, don't hesitate to reach out for support.\n\nPatient: I will. Thanks, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Liam. I'm here to support you. Let's plan to meet again next week at the same time. In the meantime, take care of yourself and keep practicing those CBT skills.\n\nPatient: Will do.
