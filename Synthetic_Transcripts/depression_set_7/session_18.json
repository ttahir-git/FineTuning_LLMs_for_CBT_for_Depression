I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any final thoughts or questions before we end today's session?\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance. I know this won't be easy, but I'm committed to making these changes and improving my mental health. I don't have any other questions right now, but I'll let you know if anything comes up during the week.\n\nTherapist: Hello Liam, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health and well-being. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or significant events in your life?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the sleep hygiene techniques and thought records. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I've noticed that I'm able to fall asleep a bit easier, although I still have nights where my mind races with anxious thoughts. I also had a difficult conversation with my parents about my job search and their expectations. It didn't go as well as I'd hoped, but I tried to use \"I\" statements like we discussed.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on the sleep hygiene techniques and thought records. Change takes time, and it's normal to have setbacks along the way. I'm glad to hear that you're noticing some improvement in your ability to fall asleep. Regarding the conversation with your parents, it sounds like it was a challenging situation. Using \"I\" statements is a valuable skill, and it's something we can continue to work on together. \n\nLet's set an agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it might be helpful to discuss your progress with sleep and explore any obstacles you've encountered. We can also talk about the conversation with your parents and how it made you feel. What are your thoughts on this? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'd also like to discuss how I can better manage my anxious thoughts, especially when it comes to my job search and future career. It's been a major source of stress for me lately.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely address that as well. So, our agenda for today includes:\n\n1. Reviewing your progress with sleep hygiene and thought records\n2. Discussing the conversation with your parents and exploring your feelings\n3. Developing strategies to manage anxious thoughts related to your job search and future career\n\nDoes this sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or modify?\n\nPatient: The agenda looks good to me. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's begin by reviewing your progress with sleep hygiene and thought records. You mentioned that you've noticed some improvement in your ability to fall asleep, but that you still have nights where your mind races with anxious thoughts. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to stick to a consistent bedtime routine, like we discussed. I've been doing some relaxation exercises before bed, and I've noticed that it helps me feel a bit more calm. But there are still times when I can't seem to shut off my thoughts. I start worrying about the future, my job search, and what people think of me.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience for many people who struggle with anxiety and depression. Our thoughts can have a significant impact on our emotions and our ability to sleep. That's where the thought records can be helpful. Have you been using them when you notice these anxious thoughts?\n\nPatient: I have, but it's been challenging. Sometimes I don't even realize I'm having these thoughts until I'm already feeling really anxious. And even when I do catch them, it's hard to challenge them in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Liam. Recognizing and challenging our thoughts takes practice, and it's not always easy, especially when we're feeling overwhelmed. One strategy that can be helpful is to set aside some time during the day to practice thought records, even when you're not feeling particularly anxious. This can help build the skill, so it's easier to apply in the moment. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I've been expecting myself to be able to do it perfectly right away, but you're right, it's a skill that needs practice.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And even small steps can make a big difference over time. Another strategy that can be helpful is to create some coping cards with reminders of the skills you've learned, like the thought records or relaxation exercises. You can keep them by your bed or in your wallet, so you have easy access to them when you need them. Would you be willing to try that?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that could be really helpful. I like the idea of having a physical reminder of the skills I've learned.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's add that to your homework for this week - to create some coping cards with reminders of the skills you've found helpful. And remember, it's okay if you don't catch every anxious thought or if the thought records don't always work perfectly. The important thing is that you're practicing and building the skill.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. That's a good reminder. I'll definitely work on the coping cards this week.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Liam. I'm glad that resonated with you. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about the conversation you had with your parents. You mentioned that it didn't go as well as you'd hoped, even though you tried to use \"I\" statements. Can you tell me more about what happened?\n\nPatient: The conversation with my parents was really difficult. I tried to express how their expectations and pressure were affecting me, but they didn't seem to understand. They kept saying that they just want the best for me and that I should be focusing on finding a job instead of \"wasting time\" on therapy.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like that conversation brought up a lot of difficult emotions for you. It can be really challenging when we feel like our loved ones don't understand or validate our experiences. Let's explore this further. What thoughts were going through your mind during and after the conversation?\n\nPatient: I kept thinking that they don't really care about me, only about my achievements. And that maybe they're right, maybe I am just wasting my time with therapy and I should be focusing on finding a job.\n\nTherapist: Those are some really heavy thoughts, Liam. I can see how they would lead to feelings of sadness and hopelessness. Let's take a step back and examine these thoughts more closely. Do you think there might be any cognitive distortions at play here, like all-or-nothing thinking or mind reading?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess there is some all-or-nothing thinking. Just because they want me to find a job doesn't mean they don't care about me at all. And I don't know for sure that they think therapy is a waste of time - that might be me mind reading.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Liam. You're absolutely right. It's easy to fall into those cognitive distortions, especially when we're feeling emotional. Let's try to reframe those thoughts in a more balanced way. What's another perspective on your parents' reactions?\n\nPatient: I suppose they might just be worried about me and my future. They've always put a lot of emphasis on career success, so maybe that's their way of showing they care, even if it doesn't feel that way to me.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important alternative perspective, Liam. It's possible that your parents' intentions are coming from a place of love and concern, even if their communication isn't always helpful. How does that reframe change the way you feel about the situation?\n\nPatient: It helps a bit. I still wish they could understand how their pressure affects me, but I can see that they might have good intentions.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, Liam. It's okay to feel both frustrated by their reactions and also recognize their potential good intentions. Remember, other people's behaviors don't define your worth or the validity of your feelings and experiences. You're allowed to set boundaries and communicate your needs, even if others don't always respond perfectly.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I guess I need to work on asserting myself more, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nTherapist: Asserting yourself can definitely be uncomfortable, especially at first. But it's a skill that can be practiced and developed over time. We can continue to work on that together. Speaking of skills, let's revisit the anxious thoughts you've been having about your job search and future career. Have you been using any of the CBT techniques we've discussed to manage those thoughts?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to use the thought records when I get really stuck in those anxious thoughts about my job search. It helps a bit to write it all out and try to challenge those thoughts, but it's still really hard not to get caught up in the worry.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been using the thought records, Liam. It's a powerful tool for managing anxious thoughts, but you're right, it can still be challenging not to get caught up in the worry at times. That's where some of the other CBT techniques we've discussed can be helpful, like mindfulness and relaxation exercises. Have you been practicing those as well?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I've been trying to do the deep breathing exercises when I feel myself getting really anxious. It helps a bit in the moment, but it's hard to remember to do it when I'm really caught up in the worry.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Liam. It can be hard to remember to use these skills in the moment, especially when we're feeling really emotional. That's why practicing them regularly, even when we're not feeling particularly anxious, can be so helpful. It makes it easier to access those skills when we need them.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I need to make more of an effort to practice the relaxation exercises regularly, not just when I'm feeling anxious.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Liam. Regular practice can make a big difference. Another strategy that can be helpful is to create some visual reminders for yourself - like a sticky note on your computer or a reminder on your phone - to prompt you to take a few deep breaths or do a quick mindfulness exercise throughout the day. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I like the idea of having a visual reminder. I think that could help me remember to take a step back and use the skills we've been working on.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's add that to your homework for this week - to create some visual reminders to prompt you to practice your relaxation and mindfulness exercises throughout the day. And remember, it's okay if you don't catch every anxious thought or if the skills don't always work perfectly. The important thing is that you're practicing and building the skills.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. That's a good reminder. I'll definitely work on the visual reminders this week.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Liam. I'm glad that resonated with you. Before we wrap up for today, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling after our session today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better. It's helpful to talk through these things and have some concrete strategies to work on. I know it's not going to be easy, but I feel a bit more hopeful.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Liam. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. But every small step counts, and you're doing a great job of building these skills and insights. \n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to:\n1. Continue practicing your sleep hygiene routine and using thought records when you notice anxious thoughts.\n2. Create some coping cards with reminders of the skills you've found helpful, like the thought records and relaxation exercises.\n3. Practice using \"I\" statements in your interactions with others, especially in difficult conversations.\n4. Create some visual reminders to prompt you to practice your relaxation and mindfulness exercises throughout the day.\n\nDoes this feel manageable for you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, that feels manageable. I'll definitely work on all of those things this week.\n\nTherapist: Great. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns during the week, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate that.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Liam. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week. Take care until then.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewing progress with sleep hygiene and thought records\n  - Discussing the conversation with Liam's parents and exploring his feelings\n  - Developing strategies to manage anxious thoughts related to job search and future career\n  - Introducing the idea of visual reminders to prompt use of CBT skills\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records to challenge anxious thoughts related to job search\n  - \"I\" statements for assertive communication\n  - Coping cards with reminders of CBT skills\n  - Visual reminders to prompt use of relaxation and mindfulness exercises\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue practicing sleep hygiene routine and using thought records when noticing anxious thoughts\n  - Create coping cards with reminders of helpful CBT skills\n  - Practice using \"I\" statements in interactions with others, especially in difficult conversations\n  - Create visual reminders to prompt practice of relaxation and mindfulness exercises throughout the day\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - Liam is making progress with recognizing and challenging anxious thoughts, but still struggles with insomnia and low mood\n  - Relationships with family members are strained due to depression and communication difficulties\n  - Liam is feeling more hopeful after today's session, but acknowledges that change takes time and practice\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Core beliefs: \"I'm not good enough,\" \"If I'm not perfect, people will reject me.\"\n  - Intermediate beliefs: \"If I don't achieve my goals, I'm a failure,\" \"I'll never be happy or have meaningful relationships.\"\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue exploring how Liam's cultural background and family dynamics influence his beliefs and behaviors related to mental health and therapy\n  - Monitor progress with sleep hygiene, thought records, assertiveness skills, and visual reminders\n  - Build on insights and techniques from today's session, and introduce additional CBT techniques as appropriate\n  - Follow up on Liam's reflections on progress and insights gained in therapy\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review homework from this session, including sleep hygiene, thought records, coping cards, \"I\" statements, and visual reminders\n  - Discuss any new challenges or insights that arose over the week, and troubleshoot any difficulties with implementing techniques\n  - Continue exploring and challenging negative core beliefs, and work on building new, more adaptive beliefs\n  - Introduce additional CBT techniques as appropriate, such as cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation\n\n",
