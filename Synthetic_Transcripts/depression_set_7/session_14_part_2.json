  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for CBT session 14 with Liam:\n\nPatient: Using the thought records has been helpful for catching my negative thoughts and trying to reframe them. The downward arrow technique was a bit harder \u2013 I found it challenging to keep asking myself \"what would that mean?\" without getting stuck in a negative spiral.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're finding the thought records useful for identifying and reframing negative thoughts. The downward arrow technique can be tricky, as it requires a delicate balance between exploring deeper beliefs and not getting caught up in rumination. It's a skill that develops with practice.\n\nCan you share an example of a thought record you completed this week? I'd love to hear about a specific situation and how you worked through it.\n\nPatient: Sure. A few days ago, I applied for a job that I thought I was really qualified for. I spent a lot of time on the application, but then I started thinking, \"I'm not going to get this job. There are probably so many other qualified candidates.\" I felt really discouraged and hopeless.\n\nFor the thought record, I wrote down the situation \u2013 applying for the job \u2013 and my emotions, which were sadness and hopelessness, both at about an 8 out of 10. Then I tried to identify the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm not going to get this job.\"\n\nThe evidence for the thought was that I've been rejected from a lot of jobs recently, and the job market is really competitive. The evidence against the thought was that I do have relevant qualifications and experience, and I spent a lot of time tailoring my application to the job description.\n\nI tried to come up with an alternative thought, which was \"I don't know for sure if I'll get the job, but I do know that I'm qualified and I put my best effort into the application. All I can do is wait and see what happens.\"\n\nAfter doing the thought record, I re-rated my emotions, and the sadness and hopelessness had gone down to about a 5 out of 10. So it definitely helped, even though the negative thoughts didn't completely go away.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example, Liam. You did an excellent job of identifying the situation, your emotions, and the evidence for and against the negative thought. And the alternative thought you came up with is much more balanced and realistic.\n\nIt's normal for the negative thoughts not to completely disappear \u2013 the goal is to develop more flexible, adaptive ways of thinking, rather than trying to get rid of negative thoughts altogether. And as you noticed, even though the emotions didn't go away completely, they did decrease in intensity, which is a significant accomplishment.\n\nYou mentioned that the downward arrow technique was more challenging. Can you walk me through an example of how you tried to use it?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I tried to use the downward arrow technique with the same situation of applying for the job. I started with the thought \"I'm not going to get this job,\" and then I asked myself, \"If that were true, what would that mean?\"\n\nMy first answer was \"It would mean that I'm not good enough.\" Then I asked myself, \"If I'm not good enough, what would that mean?\" And my answer was \"It would mean that I'm a failure.\"\n\nI got stuck there because I couldn't really think of an answer to the question \"If I'm a failure, what would that mean?\" that didn't just feel like more of the same negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a great start, Liam. The downward arrow technique is designed to help us uncover the deeper beliefs underlying our automatic thoughts, and it can be challenging to keep going when the beliefs feel really painful or entrenched.\n\nIn the example you shared, it seems like the core belief might be something like \"If I don't succeed at everything, I'm a failure.\" Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that's definitely a belief that I struggle with. It's hard for me to separate my self-worth from my achievements.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common and understandable belief, Liam. Many people struggle with tying their self-worth to external achievements or outcomes. The good news is that we can work on reframing that belief and developing a more compassionate, realistic way of thinking about yourself.\n\nOne way to start doing that is to look for evidence that contradicts the belief \"If I don't succeed at everything, I'm a failure.\" For example, can you think of a time when you didn't succeed at something but you didn't see yourself as a failure?\n\nPatient: I guess one example is when I was learning Spanish. I made a lot of mistakes at first, but I didn't see myself as a failure \u2013 I saw it as part of the learning process.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Liam. Learning a language is a perfect illustration of how making mistakes and having setbacks is a natural part of growth and learning. It doesn't mean you're a failure \u2013 it means you're human.\n\nAnother way to reframe the belief \"If I don't succeed at everything, I'm a failure\" is to consider what you would say to a friend who expressed that belief. Would you agree with them, or would you offer a different perspective?\n\nPatient: I think I would probably tell a friend that their worth isn't defined by their achievements, and that everyone has strengths and weaknesses. I would try to remind them of their positive qualities and the things they've accomplished, even if they're not perfect.\n\nTherapist: That's a really compassionate and wise perspective, Liam. It's often easier to be kind and understanding towards others than it is to extend that same compassion to ourselves. But the things you would say to a friend are just as true for you \u2013 your worth isn't defined by your achievements, and you have many positive qualities and accomplishments, even if you're not perfect.\n\nAs we continue with our work together, we can keep practicing identifying and reframing these kinds of core beliefs. It's a process, and it takes time and practice, but it can lead to significant shifts in how you think about yourself and your life.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I know it's not going to be easy, but I'm willing to keep working on it. It's helpful to have these tools and techniques to use when I'm struggling with negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I'm really glad to hear that, Liam. You're absolutely right that it's not easy, but you're already making progress and developing valuable skills. And you don't have to do it alone \u2013 I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nIn addition to the thought records and downward arrow technique, how did you find the other homework assignments \u2013 the positive data log, behavioral activation plan, worry time, and 5-5-5 mindfulness technique?\n\nPatient: The positive data log was helpful for reminding me of my strengths and accomplishments. It was nice to have a record of positive things to look back on when I was feeling down.\n\nThe behavioral activation plan was hit or miss \u2013 some days I was able to do the activities I planned, but other days I just didn't have the energy or motivation.\n\nI tried the worry time technique a couple of times, but I found it hard to stick to the designated time. I kept getting caught up in worries throughout the day.\n\nThe 5-5-5 technique was interesting \u2013 it helped me to ground myself in the present moment when I was feeling anxious or overwhelmed. But I didn't always remember to use it in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing your experiences with the homework, Liam. It's really common for different techniques to be more or less helpful at different times, and it's okay if some of them don't feel like a good fit right now.\n\nThe positive data log and 5-5-5 technique seem like they were helpful for you, so we can definitely keep using those. With the behavioral activation plan, it might be helpful to set smaller, more manageable goals on days when your energy and motivation are lower. Even a small accomplishment can help to boost your mood and give you a sense of progress.\n\nAs for the worry time technique, it can take some practice to get used to postponing worries until a designated time. One thing that can help is to write down the worries as they come up throughout the day, and then tell yourself that you'll address them during worry time. That way, you're not trying to push the worries away completely \u2013 you're just setting them aside until later.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can try writing down my worries and see if that helps me to stick to the worry time.\n\nTherapist: Great, I think that's a good plan. And remember, it's okay if the techniques don't work perfectly every time. The goal is to practice and experiment with different strategies, and over time you'll develop a toolkit of coping skills that work for you.\n\nBefore we move on, I want to check in \u2013 how are you feeling about the progress we've made so far in our work together? Do you have any questions or concerns about the direction we're going in?",
