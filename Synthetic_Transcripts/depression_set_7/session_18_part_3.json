  "transcript": "Patient: The conversation with my parents was really difficult. I tried to express how their expectations and pressure were affecting me, but they didn't seem to understand. They kept saying that they just want the best for me and that I should be focusing on finding a job instead of \"wasting time\" on therapy.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like that conversation brought up a lot of difficult emotions for you. It can be really challenging when we feel like our loved ones don't understand or validate our experiences. Let's explore this further. What thoughts were going through your mind during and after the conversation?\n\nPatient: I kept thinking that they don't really care about me, only about my achievements. And that maybe they're right, maybe I am just wasting my time with therapy and I should be focusing on finding a job.\n\nTherapist: Those are some really heavy thoughts, Liam. I can see how they would lead to feelings of sadness and hopelessness. Let's take a step back and examine these thoughts more closely. Do you think there might be any cognitive distortions at play here, like all-or-nothing thinking or mind reading?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess there is some all-or-nothing thinking. Just because they want me to find a job doesn't mean they don't care about me at all. And I don't know for sure that they think therapy is a waste of time - that might be me mind reading.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Liam. You're absolutely right. It's easy to fall into those cognitive distortions, especially when we're feeling emotional. Let's try to reframe those thoughts in a more balanced way. What's another perspective on your parents' reactions?\n\nPatient: I suppose they might just be worried about me and my future. They've always put a lot of emphasis on career success, so maybe that's their way of showing they care, even if it doesn't feel that way to me.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important alternative perspective, Liam. It's possible that your parents' intentions are coming from a place of love and concern, even if their communication isn't always helpful. How does that reframe change the way you feel about the situation?\n\nPatient: It helps a bit. I still wish they could understand how their pressure affects me, but I can see that they might have good intentions.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, Liam. It's okay to feel both frustrated by their reactions and also recognize their potential good intentions. Remember, other people's behaviors don't define your worth or the validity of your feelings and experiences. You're allowed to set boundaries and communicate your needs, even if others don't always respond perfectly.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I guess I need to work on asserting myself more, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nTherapist: Asserting yourself can definitely be uncomfortable, especially at first. But it's a skill that can be practiced and developed over time. We can continue to work on that together. Speaking of skills, let's revisit the anxious thoughts you've been having about your job search and future career. Have you been using any of the CBT techniques we've discussed to manage those thoughts?",
