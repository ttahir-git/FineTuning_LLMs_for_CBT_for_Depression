  "transcript": "Patient: I think that covers the main things I wanted to discuss today. I'm glad we have a plan for the session.\n\nTherapist: Great, I'm looking forward to diving into these topics with you. Before we move on, I want to check in about the homework we discussed last session. How did you find the process of creating coping cards and visual reminders?\n\nPatient: It was helpful to have those physical reminders of the skills we've been working on. I put the coping cards in my wallet, so I can pull them out whenever I need a boost. And the visual reminders around my apartment have been good prompts to practice relaxation and mindfulness exercises.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. Having those tangible reminders can be really powerful in helping you apply the skills we've been practicing. Did you notice any challenges or insights as you worked on this homework?\n\nPatient: At first, I felt a bit silly having these reminders everywhere, but I realized that's just my inner critic talking. The more I used them, the more I saw their value. It's still hard to remember to use the skills sometimes, especially when I'm feeling really down or anxious.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to have that critical voice pop up, and it's great that you were able to recognize it for what it is. And you're right, it can be challenging to remember to use these skills when you're in the midst of difficult emotions. That's why we practice - so it becomes more automatic over time. I'm curious, were there any specific situations where you found the coping cards or visual reminders particularly helpful?\n\nPatient: Last week, I had a really rough day with my job search. I got another rejection email, and I could feel myself spiraling into negative thoughts. But then I saw one of the visual reminders I had put up - a quote about resilience that we had discussed. It reminded me to pull out my coping cards and go through some of the statements we had practiced, like \"Rejection is not a reflection of my worth\" and \"I have overcome challenges before, and I can do it again.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example of how these tools can help in those moments when we might otherwise get stuck in negative thought patterns. It takes a lot of strength to interrupt that spiral and turn to healthier coping strategies. I'm really proud of you for using those skills in a difficult moment.\n\nPatient: Thanks, it felt good to have those tools to turn to. I'm starting to see how I can use them in other situations too, like when I'm feeling overwhelmed by family stuff.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, these skills are versatile and can be applied to many different challenges. Speaking of family, let's dive into that topic a bit more. You mentioned feeling guilty about relying on your parents financially and struggling to communicate your needs. Can you tell me more about what's been coming up for you in your relationship with your parents?",
