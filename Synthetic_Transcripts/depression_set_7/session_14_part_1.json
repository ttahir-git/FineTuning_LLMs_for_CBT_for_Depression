  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Liam, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or notable experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like the worry time and 5-5-5 mindfulness. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in managing my negative thoughts and worries. However, I've also had a couple of rough days where I struggled to get out of bed and felt overwhelmed by everything.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques and have noticed some improvements, even if they're small. It's also important to acknowledge the rough days and the challenges you're facing. Can you tell me more about what made those days particularly difficult?\n\nPatient: On those rough days, I woke up feeling exhausted and had no motivation to do anything. I kept thinking about how I'm still unemployed and single, and I started spiraling into negative thoughts about my future. Even though I tried using the techniques, it was hard to shift my mindset.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Liam. It's common to have ups and downs, and it's okay if the techniques don't always feel effective in the moment. The fact that you're continuing to try is a significant step forward. Today, we can explore those negative thoughts further and work on building more adaptive beliefs. \n\nBefore we dive in, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize today? We could review your homework, discuss the rough days in more detail, or explore any other topics that feel important to you.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to discuss the rough days more and see if we can find ways to cope better when I'm feeling really low. We could also review my homework and see if there are any adjustments I can make to the techniques I'm using.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Liam. We can start by reviewing your homework and then delve into the rough days, exploring your thoughts and feelings in more depth. We'll work together to find coping strategies that feel manageable and effective for you. Let's begin with the homework review \u2013 how did you find the process of using thought records and the downward arrow technique over the past week?",
