  "transcript": "Patient: I've found the thought records to be really helpful, especially when I'm feeling down or anxious. It helps me to see things more clearly and challenge my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Liam. Thought records are a powerful tool for identifying and challenging negative thoughts. Another technique that can be helpful is creating coping cards. These are small cards that you can carry with you and pull out when you need a reminder of your CBT skills. On one side, you can write down a situation that tends to trigger negative thoughts or feelings. On the other side, you can write down a coping statement or a reminder of a CBT technique that you can use in that situation. What do you think about creating some coping cards for yourself?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good idea. I can think of a few situations where I could use a reminder of my CBT skills.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's create a coping card together now. Can you think of a situation that tends to trigger negative thoughts or feelings for you?\n\nPatient: One situation that comes to mind is when I'm applying for jobs and I don't hear back. I start to feel really down and think that I'll never find a job.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write that situation down on one side of the card. On the other side, what could be a helpful reminder or coping statement?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"Rejection is part of the process. It doesn't mean I'm not good enough. Keep trying and focus on what I can control.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great coping statement, Liam. It acknowledges the difficulty of the situation while also reminding you of a more balanced perspective. Let's write that down on the other side of the card. You can create more coping cards for other situations that tend to trigger negative thoughts or feelings. The more you practice using them, the more automatic it will become to challenge those thoughts.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to create some more coping cards for other situations.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. Another important part of maintaining your progress after therapy is having a support system. We've talked about your family and how they can sometimes be a source of stress. But are there other people in your life who you feel supported by?\n\nPatient: I have a few close friends who I can talk to. And I've been trying to get more involved in the LGBTQ+ community. I went to a meetup last week and met some really nice people.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Liam. Building a support system outside of your family can be really helpful. And getting involved in the LGBTQ+ community can provide a sense of belonging and acceptance. Are there any other ways that you can think of to build your support system?\n\nPatient: I've been thinking about joining a support group for people with depression. I think it could be helpful to talk to other people who understand what I'm going through.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Liam. A support group can provide a safe space to share your experiences and get support from others who can relate. It can also be a way to build connections and feel less alone. I encourage you to look into that further.\n\nPatient: I will. Thanks for the encouragement.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Liam. I'm here to support you. As we continue to work together, we'll keep exploring ways to build your support system and maintain your progress after therapy. Remember, it's a process, and it takes time and practice. But you're doing a great job, and I'm confident that you'll continue to make progress.",
