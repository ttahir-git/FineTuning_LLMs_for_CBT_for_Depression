  "transcript": "Patient: I'd like to focus on managing my anxiety about the upcoming family gatherings and also discuss how I can continue to make progress after our sessions end.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on, Liam. Let's start with your anxiety about the family gatherings. We've been working on using \"I\" statements and coping statements to help you communicate more effectively and manage anxiety in the moment. How has practicing these techniques been going for you?\n\nPatient: It's been challenging, but I'm starting to see some progress. I've been practicing the \"I\" statements with my mom, and it's helped me feel more heard and understood. But I'm still struggling with the anxiety leading up to the gatherings.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're seeing some progress with the \"I\" statements. That's a big step forward. Regarding the anxiety leading up to the gatherings, let's explore that a bit more. Can you walk me through a specific situation where you felt anxious about an upcoming gathering?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I was invited to a family dinner at my aunt's house. As soon as I got the invitation, I started feeling anxious. I kept thinking about how everyone would be asking me about my job situation and judging me for not having a job yet.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Liam. Let's break down that situation using the CBT triangle. The thought was that everyone would be asking about your job situation and judging you. The emotion was anxiety. And the behavior was... what did you do in that situation?\n\nPatient: I ended up making an excuse not to go. I told them I wasn't feeling well, even though that wasn't entirely true.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so the behavior was avoiding the situation. That's a common response to anxiety. Now, let's focus on the thought that everyone would be asking about your job situation and judging you. Is there evidence to support that thought?\n\nPatient: Well, my family does tend to ask about my job situation a lot. But I guess I don't know for sure that they would be judging me.\n\nTherapist: That's an important distinction. It's possible that they might ask about your job situation, but the judgment part is an assumption. Let's look at that assumption more closely. What would you say to a friend who was in a similar situation and had the same thought?\n\nPatient: I'd probably tell them that people might ask about their job situation, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're judging them. And even if some people are judgmental, that says more about them than it does about my friend.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Liam. Can you apply that same logic to your own situation?\n\nPatient: I guess I can try. It's just hard to shake that feeling of being judged.\n\nTherapist: I understand. It's a process, and it takes practice. Let's come up with a coping statement that you can use when you start feeling anxious about being judged.\n\nPatient: How about something like, \"People might ask about my job situation, but that doesn't mean they're judging me. And even if some people are judgmental, that says more about them than it does about me.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great coping statement, Liam. It directly challenges the assumption that people are judging you and reframes the situation in a more balanced way. Let's practice using that coping statement in the context of the family dinner invitation. Imagine yourself receiving the invitation and starting to feel anxious. What can you do in that moment?\n\nPatient: I can remind myself of the coping statement. I can also try to focus on the positive aspects of the gathering, like spending time with family members I haven't seen in a while.\n\nTherapist: That's great. Focusing on the positive aspects is a form of cognitive restructuring, which is a key CBT technique. You're shifting your attention from the negative thoughts to more balanced, realistic thoughts. As you continue to practice this, it will become easier to manage your anxiety in those situations.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll keep practicing the coping statement and trying to focus on the positive.\n\nTherapist: You're doing a great job, Liam. Remember, it's a process, and it takes time and practice. But you're making really good progress. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about how you can continue to make progress after our sessions end. One of the key things is to continue using the CBT skills and techniques that you've learned. We've talked about \"I\" statements, coping statements, and cognitive restructuring. Are there any other techniques that you've found particularly helpful?",
