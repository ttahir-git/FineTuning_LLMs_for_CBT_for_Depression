  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Liam, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health and well-being. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or significant events in your life?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the sleep hygiene techniques and thought records. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I've noticed that I'm able to fall asleep a bit easier, although I still have nights where my mind races with anxious thoughts. I also had a difficult conversation with my parents about my job search and their expectations. It didn't go as well as I'd hoped, but I tried to use \"I\" statements like we discussed.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on the sleep hygiene techniques and thought records. Change takes time, and it's normal to have setbacks along the way. I'm glad to hear that you're noticing some improvement in your ability to fall asleep. Regarding the conversation with your parents, it sounds like it was a challenging situation. Using \"I\" statements is a valuable skill, and it's something we can continue to work on together. \n\nLet's set an agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it might be helpful to discuss your progress with sleep and explore any obstacles you've encountered. We can also talk about the conversation with your parents and how it made you feel. What are your thoughts on this? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'd also like to discuss how I can better manage my anxious thoughts, especially when it comes to my job search and future career. It's been a major source of stress for me lately.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely address that as well. So, our agenda for today includes:\n\n1. Reviewing your progress with sleep hygiene and thought records\n2. Discussing the conversation with your parents and exploring your feelings\n3. Developing strategies to manage anxious thoughts related to your job search and future career\n\nDoes this sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or modify?",
