  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, there's one entry from last week that stood out to me. It was when I got a rejection email from a job I had applied for. My initial thoughts were, \"I knew I wasn't good enough for that job\" and \"I'll never find a job that makes me happy.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Liam. Those thoughts can be really painful and discouraging. Let's take a closer look at them using the thought record. First, can you tell me what emotions you were feeling when you had those thoughts?\n\nPatient: I was feeling really down and hopeless. I think I also felt a bit angry at myself for even bothering to apply.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why you would feel that way. Let's rate the intensity of those emotions on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the most intense. How intense were the feelings of sadness and hopelessness?\n\nPatient: I'd say they were around 85 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: And how about the anger towards yourself?\n\nPatient: Maybe a 65.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have sadness and hopelessness at 85 and anger at 65. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I knew I wasn't good enough for that job.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I didn't get the job, so that's pretty clear evidence that I wasn't good enough.\n\nTherapist: I can see why it might feel that way. Now, let's consider evidence against that thought. Have you ever received positive feedback in your previous jobs or academic pursuits?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess so. I did well in my doctoral program, and I had a good relationship with my colleagues at my previous job.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're not good enough. It sounds like you have a history of success and positive feedback in your professional life. Now, let's look at the thought \"I'll never find a job that makes me happy.\" What evidence do you have for this thought?\n\nPatient: I've been applying to jobs for months now, and I haven't had any luck. It feels like I'll never find something that's a good fit for me.\n\nTherapist: I can see why you might feel that way, given your recent experiences. Now, let's consider evidence against that thought. Have you ever had a job or an experience that brought you happiness or fulfillment?\n\nPatient: I guess my previous job had its moments. And I really enjoyed my doctoral research.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you'll never find a job that makes you happy. It shows that you've had experiences of happiness and fulfillment in your professional life before. Now, let's try to come up with some alternative thoughts based on the evidence we've discussed. What might be a more balanced way of looking at the situation?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could think, \"Not getting this job doesn't mean I'm not good enough. I have a history of success, and this is just one setback.\" And for the other thought, maybe something like, \"I've had fulfilling experiences before, and I can find them again, even if it takes some time.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are great alternative thoughts, Liam. They acknowledge the disappointment of not getting the job while also recognizing your past successes and the potential for future fulfillment. Now, let's re-rate your emotions based on these alternative thoughts. How intense are the feelings of sadness and hopelessness now?\n\nPatient: They're still there, but maybe more like a 60 now.\n\nTherapist: And how about the anger towards yourself?\n\nPatient: That's gone down too, maybe to a 40.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant decrease in intensity for both emotions. This shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing our feelings. By examining the evidence and coming up with more balanced thoughts, we can shift our emotional experience.\n\nPatient: I can see that. It's just hard to do in the moment when I'm feeling really down.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's why we practice with the thought records. Over time, it becomes easier to catch those negative thoughts and challenge them in the moment. It's a skill that takes time and repetition to build, just like any other.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just need to keep practicing.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, and that's what we're here for. As you continue with the thought records, remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself. It's okay if it feels challenging at times \u2013 that's part of the process of learning and growing.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Liam. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Now, let's take a look at your behavioral activation plan. How has it been going with engaging in activities that bring a sense of accomplishment or enjoyment?\n\nPatient: It's been a bit hit-or-miss. Some days I'm able to do the activities I planned, and I do feel a bit better afterwards. But other days, I just don't have the energy or motivation to do anything.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience, Liam. Depression can make it really difficult to engage in activities, even when we know they might help us feel better. On the days when you don't have the energy or motivation, can you think of any small activities that feel more manageable?\n\nPatient: I guess on those days, even something like taking a shower or making myself a decent meal feels like an accomplishment.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Those are great examples of small activities that can contribute to a sense of accomplishment. On days when your energy is low, try to focus on those smaller, more manageable tasks. Even a short walk around the block or a few minutes of stretching can be helpful.\n\nPatient: I can try that. It's just frustrating because I want to be able to do more, but I feel so limited by my depression.\n\nTherapist: I completely understand that frustration, Liam. It's important to remember that depression is an illness, and it's not a reflection of your worth or abilities. By engaging in small activities, even on difficult days, you're taking steps towards managing your depression and improving your overall well-being.\n\nPatient: I guess you're right. I just wish I could fast-forward to feeling better, you know?\n\nTherapist: I know it can be really difficult to be patient with the process, especially when you're in the midst of depression. Remember that each small step you take is a step towards feeling better, even if it doesn't feel that way in the moment. We're here to support you through this process and celebrate each victory along the way, no matter how small it may seem.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. That means a lot to me.",
