  "transcript": "Patient: When I tried to think of evidence against my negative thoughts, my mind just went blank. I couldn't think of anything positive about myself, and it felt like I was lying to myself by trying to come up with something.\n\nTherapist: It's common to feel that way when you're struggling with negative core beliefs. Your mind is so used to focusing on the negative that it can be challenging to see the positive, even when it's there. That's why we need to train our minds to look for evidence that contradicts those negative beliefs.\n\nOne way to make the positive data log more manageable is to start small. Instead of trying to come up with big, significant examples, look for small, everyday things that challenge your negative beliefs. For example, if you believe \"I'm not good enough,\" you could write down any time you complete a task, no matter how small, or when someone expresses appreciation for something you've done.\n\nAnother strategy is to ask yourself, \"What would I say to a friend in this situation?\" Often, we're much kinder and more objective when it comes to others than we are with ourselves. By taking that perspective, you might find it easier to identify evidence against your negative thoughts.\n\nPatient: I can see how starting small might make it easier. I guess I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself to come up with big examples, but maybe I don't need to do that.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Every piece of evidence, no matter how small, is valuable in challenging those negative beliefs. And as you practice, it will become easier to identify and record those examples.\n\nAnother important thing to remember is that you don't have to believe the evidence 100% at first. The goal is to start building a case against your negative beliefs, even if it feels a bit uncomfortable or unfamiliar at first. Over time, as you accumulate more evidence, it will become easier to see the truth in those positive statements.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to be more mindful of the small things and write them down, even if I don't fully believe them yet.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Marcus. And remember, this is a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate each small victory along the way.\n\nNow, let's shift our focus to the challenges you've been facing with engaging in social activities. You mentioned that you've been struggling to find the motivation and energy to reach out to others. Can you tell me more about what's been holding you back?",
