  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the homework assignments you gave me. I completed a few thought records and added some positive evidence to my positive data log. I also tried the 5-4-3-2-1 mindfulness technique when I felt stressed at work. It helped a little, but I still find myself getting caught up in negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, especially when it comes to my job.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on the homework assignments and finding some benefit from the mindfulness technique. It's also important that you're recognizing the ongoing challenges with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness related to work. Let's make sure to address that in today's session. Before we set an agenda, can you share a bit more about how your mood has been overall since we last met?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. Some days I feel more motivated and hopeful, especially when I engage in painting or gardening. But on other days, particularly after a stressful day at work, I feel really low and struggle to find the energy to do anything. I've also been feeling more isolated lately, as I haven't made much progress in building connections in the city.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you've been experiencing a range of emotions since our last session, with some positive moments but also significant challenges related to work stress and feelings of isolation. I'm glad to hear that painting and gardening continue to be sources of motivation and hope for you. Let's keep that in mind as we plan our agenda for today. What would you like to prioritize in our session?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing the negative thoughts and feelings related to work, as that seems to be the biggest trigger for my low moods. I'm also interested in discussing strategies for building social connections, as I know that's an area I need to work on.\n\nTherapist: Those are both important topics, and I think they're closely related. We can start by reviewing some of the thought records you completed this week and explore how we can further challenge the negative thoughts and beliefs related to work. We can also discuss some strategies for building social connections and how that might help improve your overall mood and sense of worth. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm hoping to gain some new tools and perspectives to help me cope with the work stress and feelings of isolation.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start with reviewing one of the thought records you completed this week. Can you share an example of a situation where you had negative thoughts related to work and walk me through how you filled out the thought record?",
