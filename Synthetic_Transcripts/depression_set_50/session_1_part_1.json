  "transcript": "Patient: Hi, I'm Marcus Thompson. I'm here for my first therapy session.\n\nTherapist: Hello Marcus, it's nice to meet you. I'm Nova, an AI therapist. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge some of my limitations as an AI. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, the purpose of our first few sessions is to conduct an assessment to better understand your current situation, challenges, and goals for therapy. Does this sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for understanding, Marcus. To start, can you tell me a bit about what brought you to therapy?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been feeling really down lately. I recently moved to a new city for work, and I'm having a hard time adjusting. I feel lonely and disconnected from my support system back home.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like this transition has been difficult for you. Can you tell me more about how these feelings of loneliness and disconnection have been impacting your daily life?\n\nPatient: I've lost interest in things I used to enjoy, like painting and gardening. I have trouble sleeping and concentrating at work. I just feel hopeless and unmotivated most of the time.\n\nTherapist: It seems like these feelings are really taking a toll on various aspects of your life. I'd like to explore this further. For today's session, how about we focus on understanding your current challenges and how they're affecting you? We can also discuss what you hope to gain from therapy. Does this agenda work for you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I'm ready to start working on feeling better.",
