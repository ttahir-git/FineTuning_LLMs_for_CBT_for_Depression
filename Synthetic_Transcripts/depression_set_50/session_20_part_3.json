  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's dive deeper into creating your relapse prevention plan. One important aspect is identifying early warning signs that your depression symptoms may be returning. These signs can be different for everyone, but some common ones include changes in sleep patterns, appetite, or energy levels, withdrawing from social activities, or noticing an increase in negative thoughts. What early warning signs have you noticed in the past when your depression was starting to worsen?\n\nPatient: In the past, I've noticed that I start to isolate myself more. I might stop responding to texts or decline invitations to hang out with friends. I also tend to have trouble sleeping, either sleeping too much or not being able to sleep at all. And my thoughts become more negative, like feeling hopeless or worthless.\n\nTherapist: Those are great insights, Marcus. Recognizing these early warning signs is an important step in managing potential setbacks. Now, let's brainstorm some strategies you can use when you notice these signs. We can build on the CBT tools you've already been using, like thought records and self-care activities. What else do you think might be helpful?\n\nPatient: I think reaching out to my support system could be helpful, even if it's just sending a text to let someone know I'm struggling. I could also try to do some activities that I know usually help my mood, like painting or going for a walk. And maybe reviewing some of the coping cards we've created, to remind myself of more helpful ways of thinking.\n\nTherapist: Those are all excellent strategies, Marcus. Reaching out to your support system is particularly important, as social connection can be a powerful buffer against depression. Painting and walking are great examples of behavioral activation, which we know can help improve mood. And reviewing your coping cards is a great way to challenge negative thoughts and reinforce more adaptive beliefs.\n\nAnother helpful tool in your relapse prevention plan could be a \"wellness action plan.\" This is a written plan that outlines specific steps you can take if you notice your symptoms starting to worsen. It might include things like scheduling an appointment with a therapist, reaching out to a specific friend or family member, or engaging in certain self-care activities. What do you think about creating a wellness action plan as part of your relapse prevention plan?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. Having a specific plan to follow could make it easier to take action when I'm feeling depressed. It's hard to think clearly or make decisions when I'm in that state of mind.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, that's the benefit of having a wellness action plan. When we're feeling depressed, it can be difficult to remember what helps or to motivate ourselves to take action. Having a clear plan that you've created ahead of time can make it easier to take those first steps towards feeling better.\n\nLet's spend some time now creating your wellness action plan. We can start by identifying a few key people you can reach out to for support, like friends, family members, or a therapist. Then we can list some specific self-care activities that you know usually help your mood, like painting, walking, or anything else that feels nurturing to you. Finally, we can add any other strategies that you think might be helpful, like reviewing your coping cards or engaging in some relaxation exercises. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds really helpful. I'm feeling more hopeful knowing that I'll have a plan to follow if I start to struggle again.",
