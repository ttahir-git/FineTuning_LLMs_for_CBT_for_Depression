  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your homework from the last session. How did you find the experience of using your CBT toolbox, scheduling self-care activities, and reaching out for support?\n\nPatient: Using the CBT toolbox was helpful, especially on those difficult days. It reminded me that I have options and strategies to cope, even when things feel overwhelming. Scheduling self-care activities was a bit more challenging. I managed to take a walk and do some painting, but I struggled to prioritize self-care on busier days. As for reaching out for support, I texted a friend, and we had a good conversation. It felt nice to connect with someone, but I also felt a bit guilty for bothering them with my problems.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you were able to use your CBT toolbox and find some relief during those difficult moments. Prioritizing self-care can be challenging, especially when we have other responsibilities and commitments. Remember, self-care doesn't have to be time-consuming or elaborate. Even a few minutes of deep breathing or enjoying a cup of tea can make a difference. As for reaching out for support, it's common to feel guilty or like we're burdening others. But remember, your friends care about you and want to be there for you, just as you would for them. It's not a bother; it's a part of friendship and connection.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I guess I wouldn't mind if a friend reached out to me when they needed support. It's just hard to shake that feeling of being a burden sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's where our work in therapy comes in \u2013 challenging those negative thoughts and beliefs that hold us back from seeking support and connection. Speaking of our work together, I'd like to spend some time reviewing your overall progress and exploring how you can maintain your gains after our sessions end. One way to do this is by creating a relapse prevention plan. This plan will include strategies for managing potential setbacks and identifying early warning signs of depression. We can also discuss how you can continue to support yourself, such as accessing social support, engaging in self-care, and seeking professional help if needed. What are your thoughts on this?\n\nPatient: I think that sounds really helpful. I'm a bit nervous about ending therapy, but having a plan in place makes me feel more prepared. I definitely want to keep using the CBT tools and techniques we've discussed, and I like the idea of having a support system in place for when I need it.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel nervous about ending therapy. It's a big transition, and it's natural to have some concerns. That's why we'll work together to create a comprehensive plan that feels right for you. We can also discuss the possibility of scheduling periodic \"booster\" sessions in the future, just to check in and review your progress. Remember, you've made incredible strides in our work together, and you have the skills and tools to continue this journey of growth and healing.",
