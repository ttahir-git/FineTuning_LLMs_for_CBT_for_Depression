  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your thought records and positive data log. Can you share some of the entries you found most challenging?\n\nPatient: Sure. One situation that stood out was when I made a mistake at work last week. My automatic thought was, \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right.\" I had a hard time finding evidence against that thought.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging it can be to counter thoughts that feel so deeply true. Let's explore this together. What emotions did you feel when you had that thought?\n\nPatient: I felt really sad and hopeless, like I'd never be good enough at my job.\n\nTherapist: Those emotions make a lot of sense given the thought you had. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I did make that mistake at work. And I've made mistakes before. It feels like I'm just not cut out for this job.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so the evidence for the thought is the mistake you made and previous mistakes. Now, let's look for evidence against the thought. Have there been times at work when you've done things right or received positive feedback?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been times when I've done well. My boss complimented me on a project a few weeks ago. And I did get this job in the first place, so they must have seen something in me.\n\nTherapist: Great, so we have evidence that you've had successes at work and that your boss has recognized your abilities. What about outside of work? Are there areas of your life where you feel competent and capable?\n\nPatient: I suppose so. I've always done well in school, and I have hobbies that I enjoy and am good at, like painting and gardening.\n\nTherapist: So, we have evidence from multiple areas of your life that you are capable and skilled. How does this evidence impact your original thought, \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right\"?\n\nPatient: When I look at it that way, I guess the thought isn't entirely true. I have had successes, even if I don't always feel that way.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By examining the evidence for and against the thought, we can see that it's not completely accurate. A more balanced thought might be, \"I made a mistake, but that doesn't mean I'm a failure. I've had successes in the past and have skills and abilities that I can rely on.\"\n\nPatient: That does feel more balanced. It's hard to remember that in the moment, though.\n\nTherapist: It takes practice to challenge negative thoughts, especially when they're tied to strong emotions. That's why we work on it in therapy. With time, it will become easier to find a more balanced perspective. Let's keep practicing with some of your other thought record entries.",
