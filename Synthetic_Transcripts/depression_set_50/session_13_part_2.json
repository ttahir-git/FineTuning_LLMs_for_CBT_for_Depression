  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing the thought records you completed since our last session. Can you share one of the situations you recorded and walk me through the process of identifying your thoughts and emotions?\n\nPatient: Sure. One situation that stood out was when I received feedback from my supervisor on a project I had been working on. She pointed out a few areas that needed improvement, and I immediately felt overwhelmed and discouraged. My initial thoughts were, \"I'm not good enough,\" and \"I'll never be successful in this job.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Marcus. Those thoughts can be quite distressing. In your thought record, were you able to identify the emotions you experienced and their intensity?\n\nPatient: Yes, I wrote down that I felt sad, about 80%, and anxious, around 70%. I also felt a bit angry at myself for not doing better.\n\nTherapist: You did a great job capturing those emotions and their intensity. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm not good enough.\" What evidence did you come up with?\n\nPatient: Well, as evidence for the thought, I listed the feedback from my supervisor and the fact that I've been struggling to keep up with the workload lately. As evidence against the thought, I tried to remind myself of past successes and positive feedback I've received, but it was hard to think of examples in the moment.\n\nTherapist: It's common for the negative evidence to feel more salient when we're feeling down. That's where the positive data log can be helpful. Even if it's challenging, try to make a habit of recording any positive feedback, accomplishments, or moments of progress, no matter how small they may seem. Over time, you'll build up a collection of evidence that challenges the negative thoughts.\n\nRegarding the feedback from your supervisor, did you use the downward arrow technique to uncover any underlying beliefs?\n\nPatient: I tried, but I had trouble going beyond the initial thoughts. I kept coming back to \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'll never be successful.\"\n\nTherapist: That's okay. The downward arrow technique can take some practice. Let's try it together now. When you think, \"I'm not good enough,\" what does that mean to you? What would be the worst part of not being good enough?\n\nPatient: I guess it means that I'm not living up to expectations, both my own and others'. The worst part would be disappointing people and feeling like I'm not measuring up to my potential.\n\nTherapist: And what would it mean if you weren't living up to your potential?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not valuable or worthy. That my contributions don't matter.\n\nTherapist: So, it seems that underlying the thought \"I'm not good enough\" is the core belief \"I'm not valuable or worthy.\" Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that's a belief I've struggled with for a long time, even before starting this job.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant insight, Marcus. Identifying these core beliefs is an important step in the therapeutic process. As we continue our work together, we'll focus on challenging and reframing these beliefs, using techniques like the positive data log and cognitive restructuring.\n\nSpeaking of the positive data log, you mentioned earlier that you found it challenging to come up with evidence against your negative thoughts. Can you tell me more about what made it difficult?",
