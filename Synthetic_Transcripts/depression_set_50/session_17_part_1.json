  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I appreciate you sharing those limitations, Nova. It's good to be aware of them. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I tried the behavioral experiment we planned, where I engaged in a creative activity without aiming for perfection. It was challenging, but I did notice some interesting thoughts and emotions during the process.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you tried the behavioral experiment. Let's add that to our agenda for today, so we can discuss your experience in more detail. What else would you like to prioritize for our session today?\n\nPatient: I'd also like to talk more about the connection between my perfectionism and self-worth. It's something that's been on my mind a lot since our last session. And maybe we could discuss some strategies for managing my anxiety when it comes to creative activities.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on. So, our agenda for today includes:\n1. Discussing your experience with the behavioral experiment\n2. Exploring the connection between perfectionism and self-worth\n3. Strategies for managing anxiety related to creative activities\n\nBefore we dive into the agenda, let's do a more thorough check-in. How has your mood been since our last session? Have you noticed any changes in your depression symptoms?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. I've had some good days where I feel more motivated and connected to my passions, but I've also had days where I feel really down and struggle to get out of bed. I've been trying to use the thought stopping and self-compassion strategies we discussed, but it's not always easy.\n\nTherapist: It's common to have ups and downs, and it's great that you're noticing those patterns. We can definitely explore some additional strategies to help manage those difficult days. I'm curious, on the days when you feel more motivated and connected to your passions, what do you think contributes to that?\n\nPatient: I think it's usually when I give myself permission to just create without judgment. Like with the behavioral experiment, when I let go of the need to be perfect, I actually enjoy the process more. But it's hard to maintain that mindset consistently.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Marcus. It ties into our agenda item about the connection between perfectionism and self-worth. Let's start there and see if we can uncover some of the underlying beliefs that make it challenging to maintain that mindset consistently. Does that sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I'm ready to dive in.",
