  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I appreciate you sharing those limitations. It's good to be aware of them. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned, but it's been challenging. I've been feeling more down than usual, and it's been hard to find the motivation to do much of anything, let alone work on thought records and positive data logs.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it can be difficult to find motivation when you're feeling down. Let's explore that a bit more. Can you tell me more about what's been going on for you since our last session? What thoughts and emotions have you been experiencing?\n\nPatient: Well, work has been really stressful lately. I feel like I'm not meeting my own expectations or the expectations of my colleagues. I'm constantly worried that I'm going to make a mistake or that I'm not doing enough. It's been hard to focus on anything else, and I find myself getting caught up in negative thoughts about myself and my abilities.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stress and self-critical thoughts. I want to acknowledge how challenging that must be. Let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session, so we can make sure we're addressing your most pressing concerns. What would you like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to talk more about how to manage the stress and negative thoughts I've been experiencing. I also want to discuss how I can find the motivation to work on the homework assignments, even when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. We can definitely focus on strategies for managing stress and negative thoughts, as well as exploring ways to increase motivation for homework assignments. I'd also like to check in on your progress with the thought records and positive data log, and discuss how we can continue to challenge those intermediate and core beliefs related to perfectionism and self-worth. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think it's important to address all of those things.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's start by discussing the stress and negative thoughts you've been experiencing. Can you give me an example of a situation that triggered these thoughts and feelings?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I was working on a project at work, and I found myself getting really frustrated and overwhelmed. I started thinking things like \"I'm never going to get this right\" and \"Everyone is going to think I'm incompetent.\" It just spiraled from there, and I ended up feeling really down and hopeless.",
