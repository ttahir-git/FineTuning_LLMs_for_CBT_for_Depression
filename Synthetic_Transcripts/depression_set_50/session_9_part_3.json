  "transcript": "Patient: I feel a bit better now that we've identified the core belief, but I'm still not sure how to challenge it. It's been with me for so long.\n\nTherapist: Challenging core beliefs is a process, and it takes time and practice. One way to start is by examining the evidence for and against the belief, just like we did with your negative thoughts. We can also work on developing more balanced and compassionate beliefs about yourself. Another helpful technique is the positive data log, where you keep track of experiences that contradict your negative core belief. This can help you build evidence for a more adaptive belief over time.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I can start by paying attention to times when I do feel worthy or accomplished, even if they're small things.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Every piece of evidence counts, no matter how small. As you gather more evidence, it will become easier to challenge the negative core belief and develop a more balanced view of yourself. Remember, this is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I'll try to keep that in mind. I think I'm starting to feel a bit more hopeful about this whole therapy thing.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Marcus. Hope is a powerful thing, and it can help you stay motivated and engaged in the therapeutic process. Speaking of staying engaged, let's talk about your homework for this week. I'd like you to continue working on the thought records, focusing on challenging your negative thoughts and gathering evidence against your core belief. You can also start a positive data log to keep track of experiences that contradict the belief that you're worthless. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: It sounds like a lot of work, but I'm willing to give it a try. I know I need to put in the effort if I want to see changes.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Marcus. Therapy is a collaborative process, and the work you put in between sessions is just as important as the work we do together. Remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself as you navigate this process. Change takes time, but every small step counts.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best to remember that. Thanks for your support, Nova.",
