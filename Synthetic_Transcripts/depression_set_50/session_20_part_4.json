  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job creating your wellness action plan, Marcus. Let's review it together to make sure it feels comprehensive and doable for you.\n\nPatient: Okay, so my early warning signs are isolating myself, changes in sleep patterns, and an increase in negative thoughts. When I notice these signs, my plan is to:\n\n1. Reach out to my support system - I can text or call my friends, Alex or Sam, or my sister, Tanya.\n2. Engage in self-care activities - I'll try to do some painting, go for a walk, or listen to music.\n3. Use my CBT tools - I'll review my coping cards, complete a thought record, or do a relaxation exercise.\n4. If my symptoms persist or worsen, I'll schedule an appointment with a therapist or consider reaching out to my doctor.\n\nTherapist: That's a solid plan, Marcus. It includes a good balance of social support, self-care, and professional help if needed. Remember, this plan is a living document, and you can always update it as you learn more about what works for you.\n\nAs we wrap up our work together, I want to acknowledge the incredible progress you've made. You've worked hard to understand your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and you've developed a strong set of skills to manage your depression. I have full confidence in your ability to continue this work independently and to seek support when needed.\n\nWhat are your thoughts and feelings as we come to the end of our sessions together?\n\nPatient: I feel a mix of emotions. I'm proud of the progress I've made and grateful for your support and guidance. At the same time, I'm a bit nervous about continuing this work on my own. But having this wellness action plan and knowing that I can always reach out for help if needed makes me feel more confident.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions as we end our work together. It's a big transition, and it's okay to feel both proud and nervous. Remember, you've developed a strong foundation of skills and knowledge, and you have a clear plan for how to support yourself going forward.\n\nBefore we end our session, let's discuss your homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing your CBT skills, using your toolbox and wellness action plan as needed. I also encourage you to schedule at least one self-care activity and reach out to at least one supportive person. Finally, take some time to reflect on our work together and write down any insights or learnings you want to remember going forward.\n\nDoes this homework feel manageable for you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that feels manageable. I'll keep practicing my CBT skills and using my action plan. I'll also make sure to schedule some self-care and reach out to a friend. And I'll take some time to reflect on our work together.\n\nTherapist: Great, I'm glad that feels doable for you. Remember, you can always adjust your homework as needed based on your energy and schedule.\n\nAs we wrap up our final session, I want to reiterate how proud I am of the work you've done, Marcus. You've shown incredible courage, vulnerability, and dedication to your mental health and well-being. I have full faith in your ability to continue this work and to thrive. If you ever find yourself in need of additional support, please don't hesitate to reach out. My door is always open.\n\nTake care, Marcus. It's been an honor working with you.\n\nPatient: Thank you so much, Nova. Your support and guidance have meant the world to me. I feel more equipped to manage my depression and to live a fulfilling life. I'll miss our sessions, but I know I have the tools and the support system to keep moving forward.
