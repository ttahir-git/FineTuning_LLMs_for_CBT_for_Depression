  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great additions to your toolbox, Marcus. As we discussed earlier, having a variety of tools to turn to can be really helpful on difficult days. Let's talk more about how to manage those challenging moments when you're struggling to get out of bed.\n\nOne strategy is to start small and break things down into manageable steps. On those tough mornings, instead of thinking about the whole day ahead, focus on one small task you can do first, like sitting up in bed or drinking a glass of water. Once you've done that, move on to the next small step, like getting dressed or eating breakfast.\n\nAs you're taking these small steps, it can be helpful to use some of the tools in your CBT toolbox. You might look at your list of personal strengths or coping statements to help shift your mindset. Or you could do a quick deep breathing exercise to calm your body and mind.\n\nThe key is to be gentle with yourself and celebrate each small victory. Getting through a difficult day is a sign of strength and resilience, even if it doesn't feel like it in the moment.\n\nPatient: Starting small makes sense. I think I put too much pressure on myself to just \"snap out of it\" and have a productive day, even when I'm really struggling.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, and it's something we've been working on throughout our sessions \u2013 letting go of perfectionism and being kinder to yourself. Remember, having a difficult day doesn't mean you've failed or that you're not making progress. It's just part of the process of managing depression.\n\nAnother strategy for difficult days is to reach out for support when you need it. That might mean calling a friend or family member, or even just sending a text to let someone know you're having a tough time. You don't have to go through this alone.\n\nPatient: I'm not always good at reaching out. I don't want to burden other people with my problems.\n\nTherapist: I understand that concern, but I want to challenge that idea a bit. When you care about someone, you want to support them through hard times, right? The same is true for the people who care about you. Asking for help isn't a burden \u2013 it's an opportunity for others to show their love and support.\n\nOf course, it's also important to have a balance. You don't want to rely solely on others for your well-being. That's where your CBT toolbox comes in. It's about finding a combination of self-care and external support that works for you.\n\nPatient: I guess that makes sense. I have a couple of friends who I know would be there for me if I reached out.\n\nTherapist: That's great. Even just making a list of supportive people you can contact can be a helpful addition to your toolbox. You might not need to use it every time, but it's good to have it available.\n\nAs we start to wrap up our session today, I want to talk a bit about how to maintain your progress after our sessions end. One important thing is to keep practicing the skills you've learned, even on days when you're feeling okay. That way, they become more automatic and easier to use when you really need them.\n\nIt can also be helpful to schedule regular check-ins with yourself, maybe once a week or once a month, to assess how you're doing and what tools you might need to use more often.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of regular check-ins. It's like being my own therapist in a way.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! You've learned a lot of valuable skills in our sessions, and now it's about continuing to apply them in your daily life. Remember, progress isn't always linear. There will be ups and downs, and that's okay. What matters is that you keep moving forward and using your tools to cope with challenges as they arise.\n\nBefore we end today, let's assign some homework. I'd like you to continue working on your CBT toolbox, adding to it and practicing using the tools, especially on difficult days. I also want you to schedule at least one self-care activity this week, even if it's just for a few minutes.\n\nFinally, I'd like you to reach out to at least one supportive person this week, even if it's just a quick text to say hello. It's a small step towards building that external support system we talked about.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can do that. I'll keep working on my toolbox and try to reach out to a friend.\n\nTherapist: Great. Remember, our next session will be our last regular session, so we'll spend some time reviewing your progress and making a plan for moving forward. If you have any questions or concerns before then, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nHow are you feeling as we wrap up today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling okay. It's a lot to process, but I feel like I have some good tools to work with now.\n\nTherapist: You've made some really important insights today, Marcus. I'm confident that you have the skills and resilience to keep making progress, even after our sessions end. Remember, you don't have to do this perfectly. Just keep taking small steps forward, and reach out for support when you need it.\n\nThank you for your hard work today. I look forward to our final session next week.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate all your help.
