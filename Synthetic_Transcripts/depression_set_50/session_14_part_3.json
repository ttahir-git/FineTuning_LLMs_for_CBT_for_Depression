  "transcript": "Patient: I think I'm starting to understand how to challenge my negative thoughts better. It's just hard to do it in the moment when I'm feeling really down.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it can be challenging to apply these skills when you're feeling overwhelmed by strong emotions. That's why practice is so important. The more you work on challenging your thoughts, even when you're not in a low mood, the easier it will become to do it when you are struggling. Let's practice with another entry from your thought records.\n\nPatient: Okay, there was another situation where I felt really anxious about going to a social event. My automatic thought was, \"I won't fit in, and everyone will think I'm weird.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to work with. What emotions did you feel when you had that thought?\n\nPatient: I felt really anxious and nervous. I also felt a bit sad, like I wouldn't be accepted.\n\nTherapist: Those are understandable emotions given the thought you had. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I won't fit in, and everyone will think I'm weird.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've always been a bit of an introvert, and I've had experiences in the past where I felt like I didn't fit in. I guess that's why I assume it will happen again.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so past experiences of feeling like you didn't fit in are evidence for the thought. Now, let's look for evidence against the thought. Have there been times when you've gone to social events and felt like you did fit in or connected with others?\n\nPatient: I suppose there have been a few times when I've gone to events and ended up having a good conversation with someone or feeling like I clicked with a group of people.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought. It shows that even though you've had some experiences of not fitting in, there have also been times when you have connected with others. What about the second part of the thought, \"everyone will think I'm weird\"? Is there evidence against that?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess not everyone could think I'm weird. People have different opinions, and what seems weird to one person might not seem weird to another.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's unlikely that everyone would have the same opinion of you. By examining the evidence for and against the thought, we can see that it's not entirely accurate. A more balanced thought might be, \"I may have felt like I didn't fit in before, but there have also been times when I have connected with others. Not everyone will think I'm weird, and even if some people do, that doesn't mean there's something wrong with me.\"\n\nPatient: That does feel more balanced. It's hard to remember that in the moment, though, when I'm feeling really anxious.\n\nTherapist: It takes practice to challenge negative thoughts, especially when they're tied to strong emotions. One technique that can be helpful is to create coping cards with balanced thoughts like the one we just came up with. You can keep these cards with you and pull them out when you're feeling anxious or down, to remind yourself of the more balanced perspective.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I think I'll try that.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's keep practicing with some of your other thought record entries, and then we can discuss your experience with the behavioral experiment and social engagement goal.",
