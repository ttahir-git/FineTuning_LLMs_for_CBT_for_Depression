  "transcript": "Therapist: Marcus, you mentioned that you've been feeling down and struggling with the transition to your new job and city. I'd like to understand more about your experience. Can you tell me when you first started noticing these feelings of depression?\n\nPatient: It started about six months ago, not long after I moved to Atlanta for my new job. At first, I thought it was just the stress of adjusting to a new environment, but the feelings didn't go away. They just kept getting worse.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like this has been a challenging period for you. Aside from the move and your new job, have there been any other significant changes or events in your life that might have contributed to these feelings?\n\nPatient: Not really. I mean, my family and friends are all back home, so I don't have much of a support system here. But nothing else major has happened.\n\nTherapist: I see. Let's talk a bit more about your support system. You mentioned that your family and friends are back home. How often do you get to connect with them?\n\nPatient: I try to call my parents once a week, but it's hard with our schedules. And my friends, we text occasionally, but it's not the same as seeing them in person.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that the lack of in-person support is impacting you. Let's shift gears a bit and talk about your daily life. How have your sleeping and eating habits been lately?\n\nPatient: My sleep has been really messed up. I have trouble falling asleep, and then I wake up multiple times during the night. As for eating, I don't have much of an appetite. I've lost some weight because I just don't feel like eating.\n\nTherapist: Disruptions in sleep and appetite can be common symptoms of depression. I'd like to explore how these changes are affecting your mood and energy levels throughout the day. Can you walk me through a typical day for you, starting from when you wake up until you go to bed?\n\nPatient: Sure. I usually wake up around 6:30 AM, but I don't feel rested. I drag myself out of bed and get ready for work. I'm not really hungry, so I might grab a piece of fruit or something small. At work, I have trouble focusing, and I feel like I'm just going through the motions. I don't really engage with my coworkers much. After work, I go home, and I don't have the energy or motivation to do anything. I might watch some TV or scroll on my phone, but I don't enjoy it. I usually go to bed around 11 PM, but like I said, I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of fatigue and lack of enjoyment in your daily activities. I want to acknowledge that what you're going through is difficult, and it takes courage to share your experience with me. In our next session, we'll start to explore some strategies for managing these symptoms and improving your overall well-being. For now, I'd like to ask \u2013 have you ever experienced feelings like this before, or is this a new experience for you?\n\nPatient: I've had some ups and downs in the past, but never this bad. It's definitely a new experience for me.",
