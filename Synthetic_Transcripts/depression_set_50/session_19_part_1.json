  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session? I'm interested in hearing about your mood, experiences, and any changes you've noticed.\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've had some ups and downs. I had a few good days where I felt motivated and connected to my passions, but I also had a couple of difficult days where I struggled to get out of bed. I tried to use the thought records on those harder days, and I think they helped a bit. I also went for a run and did some painting, even though it was tough to get started.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you had some good days and were able to engage in activities you enjoy, like running and painting. It's also important to acknowledge the difficult days and the effort it took to use the thought records and self-care activities. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have ups and downs. What stood out to you most from our last session and the work you've been doing?\n\nPatient: I think the idea of creating a personalized CBT toolbox has been really helpful. It made me feel more empowered and like I have some strategies to turn to when things get tough. I've started working on it, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful that you've started working on your CBT toolbox. There's no one \"right\" way to create it \u2013 it's all about what works for you. We can definitely review what you've done so far and brainstorm additional ideas. Given what you've shared, what would you like to focus on in our session today?\n\nPatient: I'd like to review my CBT toolbox with you and get your feedback. I also want to talk more about how to manage those difficult days when I struggle to get out of bed. And maybe we could discuss how to keep making progress after our sessions end.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. Let's start with reviewing your CBT toolbox, then we can discuss strategies for managing difficult days, and finally, we'll explore how to maintain your progress after our sessions end. How does that sound for an agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. Where should we start?",
