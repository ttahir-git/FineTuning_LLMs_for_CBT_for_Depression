  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for our 18th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me so far. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the thought records and reframing negative thoughts. It's been challenging at times, but I think I'm starting to see some progress. I had a difficult conversation with my sister last week, which brought up a lot of emotions, but I tried to use the skills we've been working on to manage my reactions.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed, even though it hasn't been easy. It's great that you were able to apply these skills during your conversation with your sister. Can you tell me more about how that experience was for you and what thoughts and feelings came up?\n\nPatient: Well, my sister brought up some concerns about my decision to leave college and my current job situation. She said she worries about my future and thinks I'm not living up to my potential. It was hard to hear, and I started feeling really down on myself, thinking that maybe she's right and I'm just a failure.\n\nTherapist: That must have been a difficult conversation, and it's understandable that it brought up feelings of self-doubt and sadness. Let's explore this further. What evidence do you have that supports or refutes the idea that you're a failure?\n\nPatient: I guess when I look at it objectively, there is evidence that contradicts the idea that I'm a failure. I've managed to maintain a job despite my chronic illness, and I've been taking steps to prioritize my mental health and well-being. It's just hard to shake the feeling that I'm not doing enough or that I'm disappointing my family.\n\nTherapist: It's good that you're able to recognize the evidence that challenges the idea that you're a failure. It's also important to acknowledge that feelings of guilt and worry about disappointing others can be powerful, even when there's evidence to the contrary. Let's continue to work on reframing these negative thoughts and building self-compassion. For today's agenda, what would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing the feelings that come up when I have conversations like the one with my sister. It's hard not to get stuck in negative thought patterns, and I want to work on being kinder to myself in those moments.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal for today's session. We can explore some strategies for managing difficult emotions and practicing self-compassion when faced with challenging interactions. We can also review the thought record and reframing techniques to see how they can be applied in these situations. How does that sound?",
