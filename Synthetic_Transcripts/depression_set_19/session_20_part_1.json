  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you for our final scheduled session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few important things about our work together. As an AI therapist, I have some limitations, such as not being able to access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. Despite these limitations, I'm committed to supporting you to the best of my abilities. Do you have any questions or concerns about this?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being transparent about your limitations. I feel like we've made a lot of progress together, and I'm looking forward to our final session.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges?\n\nPatient: I've been feeling a mix of emotions, to be honest. I'm proud of the progress I've made, but I'm also a bit anxious about ending therapy. I worry about whether I'll be able to maintain the gains I've made on my own.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions as we approach the end of our scheduled sessions. I want to reassure you that you've developed a strong set of skills and tools that will help you maintain your progress. We'll spend some time today reviewing those tools and discussing strategies for managing any challenges that may arise in the future. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to review the coping strategies we've discussed and maybe create a plan for how to handle any setbacks or difficult emotions that might come up in the future.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea. We can also discuss how you can continue to support yourself after our sessions end, including accessing social support and engaging in self-care. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds perfect. I think having a clear plan will help ease some of my anxiety about ending therapy.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. We'll work together to create a comprehensive plan that feels manageable and empowering for you. Let's start by reviewing some of the key coping strategies we've discussed throughout our sessions. Which ones have been most helpful for you?",
