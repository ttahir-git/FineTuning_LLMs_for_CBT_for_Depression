  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for the CBT session:\n\nPatient: Sure, I can give you an example from a few days ago. I was feeling really down and had the thought, \"I'm never going to amount to anything.\" I started filling out the thought record, but I got stuck on the evidence against the thought. I couldn't think of anything to write down, and it just made me feel worse.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Emilio. It's not uncommon to struggle with identifying evidence against deeply held negative beliefs. When we're feeling down, it can be challenging to see alternative perspectives. Let's break this down a bit and see if we can generate some evidence together. What specific situation triggered that thought?\n\nPatient: I had just gotten off the phone with my mom. She was asking about my job and when I was planning to go back to school. I felt like she was disappointed in me, and that's when the thought popped into my head.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so the conversation with your mom was the trigger. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm never going to amount to anything.\" What evidence do you think supports that thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I didn't finish college, and I'm not working in the field I wanted to. I'm living alone, and I don't have many friends. I guess that's the main evidence.\n\nTherapist: I understand how those factors might contribute to that thought. Now, let's try to look at it from a different angle. What might be some evidence against the thought that you're never going to amount to anything?\n\nPatient: I guess I have accomplished some things. I did well in school before I left, and I've been able to support myself despite my health issues. And I have my online support group, even if it's not a huge social circle.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of evidence against the negative thought. You've demonstrated resilience and the ability to overcome challenges, which are significant accomplishments. Another piece of evidence might be the progress you've made in therapy so far. You've been consistently attending sessions and working on developing new skills, which shows a commitment to your personal growth.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess I haven't thought about it that way before. It's hard to see those things when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. When we're feeling depressed, it can be difficult to access evidence that contradicts our negative thoughts. That's why practicing the thought record technique is so important \u2013 it helps us build the skill of considering alternative perspectives, even when we're not feeling our best.\n\nPatient: It makes sense when you put it that way. I'll try to keep that in mind the next time I'm working on a thought record.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that resonates with you. As you continue practicing, it will become easier to generate evidence against negative thoughts. Remember, the goal isn't to dismiss your negative thoughts entirely but rather to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective.\n\nPatient: I think I'm starting to understand that better now. It's just going to take some practice.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's what we're here to work on together. Speaking of practice, let's revisit the behavioral activation homework we discussed last session. How has that been going for you?",
