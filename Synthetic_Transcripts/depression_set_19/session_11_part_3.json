  "transcript": "Patient: When it came to reaching out to someone, I just felt so overwhelmed and anxious. I kept thinking about how they might judge me or think I'm a burden.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel anxious about reaching out, especially when you're worried about how others might perceive you. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. What evidence do you have that your friends would judge you or see you as a burden?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I don't have any concrete evidence. It's more of a feeling I have, based on my own insecurities and past experiences.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. Our feelings can be powerful, but they're not always based on facts. This is where the thought record can be helpful. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought that your friends would judge you or see you as a burden. What might be some evidence against that thought?\n\nPatient: I suppose the fact that they've stuck by me through tough times before is evidence that they care about me. And when we do spend time together, they seem genuinely interested in how I'm doing.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Those are great examples of evidence against the thought that they would judge you or see you as a burden. It's important to consider that evidence when you're feeling anxious about reaching out. Another helpful technique is to think about what you would say to a friend in a similar situation. If a friend told you they were hesitant to reach out because they felt like a burden, what would you tell them?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that I care about them and want to support them, and that they're not a burden at all.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And it's likely that your friends would feel the same way about you. This is a great opportunity to practice \"acting as if\" - even if you don't fully believe it yet, you can act as if you believe that your friends care about you and want to support you. This might mean reaching out to them, even if it feels uncomfortable at first.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I need to practice taking my own advice and treating myself with the same compassion I would show a friend.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Emilio. Self-compassion is an important part of building a more balanced and healthy view of yourself. As we continue to work together, we'll keep practicing these techniques and exploring ways to challenge the negative thoughts and beliefs that contribute to your depression.\n\nIn our next session, I'd like to continue our work with thought records and \"acting as if,\" and explore some additional techniques for building self-compassion and challenging negative beliefs. For homework, I'd like you to try completing a thought record whenever you notice yourself feeling anxious or depressed, paying special attention to evidence against your negative thoughts. I'd also like you to practice \"acting as if\" in at least one social situation, whether that's reaching out to a friend or engaging in a social activity. How does that sound?",
