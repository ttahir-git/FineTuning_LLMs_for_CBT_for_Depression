  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made a great point about the challenges of applying these skills in the moment when emotions are running high. One strategy that can be helpful is to create coping cards with reminders of the adaptive thoughts and strategies we've been working on. These can be small cards that you keep with you and pull out when you need a reminder of the work we've been doing in therapy. What do you think about creating some coping cards together?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good idea. I think having something physical to refer to could be really helpful when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by identifying some of the key thoughts and strategies that you've found most helpful so far. What are some of the adaptive thoughts or reframes that have resonated with you?\n\nPatient: One thing that's stuck with me is the idea that my worth isn't defined by my job or my education. It's hard to remember that sometimes, but it does help to remind myself of it.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic thought to include on a coping card. We can write something like, \"My worth is not defined by my job or education. I am valuable and worthy no matter what.\" Are there any other thoughts or strategies that you'd like to include?\n\nPatient: Another thing that's been helpful is reminding myself that I'm doing the best I can with the challenges I face. It's easy to get down on myself, but when I step back and look at the bigger picture, I can see that I'm really trying.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. That's another great thought to include. We can write, \"I am doing the best I can with the challenges I face. My efforts and progress matter.\" What about some of the specific techniques we've practiced, like the thought record or the grounding exercise? Are there any reminders about these techniques that you'd like to include on your coping cards?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think having a reminder of the thought record steps could be helpful. Like, \"Situation, Emotions, Thoughts, Evidence, Reframe.\" Just having those key words might help me remember to go through the process when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea. We can definitely include a card with those key words. And what about the grounding exercise? Is there a simple phrase or reminder that could help you remember to use that technique when you're feeling overwhelmed?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"Focus on my senses. What can I see, hear, touch, smell, and taste right now?\" I think that could help bring me back to the present moment.\n\nTherapist: Perfect. We can create a card with that reminder about the grounding exercise. It's great that you're identifying specific strategies that work for you and finding ways to remind yourself of them in the moment.\n\nPatient: It feels good to have some concrete tools to use when things get tough. I'm hoping these coping cards will help me remember what we've been working on, even when I'm not in therapy.\n\nTherapist: I'm really glad to hear that. Remember, these coping cards are just one tool in your toolbox. You've been developing so many valuable skills throughout our work together, and I have full confidence in your ability to continue using these skills independently. As we start to think about our work coming to an end, I want to make sure we have a solid plan in place for how you can continue supporting yourself after therapy. What are some of the other tools or strategies that you want to make sure you keep using?",
