  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda you've proposed sounds good to me. I think focusing on those areas will be helpful. One thing I wanted to mention is that I've been struggling with feelings of worthlessness and guilt lately, especially when it comes to my family. I feel like I'm not living up to their expectations, and it's hard to shake those thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Emilio. Feelings of worthlessness and guilt can be very challenging to cope with, and it's common for family expectations to play a role in those emotions. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts you've been having related to your family's expectations and your sense of worth?\n\nPatient: Well, I often think that I'm a disappointment to my family because I didn't finish college and I'm not as successful as they wanted me to be. I feel like I've let them down, and that makes me feel guilty and worthless. Even though I know they love me, I can't help but feel like I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you opening up about these thoughts and feelings. It's clear that your family's expectations have had a significant impact on your self-perception. I want to acknowledge that these thoughts are very painful, and it's understandable that you're struggling with them. Let's take a closer look at these thoughts using the thought record technique we've been practicing. Can you identify a specific situation or trigger that led to these thoughts about being a disappointment to your family?\n\nPatient: I think it happens most often when I'm talking to my parents on the phone. They always ask about my job and my future plans, and I feel like I don't have much to tell them. That's when the thoughts about being a disappointment and not being good enough start to creep in.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Emilio. Let's use that situation to fill out a thought record. We'll start with the first column, which is the date, time, and situation. Can you briefly describe the most recent phone call with your parents that triggered these thoughts?\n\nPatient: Sure. It was last Sunday evening, around 7 pm. My parents called to check in on me, and they asked how work was going and if I had any plans for the future. I told them that work was okay, but I didn't have any major plans or goals at the moment. That's when I started feeling like a disappointment.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have the situation: \"Sunday evening, 7 pm, phone call with parents discussing work and future plans.\" Now, let's move on to the emotions column. What emotions did you experience during and after the phone call, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt sad, guilty, and worthless. The sadness was probably around 80, the guilt was 90, and the worthlessness was 95.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for identifying those emotions and their intensities. It's clear that this situation had a significant emotional impact on you. Now, let's move on to the automatic thoughts column. What specific thoughts went through your mind during and after the phone call that might have contributed to these emotions?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I'm a disappointment to my parents,\" \"I'm not living up to their expectations,\" and \"I'm not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are powerful thoughts, Emilio. Let's focus on the thought \"I'm a disappointment to my parents\" and explore the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I didn't finish college like they wanted me to, and I'm not working in a high-paying or prestigious job. I also don't have a clear plan for my future, and I know they worry about me.\n\nTherapist: I understand how those factors might lead you to believe that you're a disappointment to your parents. Now, let's look for evidence against this thought. What are some reasons why your parents might not see you as a disappointment?\n\nPatient: I guess they still call me every week to check in, and they always tell me they love me. They also helped me out financially when I was going through a tough time, so they must care about me on some level.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're a disappointment to your parents. Their consistent communication, expressions of love, and financial support suggest that they do care about you and value your relationship, regardless of your job or education status. Now, let's generate an alternative thought based on the evidence we've discussed. What's a more balanced way to view this situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"Even though I haven't met all of my parents' expectations, they still love and support me, and that's what really matters.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful alternative thought, Emilio. It acknowledges the reality of the situation while also recognizing the evidence that contradicts the initial negative thought. Now, let's re-rate the intensity of your emotions based on this new perspective. How intense are the feelings of sadness, guilt, and worthlessness now, on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: The sadness is probably around 50 now, the guilt is 60, and the worthlessness is 65.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant decrease in intensity for all three emotions. This shows how powerful it can be to examine the evidence and generate alternative thoughts. As we continue practicing this technique, it will become easier to challenge negative thoughts and find more balanced perspectives.",
