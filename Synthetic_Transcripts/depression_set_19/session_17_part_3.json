  "transcript": "Patient: A more balanced thought might be, \"Even though some family members are critical of me, there are others who do support and accept me for who I am.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframing of the original thought, Emilio. It acknowledges the challenges you face with certain family members while also recognizing the support you have from others. How does this new thought impact the emotions you were feeling during the conversation with your sister?\n\nPatient: When I think about it that way, the sadness and hopelessness feel a bit less intense. Maybe the sadness goes down to a 6 out of 10, and the hopelessness to a 5.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, Emilio. It shows how reframing our thoughts can have a real impact on our emotions. I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in using these techniques, even when it's challenging.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. It's not easy, but I do feel like I'm starting to understand how my thoughts influence my emotions and behaviors.\n\nTherapist: You're doing a great job, Emilio. As we continue to practice these skills, it will become easier to catch and reframe those negative thoughts in the moment. Speaking of practicing, let's take a look at some of the thought records you've been working on since our last session. Can you share an example of a thought record you found particularly helpful or challenging?",
