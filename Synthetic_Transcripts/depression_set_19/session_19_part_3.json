  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job creating your relapse prevention plan. Having this written out will be a helpful resource for you to refer back to if you start noticing any of those early warning signs.\n\nPatient: Thanks, I agree. It feels good to have a plan in place. I'm feeling more confident about managing things on my own now.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that. Remember, confidence is key when it comes to maintaining your progress. You've worked hard to develop these skills, and you can trust in your ability to use them when you need to.\n\nPatient: I guess I'm still a little worried about what will happen if I do start to struggle again. What if I can't handle it on my own?\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern. It's normal to feel some anxiety about the future, especially after investing so much time and effort into your mental health. But remember, struggling doesn't mean you've failed. It's just a sign that you might need some extra support.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I guess I don't have to do everything perfectly all the time.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Recovery isn't about perfection, it's about progress. And part of that progress is learning to recognize when you need help and reaching out for it. That's a strength, not a weakness.\n\nPatient: I never thought about it that way before. It takes strength to ask for help when you need it.\n\nTherapist: It absolutely does. And you've already shown that strength by coming to therapy and doing this work. You have the tools and the support you need to keep moving forward, even if there are bumps along the way.\n\nPatient: Thanks, that's really encouraging to hear. I feel like I have a better perspective on things now.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. In addition to your support system and your coping strategies, you can always come back for booster sessions if you need a refresher or some extra guidance.\n\nPatient: That's good to know. I might take you up on that if I need to.\n\nTherapist: Please do. I'm here to support you, even after our regular sessions end. You've made amazing progress, and I have complete faith in your ability to continue that progress on your own. But if you ever need a little extra help, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you for everything you've done for me. I really appreciate it.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. It's been an honor to work with you and see your growth over these past 19 sessions. I'm excited to see where you go from here.",
