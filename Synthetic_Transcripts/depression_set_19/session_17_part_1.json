  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the thought records and reframing negative beliefs. It's been challenging at times, but I do feel like I'm starting to notice some patterns in my thinking. I had a difficult conversation with my sister this week that left me feeling pretty down.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you've been practicing the techniques, even though it hasn't been easy. I'm here to support you through those challenges. I'd like to explore the conversation with your sister further, as it seems to have had a significant impact on your mood. Before we dive into that, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize in our time together?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to talk more about the conversation with my sister and how it's affecting me. I also want to review some of the thought records I've been working on and get your feedback. And maybe we could discuss some strategies for managing the overwhelming emotions that come up when I'm trying to reframe my negative beliefs.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a productive agenda, Emilio. Let's start by exploring the conversation with your sister. Can you tell me more about what happened and what thoughts and emotions came up for you during and after the interaction?",
