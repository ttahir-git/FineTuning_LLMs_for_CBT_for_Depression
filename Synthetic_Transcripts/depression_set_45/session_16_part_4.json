  "transcript": "Therapist: That's a great start, Mei. Even small pieces of positive evidence can help challenge negative beliefs about yourself. As we continue practicing the Positive Data Log, it will become easier to identify and record positive experiences and feedback.\n\nNow, let's explore how the techniques we've been working on can be applied to your specific goals. One of your goals is to expand your social support network and engage in meaningful activities. How do you think thought records, cognitive restructuring, and positive activity scheduling can help you work towards this goal?\n\nPatient: I think these techniques can help me challenge the negative thoughts that hold me back from reaching out to others. By practicing cognitive restructuring, I can remind myself that I don't need to be perfect to connect with people. And positive activity scheduling can help me prioritize social activities and hobbies that bring me joy and a sense of connection.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent insight, Mei. These techniques can definitely support you in expanding your social support network and engaging in meaningful activities. As you continue to practice them, you'll likely find it easier to challenge negative thoughts and prioritize activities that align with your values and goals.\n\nAnother goal you mentioned is cultivating a stronger sense of self-worth and purpose outside of your professional identity. How do you think the skills you're learning in therapy can help you work towards this goal?\n\nPatient: I think the Positive Data Log can help me recognize my strengths and accomplishments outside of work. And cognitive restructuring can help me challenge the belief that my worth is tied to my professional achievements. By focusing on my values and the things that bring me joy and purpose, I can start to build a more balanced sense of self-worth.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful point, Mei. Recognizing your strengths and challenging the belief that your worth is tied to your professional achievements is a crucial step in cultivating a stronger sense of self-worth and purpose. As you continue to practice these techniques, you'll likely find that your sense of self-worth becomes more balanced and less dependent on external factors.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, I want to check in with you about your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling more hopeful after today's session. I can see how these techniques can help me work towards my goals and manage my depressive symptoms. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful, Mei. It's true that therapy is not always easy, but the progress you're making is a testament to your hard work and dedication. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and there may be ups and downs along the way. But by continuing to practice these techniques and engage in therapy, you're taking important steps towards improving your overall well-being.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing thought records, focusing on challenging perfectionistic thoughts related to your goals. I also encourage you to schedule at least one positive activity that aligns with your values and brings you a sense of joy or connection. Finally, keep using the Positive Data Log to gather evidence that supports more balanced and adaptive beliefs about yourself and your abilities.\n\nIn our next session, we'll review your experience with the homework assignments and continue exploring how the techniques we've been working on can support you in reaching your goals. We'll also introduce additional CBT techniques as needed to build on your progress in managing depressive symptoms and improving overall well-being.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  1.
