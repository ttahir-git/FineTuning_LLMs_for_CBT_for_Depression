It's not an easy process, but your dedication and effort are making a difference in managing your depressive symptoms and improving your overall well-being.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a challenging journey, but I feel like I'm starting to see some improvements in my thoughts and behaviors.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Mei. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and there may be setbacks along the way. What matters is that you continue to practice the techniques and remain committed to your growth and well-being.\n\nBefore we end today's session, let's do a quick check-in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but overall, I'm in a better place than when we started the session. I'm grateful for the tools you've given me to work on my thoughts and beliefs.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling better and finding the tools helpful. Remember to be kind and compassionate with yourself as you continue this work.\n\nNow, let's discuss your homework for the coming week. In addition to continuing with the Positive Data Log and practicing the downward arrow technique, I'd like you to try cognitive restructuring whenever you notice yourself having negative thoughts related to your core belief of being incompetent and unworthy. Write down the original thought, the evidence for and against it, and generate a more balanced thought. Bring these examples to our next session so we can discuss them further.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll do my best to keep practicing these techniques and bring some examples next time.\n\nTherapist: Great! I'm looking forward to seeing your progress. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns between sessions, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you throughout this process.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  1.
