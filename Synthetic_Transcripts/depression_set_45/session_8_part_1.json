  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for our eighth session together. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say, as I can't directly observe non-verbal cues. If you ever feel I've misunderstood you, please let me know so we can clarify. Lastly, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a mental health emergency, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services immediately.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations and appreciate your transparency. I'm happy to clarify if there's any confusion.\n\nTherapist: Thank you, Mei. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been doing alright. I've been trying to practice the techniques we've discussed, like the thought records and mindfulness exercises. It's been challenging at times, but I do feel like I'm making some progress. I still struggle with feelings of loneliness and worthlessness, but I'm trying to be patient with myself.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some progress, even if it feels slow at times. It's completely normal to still experience those difficult emotions as you work through this process. Remember to give yourself credit for the efforts you're making. Can you share a bit more about your experience with the thought records? Were there any specific situations where you found it helpful to challenge negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: One situation that comes to mind is when I was working on a woodworking project and made a mistake. My initial thought was, \"I'm so incompetent. I can't even get this simple project right.\" But then I tried to challenge that thought by looking at the evidence. I reminded myself of all the successful projects I've completed in the past and acknowledged that everyone makes mistakes sometimes. It helped me reframe the situation and not be so hard on myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of using the thought record effectively, Mei! You did a wonderful job of identifying the negative thought, examining the evidence, and coming up with a more balanced perspective. It's so important to recognize that making mistakes is a normal part of the learning process and doesn't define your overall competence or worth.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's still a work in progress, but I'm trying to be more mindful of my thoughts and challenge them when needed.\n\nTherapist: You're doing an excellent job, Mei. As we continue our work together, it will become more natural to catch and reframe those negative thoughts. Now, let's set an agenda for today's session. We can review your experience with the homework assignments, explore the connections between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and discuss your progress in reaching out to supportive friends or family members. Is there anything else you'd like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I would also like to discuss some strategies for managing my perfectionism, as I feel like it's been holding me back in some areas of my life.",
