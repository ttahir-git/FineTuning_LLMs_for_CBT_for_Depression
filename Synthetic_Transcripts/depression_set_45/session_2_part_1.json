  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for our second session. Thank you for providing the summary from our last meeting. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. However, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities within these constraints. \n\nBefore we dive in, I want to set an agenda for our session today. We'll start by reviewing the homework I assigned last time, which was to keep a thought record. Then, I'll introduce the CBT framework and how it relates to the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We'll explore some of your specific thought patterns that may be contributing to your depression. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm looking forward to discussing my thought record and learning more about CBT.",
