  "transcript": "Patient: I've been using the thought record technique regularly since our last session. One challenge I've faced is identifying the evidence against my negative thoughts. Sometimes, it feels like all the evidence supports the negative thoughts, and it's hard to come up with alternative perspectives.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Mei. It's common to struggle with finding evidence against negative thoughts, especially when we've been thinking in a certain way for a long time. One strategy that can be helpful is to imagine what you might say to a friend who was in a similar situation and had the same thoughts. We often have an easier time being objective and compassionate with others than we do with ourselves. Can you think of a specific thought you've had trouble challenging, and we can work through it together?",
