  "transcript": "Patient: I'll try to keep that in mind as I work on my woodworking project this week. It's just hard to break out of that perfectionistic mindset sometimes.\n\nTherapist: I understand, Mei. Challenging perfectionistic thoughts and beliefs takes practice and persistence. One technique that can be helpful is to use a continuum instead of all-or-nothing thinking. For example, instead of seeing your woodworking project as either perfect or a failure, try to view it on a spectrum. There may be aspects that turn out well and others that could be improved, but that doesn't mean the entire project is a failure. What do you think about that perspective?\n\nPatient: It makes sense logically, but it's hard to internalize that way of thinking. I've been operating on this perfectionistic mindset for so long.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid point, Mei. Changing long-held beliefs and thought patterns is a process, and it takes time and practice. Another helpful technique is to consider what you would say to a friend or loved one in a similar situation. Would you hold them to the same perfectionistic standards that you hold yourself to?\n\nPatient: No, I would probably be more understanding and supportive of their efforts, even if the outcome wasn't perfect.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Mei. Practicing self-compassion and extending the same understanding and support to yourself that you would offer to others can be a powerful way to counteract perfectionism. As you work on your woodworking project this week, try to notice any perfectionistic thoughts that arise and practice responding to them with self-compassion and a more balanced perspective.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best. It's helpful to have these techniques to fall back on when I start getting stuck in that perfectionistic mindset.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find the techniques helpful, Mei. Remember that it's a process, and every small step counts. In addition to practicing self-compassion and using a continuum to challenge all-or-nothing thinking, another helpful strategy is to focus on the process and progress rather than just the outcome. Celebrate the effort you put in and the skills you're developing, even if the final product isn't perfect. What do you think about that approach?\n\nPatient: It's a different way of looking at things, but I can see how it could be beneficial. Focusing on the process and progress might help me stay motivated and engaged, even when I encounter challenges or setbacks.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Mei. By valuing the process and progress, you can maintain a sense of accomplishment and self-efficacy, even when things don't go perfectly. This can help counteract feelings of worthlessness and lack of motivation. As you work on your woodworking project this week, try to notice and celebrate the small victories and progress you make along the way, rather than just focusing on the end result.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's a different mindset than I'm used to, but I can see how it could be helpful in the long run.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're open to trying new approaches, Mei. Remember that changing thought patterns and beliefs takes time and practice, so be patient and compassionate with yourself as you work on developing these new skills. In addition to the woodworking project, are there any other areas of your life where you could practice challenging perfectionism and focusing on process and progress?\n\nPatient: I think I could apply these concepts to my social interactions, like the behavioral experiment we discussed earlier. Instead of putting pressure on myself to be perfect in social situations, I could focus on the progress I'm making and the effort I'm putting in to challenge my negative beliefs.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent point, Mei. Applying these concepts to your social interactions can help you build confidence and reduce anxiety over time. Remember to start small and celebrate the progress you make, even if it's just initiating a conversation or attending a social event without putting too much pressure on yourself to be perfect. As you continue to practice these skills, you'll likely find that your negative beliefs about social situations become less intense and less frequent.",
