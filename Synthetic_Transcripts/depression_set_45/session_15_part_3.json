  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great progress in challenging negative thoughts and setting achievable goals, Mei. I want to introduce another technique that can help you build on this progress. It's called the \"Positive Activity Scheduling.\" The idea is to intentionally schedule activities that bring you a sense of pleasure, mastery, or connection with others. This can help improve your mood and overall well-being. What do you think about giving it a try?\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. Can you give me an example of how it works?\n\nTherapist: Sure! Let's say you enjoy painting, but you haven't made time for it lately. With Positive Activity Scheduling, you would intentionally set aside time in your week to engage in painting, even if it's just for a short period. The key is to choose activities that bring you joy, a sense of accomplishment, or social connection. By scheduling these activities regularly, you can start to shift your focus away from negative thoughts and feelings and towards more positive experiences.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I can think of a few activities I enjoy but haven't made time for recently, like going for walks in nature or calling a friend.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples, Mei! I encourage you to make a list of activities that bring you pleasure, mastery, or connection. Then, try to schedule at least one of these activities into your week. Start small and build up gradually. Remember, the goal is to create more opportunities for positive experiences in your life.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely give it a try. It might be challenging at first, but I can see how it could help improve my mood.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Mei. Remember, it's okay if it feels challenging at first. Like any new skill, it takes practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate each small step you take towards incorporating more positive activities into your life.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and encouragement.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mei. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, the skills you're learning in therapy are tools you can use to manage your depressive symptoms and improve your overall well-being. It's not always easy, but with practice and persistence, you can create lasting positive changes in your life.",
