  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by discussing the CBT framework and how it relates to the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In CBT, we recognize that these three elements are closely interconnected and influence each other. For example, if you have the thought \"I'm not good enough,\" it might lead to feelings of sadness or worthlessness, which in turn could cause you to withdraw from activities or social interactions. This withdrawal might then reinforce the initial thought, creating a cycle. Does this make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes, I can see how that cycle might apply to my own experiences. When I'm working on a project and it's not going well, I often think \"I'm not capable of doing this anymore.\" That thought makes me feel frustrated and disappointed in myself, and sometimes I just give up on the project entirely.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. These types of negative thought patterns are what we call cognitive distortions. They're inaccurate or exaggerated ways of thinking that can contribute to feelings of depression. Some common cognitive distortions include all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, and jumping to conclusions. Let's look at your thought record and see if we can identify any cognitive distortions that might be at play.\n\nPatient: Okay, I noticed that when I was working on a particularly challenging woodworking project last week, I had the thought \"I'll never be able to complete this.\" That felt overwhelming and discouraging.\n\nTherapist: That's a great catch. The thought \"I'll never be able to complete this\" is an example of fortune-telling, which is when we predict a negative outcome without evidence. It's also a bit of all-or-nothing thinking, as it doesn't leave room for the possibility that you might be able to complete the project with more time or support. How do you think this thought impacted your feelings and actions in that moment?\n\nPatient: It made me feel really defeated, like there was no point in even trying. I ended up putting the project aside and didn't work on it again for several days.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. When we have thoughts like that, it can be really difficult to motivate ourselves to keep going. One CBT technique we can use in these situations is to challenge the negative thought by looking for evidence that contradicts it. In this case, you could remind yourself of past projects you've completed successfully, or break the project down into smaller steps that feel more manageable. How do you think that might have changed your experience in that moment?",
