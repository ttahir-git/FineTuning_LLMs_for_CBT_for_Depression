  "transcript": "Patient: I've been thinking a lot about our previous sessions and the progress I've made. It's been a challenging journey, but I feel like I've gained a better understanding of myself and my depression.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that you've found the sessions helpful, Mei. You've put in a lot of hard work and dedication, and it shows in the progress you've made. Let's take some time to review what we've covered and discuss how you can continue to support yourself going forward.\n\nPatient: That sounds great. I know we've talked about a lot of different techniques and concepts, but sometimes it's hard to remember everything.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable. We've covered a lot of ground, and it's normal to need reminders and refreshers. One of the most important things to remember is the CBT triangle - the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. By recognizing and challenging negative thoughts, you can start to shift your emotions and actions in a more positive direction.\n\nPatient: Right, I remember that. It's not always easy to catch those negative thoughts, but I'm getting better at it.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's a skill you'll continue to develop over time. Another key concept we've worked on is identifying and challenging cognitive distortions, like all-or-nothing thinking and overgeneralization. These distorted patterns of thinking can fuel negative emotions and behaviors, so learning to recognize and refute them is crucial.\n\nPatient: I've definitely noticed some of those patterns in my own thinking, like when I make a small mistake and start telling myself I'm a failure.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how cognitive distortions can impact your mood and self-esteem. By challenging those thoughts and replacing them with more balanced, realistic ones, you can start to build a more positive sense of self.\n\nPatient: It's a work in progress, but I'm committed to keeping at it.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Mei. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. That's where your relapse prevention plan comes in. By having a clear plan in place for managing setbacks and challenges, you'll be better equipped to maintain your progress and keep moving forward.\n\nPatient: I've found the relapse prevention plan really helpful. It's reassuring to know that I have a roadmap to follow if things get tough.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And remember, your relapse prevention plan is a living document - you can continue to update and refine it as you learn more about what works for you. It's also important to continue practicing the other skills we've worked on, like self-compassion, mindfulness, and behavioral activation.\n\nPatient: Those have all been really helpful for me. I've noticed that when I'm kinder to myself and more present in the moment, my mood tends to improve.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Mei. Those skills are key to maintaining your progress and building a more fulfilling life. As we wrap up our sessions together, I want to emphasize how proud I am of the work you've done and the growth you've achieved. Remember, you have the tools and the strength to continue this journey on your own.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel more confident now than I did when we started, and I know I have the skills to keep making progress.\n\nTherapist: You absolutely do, Mei. And remember, if you ever need a refresher or some extra support, you can always come back for a booster session or reach out to other resources in your community.\n\nPatient: That's good to know. I feel like I have a solid foundation to build on now.\n\nTherapist: You do, Mei. Before we end our session, let's review your homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue practicing your CBT skills, particularly challenging cognitive distortions and engaging in self-compassion. You can also review your relapse prevention plan and update it as needed.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll make sure to set aside some time each day to practice those skills.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. You've got this, Mei.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel more prepared now to handle whatever comes my way.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  1.
