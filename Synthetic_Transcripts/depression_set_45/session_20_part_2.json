  "transcript": "Patient: I've been thinking about what you said earlier, about celebrating my accomplishments. It's hard for me to do that, to really acknowledge my progress. I feel like I'm always focused on what I still need to work on, rather than what I've already achieved.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Mei, and it's something we can definitely work on together. Acknowledging your progress and celebrating your accomplishments is an important part of the therapeutic process. It helps to reinforce the positive changes you've made and build your confidence in your ability to continue making progress.\n\nPatient: I understand that logically, but emotionally, it's a struggle. I feel like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, like any progress I've made is temporary or not real.\n\nTherapist: That's a common fear, Mei, and it's something we can explore further. Let's start by looking at the evidence. Can you think of a specific accomplishment or positive change you've made during our work together that feels real and lasting?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose one thing is that I'm more aware of my negative thoughts and self-critical beliefs now. I catch myself more often when I'm being hard on myself, and I try to challenge those thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example, Mei! Increasing your awareness and challenging negative thoughts is a significant accomplishment. It's a skill that takes practice and persistence, and the fact that you're doing it regularly is a clear sign of progress. How does it feel to acknowledge that?\n\nPatient: It feels good, I guess. I mean, it's still hard to fully believe it sometimes, but I can see that I've made some real changes in how I think about myself.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Mei. And it's okay if it feels hard to fully believe sometimes. That's where the practice of self-compassion comes in. When you notice yourself doubting your progress, see if you can offer yourself some kindness and understanding, just as you would to a good friend who was struggling.\n\nPatient: I'll try. It's just such a deeply ingrained habit, you know? Being critical of myself.\n\nTherapist: I completely understand. And the fact that you're willing to try, even when it's difficult, is another sign of your strength and resilience. Remember, every time you practice self-compassion, you're reinforcing a new, more adaptive way of relating to yourself. It's like building a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it gets.\n\nPatient: That's a good way of looking at it. I guess I just need to keep practicing, even when it feels uncomfortable.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And remember, you don't have to do it alone. You have your coping card, your relapse prevention plan, and all the other tools and strategies we've developed together. And even after our sessions end, you can always come back to these tools and use them to support yourself.\n\nPatient: That's reassuring. I know I've made progress, and I want to keep building on it. I just need to trust myself more, I think.\n\nTherapist: Trusting yourself is a great goal, Mei. And it's something that develops over time, with practice and experience. Every time you use your coping skills, challenge a negative thought, or offer yourself compassion, you're building that trust in yourself. You're showing yourself that you have the strength and resilience to handle whatever challenges come your way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. That means a lot to hear you say that. I feel like I'm starting to believe it more, even if I'm not fully there yet.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Mei. And remember, it's not about being \"fully there\" - it's about being on the journey, and taking steps in the right direction. Every step counts, no matter how small it might seem. And every step is an opportunity to practice self-compassion and build trust in yourself.",
