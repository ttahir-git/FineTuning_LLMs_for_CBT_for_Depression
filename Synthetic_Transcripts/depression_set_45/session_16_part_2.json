  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's dive deeper into how perfectionism shows up in your life, Mei. Can you give me some examples of situations where you notice perfectionistic thoughts and behaviors?\n\nPatient: Well, it's not just with my woodworking projects. I often feel like I need to be the perfect parent, friend, and even the perfect patient in therapy. I set very high standards for myself, and when I can't meet them, I feel like a failure.\n\nTherapist: It's common for perfectionism to show up in multiple areas of our lives. It sounds like these high standards are causing you a lot of distress. Let's explore the impact of these perfectionistic thoughts on your emotions and behaviors. How do you feel when you can't meet those standards?\n\nPatient: I feel anxious, frustrated, and sometimes even hopeless. I often end up avoiding tasks altogether because I'm afraid of not doing them perfectly. It's like I'm paralyzed by the fear of failure.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Mei. The anxiety and avoidance you're describing are common consequences of perfectionism. These feelings can create a cycle that's difficult to break. Let's look at how we can start challenging these perfectionistic thoughts using the thought record technique we've been practicing.\n\nThink back to a recent situation where perfectionism led to avoidance. What was the situation, and what thoughts came up for you?\n\nPatient: Last week, I wanted to reach out to a friend I haven't seen in a while. But I kept putting it off because I was worried about saying the wrong thing or not being interesting enough. I thought, \"If I can't be the perfect friend, why bother reaching out at all?\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Mei. Let's use the thought record to examine that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you need to be a perfect friend in order to reach out?\n\nPatient: Well, I don't have any concrete evidence. It's more of a feeling. I guess I assume that if I'm not perfect, my friend will judge me or reject me.\n\nTherapist: That's a common fear, but let's look at the evidence against that thought. Have you had experiences where you were less than perfect, but your friends still accepted and valued you?\n\nPatient: Now that I think about it, yes. I've had times when I made mistakes or wasn't at my best, but my true friends stuck by me. They didn't expect me to be perfect.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the perfectionistic thought. It shows that you don't need to be perfect to be a good friend or to be valued by others. Let's come up with an alternative, more balanced thought based on this evidence.\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought would be, \"I don't need to be a perfect friend to reach out and connect with others. My true friends accept me as I am, imperfections and all.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful alternative thought, Mei. It challenges the perfectionism and opens up the possibility of connecting with others without the pressure of being perfect. How do you feel when you consider this new perspective?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit lighter, actually. It takes some of the pressure off. I can see how this thought record technique can help me challenge my perfectionism in different situations.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Mei. Practicing the thought record regularly can help you build the skill of challenging perfectionistic thoughts and developing more balanced, compassionate ways of thinking. As we continue our work together, we'll explore more strategies for managing perfectionism and reducing its impact on your life.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and review your experience with the positive activity scheduling homework. How did that go for you?",
