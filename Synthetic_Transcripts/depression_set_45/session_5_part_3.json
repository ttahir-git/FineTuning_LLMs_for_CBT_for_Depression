  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying to practice the thought recording technique, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. Sometimes I get stuck on the evidence against my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge when learning this technique. Let's walk through an example together, and I can provide some guidance. Can you share a recent situation where you had a negative thought?\n\nPatient: Sure. Yesterday, I was supposed to meet a friend for lunch, but she canceled at the last minute. I immediately thought, \"She doesn't really want to spend time with me. I'm not important to her.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's start by identifying the emotion you felt in that situation and rating its intensity on a scale of 0-100.\n\nPatient: I felt really sad and rejected. I'd say the intensity was around 85.\n\nTherapist: Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"She doesn't really want to spend time with me. I'm not important to her.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, she canceled our plans at the last minute, and she didn't seem very apologetic about it.
