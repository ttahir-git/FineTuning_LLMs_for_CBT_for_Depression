  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing relatively well. I've been using my coping card and implementing my relapse prevention plan, which has helped me manage my depressive symptoms. However, I've noticed that my perfectionism still creeps up on me at times, especially when I'm working on my DIY projects.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been using your coping card and relapse prevention plan, and that they've been helpful in managing your depressive symptoms. Perfectionism can be a challenging habit to break, but the fact that you're aware of it is an important first step. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you noticed your perfectionism affecting you?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I was working on a woodworking project, and I made a small mistake. Instead of shrugging it off, I found myself getting frustrated and self-critical. I started thinking, \"I should be better at this by now\" and \"If I can't even get this right, what does that say about me?\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Mei. It's a great opportunity for us to practice some of the skills we've been working on. When you noticed those self-critical thoughts, were you able to use any of the techniques we've discussed, like cognitive restructuring?\n\nPatient: I did try to challenge those thoughts. I reminded myself that everyone makes mistakes and that one small error doesn't define my entire worth or skill set. It helped a little, but I still found myself feeling frustrated and down on myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great start, Mei. Challenging those thoughts is an important step, but it's also normal for the feelings to linger. That's where some of our other techniques, like self-compassion and mindfulness, can be helpful. Remember, the goal isn't to get rid of those thoughts and feelings entirely, but to change our relationship with them.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just get frustrated with myself for still having those thoughts and feelings, even after all the work we've done.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience, Mei. Our thoughts and feelings are deeply ingrained patterns, and it takes time and practice to shift them. The fact that you're noticing these patterns and making an effort to change them is a huge accomplishment. Let's take a moment to acknowledge that.\n\nPatient: You're right. It's not easy to break these habits, but I am making progress. I guess I just need to be patient with myself.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Self-compassion is key. Remember, you're learning new skills and ways of relating to yourself, and that's a process. It's okay to take it one step at a time.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. That's a good reminder. So, what's on the agenda for today's session?\n\nTherapist: That's a great question, Mei. Based on what you've shared so far, I think it could be helpful for us to focus on continuing to practice the skills we've been working on, particularly in relation to perfectionism and self-criticism. We can also review your progress with your coping card and relapse prevention plan, and discuss any adjustments or additions you might want to make. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'd also like to talk more about how I can continue to support myself after our sessions end. I know we've talked about it before, but I want to make sure I have a solid plan in place.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's a great idea. We can definitely spend some time discussing your support plan and any concerns you have about ending therapy. We can also review the progress you've made and celebrate your accomplishments. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds perfect. I'm looking forward to our discussion.",
