As we wrap up our session today, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in developing self-compassion and challenging perfectionistic thoughts. These are important skills that will serve you well as we continue our work together.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel like I'm starting to develop a more balanced perspective, even if it's still a work in progress.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Mei. Remember, it's not about being perfect - it's about showing up for yourself with kindness and understanding, one moment at a time.\n\nBefore we end our session, let's take a moment to check in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also hopeful. I know that I have some tools now to work with when I'm feeling self-critical or overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Mei. It's completely normal to feel tired after doing this kind of emotional work. I'm glad you're feeling hopeful and empowered with the tools you've learned.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the self-compassion exercises we discussed - the self-compassion break and the self-compassionate letter. Remember, it's not about doing them perfectly, but rather about showing up for yourself with kindness and understanding, even when it's challenging.\n\nPatient: I will definitely keep practicing. It's helpful to have a specific tool to turn to when I'm feeling self-critical.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful, Mei.
