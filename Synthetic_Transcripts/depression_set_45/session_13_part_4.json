  "transcript": "Patient: I can see how focusing on progress and self-compassion could help me break out of that perfectionistic mindset over time. It's just a matter of consistently practicing these skills and challenging those negative thoughts when they come up.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Mei. Consistent practice is key in developing new thought patterns and beliefs. It's normal to have setbacks and challenges along the way, but each time you notice those negative thoughts and actively work to challenge them, you're taking a step towards more balanced and adaptive thinking. As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling and if there's anything else you'd like to discuss before we assign homework.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful after our discussion today. It's helpful to have these specific techniques to work on, even if it's not always easy to put them into practice. I don't have anything else to add for today, but I appreciate you checking in.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful, Mei. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have ups and downs along the way. What matters is that you keep practicing these skills and reaching out for support when needed. For homework this week, I'd like you to continue working on your thought records, focusing on challenging perfectionistic thoughts related to your woodworking project and social interactions. Also, keep practicing the behavioral activation techniques we've discussed, setting small, achievable goals for yourself each day. Finally, continue with your Positive Data Log, recording evidence that supports more balanced and adaptive beliefs about yourself and your abilities. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds manageable. I'll do my best to stay consistent with the thought records and Positive Data Log, and I'll try to set some small goals for myself each day, even if it's just something like reaching out to a friend or spending a few minutes on a hobby.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Mei. Remember to celebrate those small victories and progress along the way, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support or guidance. We'll review your homework and discuss your experiences at our next session. Until then, take care of yourself and keep up the great work.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll do my best to stay consistent with the homework and techniques we've discussed. Have a great week!\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  1.
