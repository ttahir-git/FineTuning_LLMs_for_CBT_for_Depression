  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for our 16th session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as your AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in managing your depressive symptoms and improving your overall well-being. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or notable experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations as an AI therapist. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and positive activity scheduling. I did have a challenging moment last week when I couldn't complete a woodworking project to my usual standards. It triggered feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed. It's understandable that encountering a challenging situation with your woodworking project would trigger those difficult emotions, especially given your struggles with perfectionism. Let's explore that incident further. Can you walk me through what happened and the thoughts that came up for you in that moment?\n\nPatient: I was working on a intricate wooden box, and I made a mistake with the measurements. It wasn't fitting together as it should, and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. I started thinking, \"I'm useless. I can't even get this simple project right. What's the point of trying if I'm just going to fail?\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mei. Those thoughts sound very familiar, aligning with the core belief we've identified: \"I am incompetent and unworthy.\" Let's take a moment to examine those thoughts using the thought record technique. What evidence do you have that supports or refutes the idea that you're useless because of this mistake?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose I have completed many successful projects in the past. This is just one mistake, and it doesn't negate all my previous accomplishments. I guess I could also look at it as an opportunity to learn and improve my skills.\n\nTherapist: That's a great perspective, Mei. You're acknowledging the evidence that contradicts the negative thought and considering an alternative, more balanced view. This is an excellent example of using the thought record effectively. Remember, making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process, and it doesn't define your worth or competence.\n\nNow, let's set our agenda for today's session. We can continue exploring this incident and how it relates to your perfectionism and core beliefs. We can also review your experience with the homework assignments, particularly the positive activity scheduling. What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on the incident with the woodworking project and how it ties into my perfectionism. It's something that I really struggle with, and I feel like it's holding me back.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Mei. We can definitely dive deeper into how perfectionism affects you and explore strategies for challenging those perfectionistic thoughts and beliefs. Let's start by discussing how perfectionism shows up in your life and the impact it has on your emotions and behaviors.",
