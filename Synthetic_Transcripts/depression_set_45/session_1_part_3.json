  "transcript": "Patient: After retiring, I felt like I lost a big part of my identity. My career had been such a significant part of my life for so long, and without it, I felt adrift. I think the lack of structure and purpose contributed to my depressive symptoms.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that such a significant life change would have an impact on your mental health. Let's talk about how you've been coping with these feelings. You mentioned that you have a few close friends from your transgender support group and a neighbor you occasionally share meals with. How have these relationships helped you cope with your depressive symptoms?\n\nPatient: My friends from the support group have been a great source of understanding and validation. They've gone through similar experiences, so they can relate to what I'm going through. My neighbor has become a good friend, too. She's a widow, and we bonded over our shared love of travel. Spending time with her reminds me that I'm not alone, even though I often feel lonely.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful that you have these supportive relationships in your life. Having people who understand and relate to your experiences can make a big difference. Aside from these social connections, what other coping mechanisms have you been using to manage your depressive symptoms?\n\nPatient: I've always been a perfectionist, so I tend to throw myself into my DIY projects. The sense of accomplishment I get from completing a project helps me feel better, at least for a little while. I also try to find humor in everyday situations, which can help lift my mood temporarily. Journaling has been a helpful outlet for me to express my thoughts and emotions.\n\nTherapist: Perfectionism can be a double-edged sword. While it can drive you to achieve great things, it can also lead to self-criticism and feelings of inadequacy. We'll definitely explore this further in our future sessions. It's great that you've found healthy outlets like humor and journaling to help manage your symptoms. Have you ever sought professional help for your depression before?\n\nPatient: No, I haven't. I've always believed that I should be able to manage my emotions on my own. Seeking help felt like admitting weakness. But I'm starting to realize that I need support to work through these challenges.\n\nTherapist: It takes a lot of strength to recognize when we need help and to take the steps to get it. Many people struggle with the idea of seeking help, but it's a sign of self-awareness and courage, not weakness. Based on what you've shared so far, it seems like your depressive symptoms are closely tied to the loss of identity and purpose you experienced after retiring, as well as some deeply held beliefs about seeking help and managing emotions. Does this resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that makes sense. I've never really thought about it that way before, but it rings true. I feel like I've lost a part of myself, and I'm not sure how to find it again.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Mei. Rediscovering your sense of self and finding new sources of purpose and meaning will be an important part of our work together. As we continue with the assessment process, I'll be able to develop a more comprehensive understanding of your situation, which will help us create a tailored treatment plan to address your specific needs and goals. How are you feeling about the progress we've made so far in our session today?",
