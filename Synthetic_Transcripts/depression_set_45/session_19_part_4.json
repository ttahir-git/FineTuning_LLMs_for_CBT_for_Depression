It's been a privilege to support you on this journey, and I have full faith in your ability to continue moving forward with the tools and insights you've gained.\n\nDo you have any final thoughts or questions before we wrap up today?\n\nPatient: I just want to say thank you for all your support and guidance. It's been a challenging journey, but I feel like I've made a lot of progress, and I'm grateful for your help along the way.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Mei. It's been an honor to work with you and witness your growth. Remember, the progress you've made is yours to keep, and the skills you've developed will continue to serve you as you move forward.
