  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's dive into the challenges you've faced with behavioral activation and setting small goals. Can you share a specific example of a goal you set for yourself and what made it difficult to achieve?\n\nPatient: Last week, I set a goal to work on my woodworking project for at least 30 minutes a day. But when the time came to start working on it, I just couldn't find the motivation to get started. I kept thinking about how I might make mistakes or not enjoy the process.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mei. It's common to encounter obstacles when trying to engage in activities, especially when depression is involved. Let's break down the thoughts and feelings that arose when you considered working on your project. What emotions did you experience, and how intense were they?\n\nPatient: I felt anxious and overwhelmed at the thought of starting the project. The intensity was probably around 70 for both emotions.\n\nTherapist: I can understand how those emotions might make it challenging to find motivation. Now, let's identify the thoughts that contributed to those feelings. What was going through your mind when you thought about working on your project?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I'm going to make mistakes and feel frustrated,\" and \"I won't enjoy the process anyway, so why bother?\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts seem to be fueling the anxiety and overwhelm you experienced. Let's look at them more closely. The first thought, \"I'm going to make mistakes and feel frustrated,\" contains a cognitive distortion called fortune-telling. You're predicting a negative outcome without evidence. The second thought, \"I won't enjoy the process anyway, so why bother?\" is an example of a distortion called emotional reasoning, where you assume your negative feelings reflect reality.\n\nTo challenge these thoughts, let's consider some alternative perspectives. First, is it guaranteed that you'll make mistakes and feel frustrated?\n\nPatient: Well, no, I suppose it's not guaranteed. There have been times when I've worked on projects and enjoyed the process without making mistakes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Mei. Just because you've experienced frustration before doesn't mean it will always happen. Now, let's look at the second thought. Is it possible that you might enjoy the process of working on your project, even if it's challenging at times?\n\nPatient: I guess it is possible. There are moments when I get into a flow state and find the work satisfying, even if it's not always easy.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Challenging the idea that you won't enjoy the process can help you find the motivation to get started. Remember, you don't have to feel completely confident or motivated to begin. Starting with small, manageable steps can help you build momentum and increase your chances of success.\n\nLet's set a new goal related to your woodworking project, keeping in mind the insights we've discussed. What small, achievable step could you take this week to move forward with your project?\n\nPatient: I could commit to gathering my materials and setting up my workspace, even if I don't start working on the project itself. That way, I'll feel more prepared when I'm ready to begin.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Mei! Setting up your workspace is a concrete, achievable goal that can help you build momentum. Remember to challenge any negative thoughts that arise and focus on the possibility of enjoying the process.\n\nAs you work on this goal, pay attention to your thoughts and emotions. If you notice any self-critical thoughts or predictions of failure, try to reframe them using the techniques we've practiced. And don't hesitate to reach out for support if you need it.",
