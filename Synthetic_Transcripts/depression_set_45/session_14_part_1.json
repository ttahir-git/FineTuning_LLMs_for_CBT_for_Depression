  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the thought records and behavioral activation. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and overall outlook.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. Every step counts, and it's great that you're persisting despite the challenges. Can you tell me more about your experience with the thought records and behavioral activation exercises?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to catch my negative thoughts and challenge them using the thought record technique. It's not always easy to remember to do it in the moment, but when I do, I find that it helps me see things from a different perspective. As for the behavioral activation, I've been setting small goals for myself, like going for a short walk or calling a friend. It's hard to motivate myself sometimes, but I usually feel a bit better afterwards.\n\nTherapist: That's really encouraging to hear, Mei. Recognizing and challenging negative thoughts is a skill that takes practice, so it's normal to struggle with it at first. The fact that you're noticing a shift in perspective when you use the thought records is a sign that you're on the right track. And setting small, achievable goals for behavioral activation is a great way to build momentum and improve your mood. Let's take a moment to acknowledge the progress you've made so far.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It helps to hear that I'm making progress, even if it doesn't always feel like it.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mei. Now, let's discuss our plan for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to review your thought records and explore any challenges you've faced with that technique. We can also discuss your experience with behavioral activation and see if there are any adjustments we can make to help you stay motivated. Additionally, I'd like to introduce a new technique called the Positive Data Log, which can help you gather evidence to support more balanced and adaptive beliefs about yourself. What do you think about this plan?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm particularly interested in learning about the Positive Data Log, as I often struggle with negative beliefs about myself.\n\nTherapist: Great, we'll definitely focus on the Positive Data Log then. Before we move on, is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today's session?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main points I wanted to discuss.",
