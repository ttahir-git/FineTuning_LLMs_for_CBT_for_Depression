  "transcript": "Therapist: I'm glad you brought up perfectionism, Mei. It's a common challenge that can contribute to feelings of worthlessness and depression. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a situation where perfectionism has held you back or caused distress?\n\nPatient: Well, I've always been a perfectionist when it comes to my woodworking projects. I often spend hours trying to get every detail just right, and if I make even a small mistake, I feel like the whole project is ruined. Sometimes, I'll even abandon a project altogether because I don't think it meets my standards.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Mei. I can understand how that level of perfectionism could be distressing and lead to feelings of failure or inadequacy. Let's look at this from a cognitive perspective. What thoughts go through your mind when you make a mistake or feel like a project isn't meeting your standards?\n\nPatient: I usually think things like, \"I'm not good enough,\" or \"I'll never be able to create something truly beautiful.\" I often feel like my work is a reflection of my self-worth, so if my project isn't perfect, then I must be flawed in some way.\n\nTherapist: Those are some powerful thoughts, Mei. I want to introduce a concept called \"all-or-nothing thinking\" or \"black-and-white thinking.\" This is a common cognitive distortion where we see things in extreme, absolute terms without acknowledging the middle ground. It sounds like you might be engaging in this type of thinking when it comes to your woodworking projects. Would you agree?\n\nPatient: Yes, I can see how that applies to my situation. I often think in very black-and-white terms when it comes to my work.\n\nTherapist: Recognizing that pattern is an important first step, Mei. Now, let's challenge that all-or-nothing thinking. When you make a mistake or feel like a project isn't perfect, is it truly a complete failure? Are there any aspects of the project that you can appreciate or learn from?\n\nPatient: When you put it that way, I can see that there are usually some parts of the project that I'm proud of, even if it's not perfect. And I can always learn from my mistakes and improve my skills for the next project.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Mei! By acknowledging the shades of gray between perfection and failure, you can start to develop a more balanced and compassionate perspective. Remember, perfectionism is often driven by a fear of failure or inadequacy, but making mistakes is a natural and necessary part of growth and learning.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I need to work on embracing my imperfections and seeing them as opportunities for growth instead of failures.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Mei. You're already making great progress in recognizing and challenging those perfectionistic thoughts. As we continue our work together, we can explore more strategies for developing self-compassion and letting go of the need for perfection. How do you feel about incorporating some self-compassion exercises into your homework for next week?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good idea. I'm open to trying anything that might help me be kinder to myself and less focused on perfection.\n\nTherapist: Great! We'll come back to that at the end of our session and discuss some specific exercises you can try. For now, I want to check in on your experience with the homework from our last session. How did you find the thought records and mindfulness exercises?",
