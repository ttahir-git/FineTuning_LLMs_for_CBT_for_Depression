  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's take a closer look at one of the self-critical thoughts you've been struggling with. Can you share an example?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I was working on a woodworking project, and I made a mistake that ruined the piece I was working on. I immediately thought to myself, \"I'm so useless. I can't even get this simple project right.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mei. I can understand how that thought would lead to feelings of worthlessness. Let's apply the thought record technique to this situation. What emotions did you experience when you had that thought, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt frustrated, disappointed in myself, and sad. The intensity was probably around 80.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have the situation, the emotion, and the intensity. Now, let's identify the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm so useless. I can't even get this simple project right.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I did ruin the piece I was working on, and it was a project I've done before, so it should have been simple for me.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against this thought?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could consider all the successful projects I've completed in the past. And the fact that everyone makes mistakes sometimes, even with tasks they're familiar with.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. Now, let's look at the evidence on both sides and come up with an alternative, more balanced thought. Based on the evidence, what might be a more accurate way to view this situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"I made a mistake on this project, but that doesn't mean I'm useless. I've had many successes in the past, and one mistake doesn't define my overall skill or worth.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Mei. It acknowledges the mistake but doesn't overgeneralize it to your entire sense of self. Now, let's re-rate the intensity of the emotions you felt after considering this alternative thought.\n\nPatient: I'd say the intensity has gone down to about 50.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant decrease in intensity, Mei. This shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing our emotions. By challenging the negative thought and coming up with a more balanced perspective, you were able to reduce the intensity of the emotions you experienced.\n\nNow, let's discuss how we can apply this technique to your self-compassion exercises. When you notice yourself having self-critical thoughts, try to pause and apply the thought record technique. Challenge the negative thoughts and come up with a more self-compassionate alternative. With practice, this can help you develop a more balanced and kind inner dialogue.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to incorporate the thought record technique into my self-compassion exercises moving forward.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, it takes practice to change long-standing thought patterns, so be patient with yourself as you work on this. If you find yourself struggling to come up with alternative thoughts, imagine what you might say to a friend in a similar situation. We're often much kinder and more understanding with others than we are with ourselves.\n\nAnother strategy that can be helpful is to set aside dedicated time each day for your self-compassion exercises. This can help you prioritize them and make them a consistent part of your routine. What do you think about scheduling 10-15 minutes each day to focus on self-compassion?\n\nPatient: I think that's a good idea. I can set aside time in the evening, after dinner, to work on my self-compassion exercises. That way, it becomes a regular part of my daily routine.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Mei. Remember, consistency is key when it comes to developing new habits and thought patterns. By dedicating time each day to practice self-compassion, you're taking an active step towards improving your mental well-being.\n\nNow, let's explore how your self-critical thoughts and feelings of worthlessness might be connected to your depressive symptoms. Can you share how these thoughts and feelings impact your daily life and overall mood?",
