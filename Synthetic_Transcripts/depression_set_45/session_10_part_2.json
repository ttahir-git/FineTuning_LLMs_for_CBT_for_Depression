  "transcript": "Patient: Last session, we discussed using the thought record technique to challenge my negative thoughts. I've been trying to use it when I catch myself being self-critical, but it's been challenging to do it consistently.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you've been working on using the thought record technique. It's normal to face challenges when implementing a new skill. Can you tell me more about what's been difficult for you in using this technique consistently?\n\nPatient: Well, sometimes I get so caught up in the negative thoughts that I don't even realize I'm being self-critical until I'm already feeling down. And other times, I just don't feel motivated to go through the process of writing everything out.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Mei. It's common for negative thoughts to feel so automatic that we don't always catch them right away. And it's understandable that when you're feeling down, it can be hard to find the motivation to use a new skill. Let's explore this a bit more. Can you think of a specific situation this week where you noticed yourself being self-critical, and you had trouble using the thought record technique?\n\nPatient: Yeah, it happened a few days ago. I was working on a woodworking project, and I made a mistake. I started thinking things like, \"I'm so incompetent. I can't even get this simple project right.\" Before I knew it, I was feeling really discouraged and down on myself.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Mei. Let's break this down using the thought record technique. What emotions were you feeling in that moment, and how intense were they?\n\nPatient: I was feeling frustrated, disappointed in myself, and a bit hopeless. The intensity was probably around an 8 out of 10.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you were experiencing some pretty intense emotions. And the thoughts you identified were, \"I'm so incompetent. I can't even get this simple project right.\" Is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\n\nTherapist: Now, let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're incompetent and can't get the project right?\n\nPatient: Well, I did make a mistake on the project, and it felt like something I should have been able to do easily.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against these thoughts? Have there been times when you've successfully completed woodworking projects or handled challenges competently?\n\nPatient: When I think about it, I have completed a lot of projects successfully in the past. And even though I made a mistake this time, I was able to figure out how to fix it. So I guess that shows some competence.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! It sounds like you have plenty of evidence that you are capable and competent, even if you make mistakes sometimes. Everyone makes mistakes, and it doesn't mean you're incompetent. With this evidence in mind, how could you reframe your original thoughts in a more balanced way?\n\nPatient: I could say something like, \"I made a mistake, but that doesn't mean I'm incompetent. I've successfully completed many projects before, and I can learn from this mistake and keep improving.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Mei. It acknowledges the mistake but doesn't jump to the conclusion that you're incompetent. It also reminds you of your past successes and frames the mistake as an opportunity for growth. If you had this thought instead of the original self-critical thoughts, how do you think it would impact your emotions and behavior?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel less discouraged and more motivated to keep working on the project. I might be more likely to problem-solve and try to fix the mistake instead of giving up.\n\nTherapist: That makes a lot of sense. This is a great example of how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all connected. By challenging the negative thoughts and coming up with a more balanced perspective, it can lead to more helpful emotions and behaviors. With practice, it will get easier to catch those negative thoughts and reframe them in the moment.",
