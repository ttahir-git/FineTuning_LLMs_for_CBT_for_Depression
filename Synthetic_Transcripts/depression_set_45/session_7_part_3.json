  "transcript": "Therapist: Cognitive restructuring involves identifying negative thought patterns, such as all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, or disqualifying the positive. These patterns, also known as cognitive distortions, can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety. By recognizing these distortions and challenging them, we can develop more balanced and helpful ways of thinking.\n\nFor example, let's say you have the thought, \"I'm a failure because I made a mistake on my woodworking project.\" This thought might be an example of all-or-nothing thinking, where you see things in extreme, black-and-white terms. To challenge this thought, you could consider the evidence that contradicts it, such as the many successful projects you've completed in the past or the fact that everyone makes mistakes sometimes. Then, you could reframe the thought in a more balanced way, such as, \"I made a mistake, but that doesn't mean I'm a failure. I can learn from this and keep improving.\"\n\nDoes this example make sense to you, Mei? Can you think of any negative thought patterns that you've noticed in yourself?\n\nPatient: Yes, that example makes sense. I can see how I often fall into all-or-nothing thinking, especially when it comes to my projects or my relationships. I tend to think that if I'm not perfect, then I'm a failure, or if someone doesn't respond to me in a certain way, they must be upset with me.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Mei. Recognizing these negative thought patterns is an important first step in cognitive restructuring. Another common distortion is overgeneralization, where we take one negative experience and assume that it will always happen. For example, if you have one difficult interaction with a friend, you might think, \"I always mess up my relationships.\"\n\nTo challenge this distortion, you could look for evidence that contradicts the overgeneralization, such as times when you've had positive interactions with friends or when you've successfully maintained relationships. Then, you could reframe the thought in a more balanced way, such as, \"One difficult interaction doesn't mean I always mess up my relationships. I have many positive connections in my life.\"\n\nWhat do you think about this example, Mei? Can you see how challenging overgeneralization might be helpful for you?\n\nPatient: I can definitely relate to that example. I often find myself overgeneralizing, especially when it comes to my relationships. I have a tendency to assume that one negative interaction means that the entire relationship is doomed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Mei. Challenging overgeneralization can help you maintain a more balanced perspective on your relationships and reduce feelings of anxiety or hopelessness. Another distortion to be aware of is disqualifying the positive, where you dismiss or minimize positive experiences or qualities about yourself.\n\nFor example, if you receive a compliment on your woodworking project, you might think, \"They're just being nice. My work isn't that great.\" To challenge this distortion, you could consider the evidence that supports the positive feedback, such as the time and effort you put into the project or the skills you've developed over time. Then, you could practice accepting the compliment and acknowledging your achievements, such as, \"I worked hard on this project, and it's okay to feel proud of what I've accomplished.\"\n\nWhat do you think about this example, Mei? Can you see how disqualifying the positive might show up in your own thinking?\n\nPatient: I can definitely see how I tend to dismiss positive feedback or achievements. I often think that people are just being polite, or that I don't really deserve the praise. It's hard for me to accept compliments or acknowledge my own strengths.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Mei. Learning to accept and appreciate the positive aspects of yourself and your experiences can help counteract feelings of worthlessness or inadequacy. As we continue with cognitive restructuring, we'll work on identifying and challenging these negative thought patterns and developing more balanced and helpful ways of thinking.\n\nRemember, this process takes time and practice, and it's okay to start small. You can begin by noticing when you engage in all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, or disqualifying the positive, and gently remind yourself to consider the evidence and reframe the thought in a more balanced way.",
