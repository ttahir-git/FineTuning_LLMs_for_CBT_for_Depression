  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the thought record and Positive Data Log. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and overall outlook.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, Mei. Can you share more about the challenges you've faced while using the thought record and Positive Data Log?\n\nPatient: Well, I find it difficult to consistently challenge my negative thoughts, especially when I'm feeling particularly low. Sometimes, the evidence against my negative beliefs doesn't feel strong enough to counteract the emotions I'm experiencing.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Mei. It takes time and practice to build the skill of challenging negative thoughts, and it's not always easy when you're feeling low. Remember that even small pieces of evidence against your negative beliefs can be valuable in supporting more balanced and adaptive thoughts. Let's explore this further today. What else would you like to focus on in our session?\n\nPatient: I'd like to discuss my experiences with the behavioral experiment we set last time and how it relates to my negative beliefs about social situations. I also want to talk more about my struggles with motivation and setting small goals for behavioral activation.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on, Mei. Let's add them to our agenda for today. We can start by reviewing your experience with the behavioral experiment and then move on to discussing your challenges with motivation and goal-setting for behavioral activation. We'll also explore how these experiences relate to your negative beliefs and work on developing more balanced and adaptive thoughts. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I'm ready to get started.",
