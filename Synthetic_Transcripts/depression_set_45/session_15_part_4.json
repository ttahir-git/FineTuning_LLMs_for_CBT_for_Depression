You've been actively practicing the techniques we've discussed, like thought records, behavioral activation, and now, positive activity scheduling. These skills take time and effort to develop, and I commend you for your dedication to your well-being.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It hasn't been easy, but I'm starting to see how these techniques can help me manage my depressive symptoms and improve my overall mood.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Mei. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there may be ups and downs along the way. What's important is that you continue to practice these skills and be patient with yourself. Before we end our session, let's discuss your homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue practicing thought records, focusing on challenging negative thoughts related to perfectionism. Additionally, try to schedule at least one positive activity into your week, something that brings you a sense of pleasure, mastery, or connection. Finally, keep using the Positive Data Log to gather evidence that supports more balanced and adaptive beliefs about yourself and your abilities.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll make a list of positive activities I can schedule into my week and keep practicing the thought records and Positive Data Log.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, if you encounter any challenges or have questions, feel free to bring them up in our next session. How are you feeling as we wrap up today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling encouraged and motivated to keep practicing these techniques. I know it won't be easy, but I'm hopeful that I can continue to make progress.\n\nTherapist: That's a great mindset to have, Mei. Remember, you have the skills and tools to manage your depressive symptoms and improve your well-being. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Until our next session, take care of yourself and keep up the great work!\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.
