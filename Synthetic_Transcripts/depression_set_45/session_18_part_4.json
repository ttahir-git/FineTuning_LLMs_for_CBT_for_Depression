  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up our session today, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in challenging your core belief of being incompetent and unworthy. Moving from an 8 or 9 to a 5 or 6 on the belief scale is a significant shift, and it's a testament to your hard work and dedication to the therapeutic process.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a challenging journey, but I feel like I'm starting to see things differently.\n\nTherapist: Before we end our session, let's do a quick check-in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but overall, I'm in a better place than when we started the session. I'm grateful for the tools you've given me and the progress we've made together.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling better than when we started, and I'm glad our work together has been helpful for you. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have ups and downs. The important thing is that you now have the skills to navigate those challenges more effectively.\n\nFor your homework this week, I'd like you to continue using the Positive Data Log to gather evidence that supports your new, more balanced beliefs about yourself. I also encourage you to practice cognitive restructuring whenever you notice negative thoughts, especially those related to your core belief of being incompetent and unworthy.\n\nPatient: I will definitely keep working on those techniques. It's helpful to have specific tasks to focus on between our sessions.\n\nTherapist: Great! I look forward to hearing about your experiences with the homework in our next session. In the meantime, remember to be kind and compassionate with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for support if you need it.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  1. Reviewed Mei's experience with the Positive Data Log and cognitive restructuring homework assignments\n  2.
