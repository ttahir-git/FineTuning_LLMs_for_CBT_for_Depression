  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for session 9. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive into today's agenda, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been practicing the thought record technique and the self-compassion exercises you introduced. I've noticed some improvements in my mood, but I still struggle with self-critical thoughts and feelings of worthlessness at times. I'm hoping we can continue working on these issues today.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we discussed and have noticed some improvements in your mood. It's completely normal to still experience struggles with self-critical thoughts and feelings of worthlessness. These patterns often take time to change, and that's why we're here to work on them together. Let's start by setting an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I'd like to focus on my self-critical thoughts and how they contribute to my feelings of worthlessness. I also want to discuss how I can be more consistent with the self-compassion exercises, as I find them helpful but sometimes struggle to make time for them.\n\nTherapist: Those are great priorities for today's session. I'd also like to spend some time reviewing your experience with the thought record technique and explore any challenges or successes you've had with it. We can then discuss strategies for managing self-critical thoughts and incorporating self-compassion exercises into your daily routine. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's begin by reviewing your experience with the thought record technique. Can you share some examples of how you've used it since our last session and any challenges or successes you've encountered?",
