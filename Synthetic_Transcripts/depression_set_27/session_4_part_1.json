  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jian, it's great to see you again for our fourth session. Before we begin, I want to remind you that while I'm here to support you, I do have some limitations as an AI therapist. I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to working with you and supporting your journey towards better mental health. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your support. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the thought recording and generating alternative thoughts. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I also tried out a new coping strategy - going for a walk in the park when I feel overwhelmed. It helped a bit, but I still struggle with feelings of isolation and low self-esteem.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we discussed and that you found a new coping strategy. It's okay if progress feels slow or challenging at times - that's a normal part of the process. I appreciate you sharing your ongoing struggles with isolation and low self-esteem. Let's make sure to address those in today's session. How about we start by setting an agenda? What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on strategies for building social connections and improving my self-esteem. Those are the areas where I feel the most stuck right now.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. We can definitely explore strategies for building social connections and improving self-esteem. I'd also like to review your experience with the homework and continue practicing thought recording and generating alternative thoughts. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's begin by reviewing your experience with the homework. Can you share some examples of the thought records you completed and how the process of generating alternative thoughts went for you?",
