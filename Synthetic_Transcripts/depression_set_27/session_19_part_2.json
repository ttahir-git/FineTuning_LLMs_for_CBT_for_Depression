  "transcript": "Patient: One core belief I'd like to work on is the idea that I'm not capable of succeeding in my field. It's something that comes up a lot for me, especially with the job search stress.\n\nTherapist: That's a great choice, Jian. Beliefs about our capabilities and potential for success can have a big impact on our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Let's start by examining the evidence for and against this belief. Can you think of any experiences or accomplishments that challenge the idea that you're not capable of succeeding in your field?\n\nPatient: Well, like I mentioned before, completing my doctoral degree is probably the biggest thing. It wasn't easy, especially with the cultural adjustment and being far from my family, but I stuck with it and finished.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, completing a doctoral degree is a significant accomplishment that demonstrates your capability and perseverance. What about during your studies \u2013 were there any projects or moments where you felt a sense of mastery or success in your field?\n\nPatient: There were a few research projects I worked on that went pretty well. I got some good feedback from my advisors, and one of the projects even got published in a journal. I guess that counts as success in my field, even if it's not the same as getting a job.\n\nTherapist: Definitely! Having your work published in a journal is a clear indicator of your capability and the value of your contributions to your field. It's a great piece of evidence against the belief that you're not capable of succeeding. Let's think about the job search process itself \u2013 I know it's been challenging, but have there been any small successes or signs of progress along the way?\n\nPatient: I suppose so. I've had a few interviews, and even though they didn't lead to a job offer, just getting the interviews feels like a small win. And I've been trying to network more, reaching out to people in my field. That's been scary, but it's also led to some good conversations and potential leads.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples, Jian. Interviews and networking are key parts of the job search process, and the fact that you're putting yourself out there and making those connections is a sign of your capability and proactive approach. It's okay that it hasn't led to a job offer yet \u2013 that's something external that you can't fully control. What matters is that you're taking steps and making progress, which challenges the belief that you're not capable of succeeding.\n\nPatient: I guess you're right. It's hard to see those things as successes when I don't have a job yet, but I can see how they count as evidence against that core belief.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that it feels hard to see those things as successes, especially when you're dealing with the stress and uncertainty of the job search. That's where practicing a more balanced and compassionate perspective can be helpful. Let's try reframing those experiences as signs of your capability and resilience, rather than as failures. For example, instead of thinking \"I didn't get the job, so I'm not capable,\" try something like \"I put myself out there and gave it my best shot, which shows my determination and willingness to take risks.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's like looking at the situation from a different angle, focusing on what I can control and what I've done well, instead of just the outcome.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jian. Reframing the situation and focusing on your efforts and progress, rather than just the outcome, can help you develop a more balanced and adaptive perspective. It's a key part of modifying that core belief about your capability. As we continue with this process, it's also important to practice self-compassion and recognize that everyone faces challenges and setbacks \u2013 it doesn't mean you're not capable or that you won't succeed in the long run.",
