  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jian, it's great to see you again for session 15. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned, but it's been challenging. I've added a few new pieces of evidence and alternative thoughts to my coping card, but I haven't been as consistent as I'd like to be. I'm still struggling with feelings of inadequacy and the pressure to succeed in my career.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Jian. It's common to face challenges when working on new skills and trying to change long-standing thought patterns. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about the specific difficulties you've encountered while working on your homework?\n\nPatient: Well, I find it hard to come up with alternative thoughts that feel genuine. Even when I write them down, I struggle to believe them fully. It's like there's a part of me that's resistant to change, even though I know these negative thoughts are holding me back.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jian. It's not uncommon to feel a sense of resistance or inner conflict when trying to change deeply ingrained beliefs. Our thoughts and beliefs can be quite stubborn, especially when they've been reinforced over time. The fact that you're recognizing this resistance is an important step in the process of change.\n\nPatient: I guess you're right. It's just frustrating sometimes, feeling like I'm taking two steps forward and one step back.\n\nTherapist: I understand that frustration, Jian. Change is rarely a linear process, and setbacks are a normal part of the journey. What matters is that you keep moving forward, even if it feels slow or difficult at times. Let's take a look at your coping card and the evidence and alternative thoughts you've added. Can you share some examples with me?\n\nPatient: Sure. One situation that triggered my negative thoughts was when I received a rejection letter from a job I applied to. My automatic thought was, \"I'm never going to find a job in my field. I'm a failure.\" The evidence I wrote down against this thought was that I've successfully completed my doctoral degree, which is a significant achievement, and that one rejection doesn't define my entire career. An alternative thought I came up with was, \"Rejection is a normal part of the job search process, and it doesn't reflect my worth or capabilities.\"\n\nTherapist: That's excellent work, Jian. You've identified a specific situation, the automatic thought it triggered, and you've come up with evidence against the thought and an alternative perspective. This is precisely the kind of work we're aiming for in CBT. How did you feel after going through this process?\n\nPatient: I felt a bit better, but the negative thought still lingers in the back of my mind. It's hard to shake off completely.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, Jian. These thoughts and beliefs have likely been with you for a long time, so it's natural for them to persist even as you work on challenging them. The key is to continue practicing this process of examining the evidence and generating alternative thoughts. Over time, with consistent practice, it will become easier to challenge these negative thoughts, and they will have less power over you.\n\nPatient: I hope so. I just wish I could speed up the process.\n\nTherapist: I hear your desire for quicker progress, Jian. However, it's essential to remember that lasting change takes time and patience. You're making important strides in the right direction, and that's what matters most. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on? We could continue working on challenging negative thoughts, explore strategies for managing job search stress, or discuss ways to build social connections. What feels most important to you right now?",
