  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jian, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few important things about our work together. As an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. Sometimes, I might generate inaccurate information or misunderstand something you say. I also want to remind you that I can't provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or trusted support person. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I can't observe your non-verbal cues, so I'll be checking in with you regularly to make sure I understand how you're feeling. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. It's good to be reminded of those things. I'm ready to get started with today's session.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have you noticed any changes in your mood or experiences?\n\nPatient: I've been doing okay. I've been trying to use the Downward Arrow Technique when I notice negative thoughts about my job search. It's helping me see the underlying beliefs, but it's still hard to challenge them sometimes. I feel a bit stuck.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been practicing the Downward Arrow Technique. It's normal to feel stuck at times when challenging long-held beliefs. We can definitely explore that more today. How about your mood and other depression symptoms? Have you noticed any changes there?\n\nPatient: My mood has been pretty stable, I think. I've had a few moments of feeling really down, but I try to use the coping skills we've talked about, like deep breathing and looking at my coping card. It helps a bit in the moment.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the coping skills are providing some relief. It's good that you're able to recognize when you need to use them. Let's make a note to review your coping card later and see if there's anything we can add or change.\n\nPatient: Sounds good.\n\nTherapist: Before we move on, is there anything else you want to share about how you've been doing since our last session?\n\nPatient: Not really. Just more of the same, I guess. The job search is still stressful, and I'm worried about what will happen if I don't find something soon.\n\nTherapist: I understand that the job search stress is still weighing heavily on you. Let's make sure to include that in our agenda for today. Speaking of which, let's go ahead and set our agenda now. What would you like to prioritize in our session today?\n\nPatient: Definitely the job search stress and working on challenging those underlying beliefs. And maybe we could review my coping card like you mentioned.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, those are great priorities. I'd also like to spend some time reviewing your progress with the Downward Arrow Technique and exploring any challenges you've encountered. We can also discuss some additional strategies for managing the job search stress. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm ready to get started.",
