  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jian, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the thought records and challenging my negative thoughts related to job search stress and social interactions. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood. I attended a photography meetup last weekend, which was a bit nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I went.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on the thought records and challenging your negative thoughts. Attending the photography meetup is a significant step forward in building social connections. I'm curious to know more about your experience at the meetup. What thoughts and emotions came up for you before, during, and after the event?\n\nPatient: Before the meetup, I was really nervous and kept thinking that I wouldn't fit in or that people would judge me for being quiet. During the meetup, I felt a bit awkward at first, but as I started talking to a few people, I realized that they were friendly and welcoming. After the meetup, I felt a sense of accomplishment for pushing myself out of my comfort zone, but I also noticed some self-critical thoughts creeping in, like \"I should have been more outgoing\" or \"I didn't make a good impression.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing your experience so openly. It's common to have those anxious thoughts before and during social situations, especially when trying something new. I'm glad to hear that you pushed through the initial awkwardness and found the group to be friendly and welcoming. It's also important to recognize and address the self-critical thoughts that came up afterward. Let's explore those thoughts further. What evidence do you have that supports or refutes the idea that you didn't make a good impression?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the fact that people were friendly and engaging with me could be evidence that I didn't make a terrible impression. But I still feel like I could have been more outgoing or contributed more to the conversations.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're able to identify evidence that challenges your self-critical thoughts. Recognizing that people were friendly and engaging with you is a good indication that you made a positive impression. It's also important to remember that it's okay to be yourself in social situations and that you don't have to be overly outgoing to be liked or accepted. Let's work on generating an alternative thought based on the evidence. What's a more balanced way to view your experience at the meetup?\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought could be, \"Even though I was quiet at times, people still engaged with me, and I took a step forward by attending the meetup. I don't need to be perfect in social situations to make a positive impression.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought! It acknowledges your progress and the positive aspects of the experience while also challenging the self-critical thoughts. Remembering this alternative thought can help you feel more confident and motivated to continue building social connections. Let's set an agenda for today's session. We can continue working on thought records and cognitive restructuring related to job search stress and social interactions, explore your experience with setting small social goals, and discuss any other concerns or goals that have come up for you. What would you like to prioritize in our session today?",
