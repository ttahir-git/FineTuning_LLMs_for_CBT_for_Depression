  "transcript": "Therapist: Attending the photography meetup seems to have had a positive impact on your thoughts and feelings about social interactions. Let's explore that a bit further. What thoughts did you have before and after the meetup?\n\nPatient: Before the meetup, I was nervous and kept thinking that I wouldn't fit in or have anything interesting to say. I almost convinced myself not to go. But after the meetup, I realized that I could connect with others over a shared interest, and people were more welcoming than I expected.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Jian. It's common to have negative predictions about social situations, but as you experienced, those predictions aren't always accurate. By facing your fears and attending the meetup, you were able to gather evidence that challenged your initial thoughts. This is similar to the cognitive restructuring process we've been working on.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess it is. It's just hard to remember that in the moment when I'm feeling anxious.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's why it's so important to continue practicing and gathering evidence to support more balanced thoughts. Let's think about how you can apply this experience to future social situations. What's another small goal you could set for yourself to continue building connections?\n\nPatient: Well, there's another photography meetup next month that I could attend. I could also try to initiate a conversation with someone new at my veterans support group.\n\nTherapist: Those are both great ideas, Jian. Setting small, achievable goals like these can help you continue to challenge your negative thoughts and build confidence in social situations. Remember to use your thought records to track your thoughts and emotions before and after these experiences, so we can discuss them in future sessions.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll definitely do that. It's helpful to have a plan and a way to process my thoughts and feelings.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find it helpful. As you continue to practice these skills, you'll likely find it easier to challenge negative thoughts and engage in social situations. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there may be setbacks along the way, but each experience is an opportunity to learn and grow.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I know I need to be patient with myself and celebrate the small victories.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jian. You're making great progress, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's continue to work on challenging negative thoughts and setting small goals for social connections. In our next session, we can review your thought records and discuss your experiences with these new goals.",
