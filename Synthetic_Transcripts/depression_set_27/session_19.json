Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the Downward Arrow Technique and cognitive restructuring when I notice myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns. It's not always easy, but I think it's helping a bit. I've also been using the coping card we created, and it's been a good reminder of my strengths and accomplishments.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed and finding some benefit from the coping card. Remember, it's normal for it to feel challenging at times, but the more you practice, the more natural it will become. Can you share an example of a time when you used the Downward Arrow Technique or cognitive restructuring since our last session?\n\nPatient: Sure. Earlier this week, I started feeling really down about my job search. I caught myself thinking, \"I'll never find a job in my field.\" So, I tried using the Downward Arrow Technique. I asked myself what that thought meant about me, and I realized it was tied to my belief that I'm a failure. Then, I tried to challenge that belief by looking at the evidence, like the fact that I completed my doctoral degree, which is a big accomplishment. It didn't make the job search stress go away completely, but it helped me feel a bit more balanced.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example of putting the skills we've discussed into practice. You did a great job of identifying the negative thought, using the Downward Arrow Technique to uncover the underlying belief, and then challenging that belief with evidence. It's okay that it didn't make the stress disappear completely \u2013 the goal is to find more balance and perspective, which it sounds like you did. How did you feel after going through that process?\n\nPatient: I felt a bit lighter, I guess. It was like I could see things from a different angle, instead of just getting stuck in that negative spiral. It gave me a bit of hope that even if the job search is tough, it doesn't mean I'm a failure.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Jian. Shifting your perspective and finding hope, even in challenging situations, is a big part of building resilience. You're doing a great job of applying these skills in your daily life. Now, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on? We could review your experience with the coping card and Downward Arrow Technique in more depth, continue practicing cognitive restructuring, explore your progress and challenges in modifying underlying beliefs, or discuss any other concerns or goals that have come up for you.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on modifying underlying beliefs. I'm starting to see how some of my core beliefs, like the idea that I'm a failure, are impacting my thoughts and feelings in a lot of areas of my life. I want to work on shifting those beliefs, but it feels daunting. Can we talk about strategies for doing that?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's a great topic to focus on today. Modifying underlying beliefs can feel daunting at first, but there are several strategies we can use to approach it. One powerful technique is to examine the evidence for and against the belief, similar to what you did with the job search example you shared earlier. Another strategy is to conduct behavioral experiments to test out the validity of the belief. We can also work on developing new, more adaptive beliefs to replace the old ones. Let's start by identifying one core belief you'd like to work on modifying. What comes to mind?\n\nPatient: One core belief I'd like to work on is the idea that I'm not capable of succeeding in my field. It's something that comes up a lot for me, especially with the job search stress.\n\nTherapist: That's a great choice, Jian. Beliefs about our capabilities and potential for success can have a big impact on our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Let's start by examining the evidence for and against this belief. Can you think of any experiences or accomplishments that challenge the idea that you're not capable of succeeding in your field?\n\nPatient: Well, like I mentioned before, completing my doctoral degree is probably the biggest thing. It wasn't easy, especially with the cultural adjustment and being far from my family, but I stuck with it and finished.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, completing a doctoral degree is a significant accomplishment that demonstrates your capability and perseverance. What about during your studies \u2013 were there any projects or moments where you felt a sense of mastery or success in your field?\n\nPatient: There were a few research projects I worked on that went pretty well. I got some good feedback from my advisors, and one of the projects even got published in a journal. I guess that counts as success in my field, even if it's not the same as getting a job.\n\nTherapist: Definitely! Having your work published in a journal is a clear indicator of your capability and the value of your contributions to your field. It's a great piece of evidence against the belief that you're not capable of succeeding. Let's think about the job search process itself \u2013 I know it's been challenging, but have there been any small successes or signs of progress along the way?\n\nPatient: I suppose so. I've had a few interviews, and even though they didn't lead to a job offer, just getting the interviews feels like a small win. And I've been trying to network more, reaching out to people in my field. That's been scary, but it's also led to some good conversations and potential leads.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples, Jian. Interviews and networking are key parts of the job search process, and the fact that you're putting yourself out there and making those connections is a sign of your capability and proactive approach. It's okay that it hasn't led to a job offer yet \u2013 that's something external that you can't fully control. What matters is that you're taking steps and making progress, which challenges the belief that you're not capable of succeeding.\n\nPatient: I guess you're right. It's hard to see those things as successes when I don't have a job yet, but I can see how they count as evidence against that core belief.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that it feels hard to see those things as successes, especially when you're dealing with the stress and uncertainty of the job search. That's where practicing a more balanced and compassionate perspective can be helpful. Let's try reframing those experiences as signs of your capability and resilience, rather than as failures. For example, instead of thinking \"I didn't get the job, so I'm not capable,\" try something like \"I put myself out there and gave it my best shot, which shows my determination and willingness to take risks.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's like looking at the situation from a different angle, focusing on what I can control and what I've done well, instead of just the outcome.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jian. Reframing the situation and focusing on your efforts and progress, rather than just the outcome, can help you develop a more balanced and adaptive perspective. It's a key part of modifying that core belief about your capability. As we continue with this process, it's also important to practice self-compassion and recognize that everyone faces challenges and setbacks \u2013 it doesn't mean you're not capable or that you won't succeed in the long run.\n\nTherapist: You're doing a great job of reframing your experiences and challenging that core belief, Jian. As we continue working on modifying this belief, it's also important to practice self-compassion. Can you think of a time recently when you were able to show yourself compassion, even in the face of a challenge or setback?\n\nPatient: One time comes to mind. A few weeks ago, I had an interview for a job that I really wanted. I prepared a lot, but during the interview, I felt like I stumbled over some of the questions. Afterwards, I was really hard on myself, thinking that I'd ruined my chances. But then I tried to take a step back and remind myself that it's okay to not be perfect, and that one interview doesn't define my whole career. I tried to focus on what I did well and what I could learn from the experience, instead of just beating myself up.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example of practicing self-compassion, Jian. It's so important to remember that everyone struggles and makes mistakes sometimes \u2013 it's part of being human. By focusing on what you did well and what you could learn, you were able to find a more balanced and kind perspective. That's a key part of modifying that core belief about your capability. As we continue with this process, I want to introduce a new technique called a \"self-compassion break.\" This involves taking a moment to acknowledge your struggle, remind yourself that struggles are part of the human experience, and then offering yourself some kindness or understanding. Would you like to try practicing this together?\n\nPatient: Sure, that sounds helpful. I could definitely use more practice with self-compassion.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's think of a recent situation where you were struggling or being hard on yourself. What comes to mind?\n\nPatient: Well, just the other day, I was working on a project for my photography hobby. I had this idea in my head of how I wanted it to turn out, but I just couldn't seem to get it right. I started feeling really frustrated and down on myself, thinking that I wasn't creative enough or talented enough.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to work with. Let's start by acknowledging the struggle. Can you try saying something like \"This is a moment of suffering\" or \"I'm having a tough time right now\"?\n\nPatient: Okay. \"I'm having a tough time with this photography project right now.\"\n\nTherapist: Good. Now, let's remind ourselves that struggles and imperfections are part of being human. Can you try saying something like \"Everyone feels this way sometimes\" or \"It's not just me \u2013 this is part of the human experience\"?\n\nPatient: \"It's not just me \u2013 everyone struggles with creative projects sometimes.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent. Now, let's offer ourselves some kindness or understanding. Can you try saying something like \"May I be kind to myself\" or \"I'm doing the best I can\"?\n\nPatient: \"I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough.\"\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Jian. You've just practiced a self-compassion break. How did that feel?\n\nPatient: It felt good, actually. It was like giving myself permission to struggle a bit, and reminding myself that it's okay.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Self-compassion is all about giving ourselves that permission and understanding. It's a powerful tool for modifying those negative core beliefs and developing a kinder, more balanced perspective towards ourselves. As you continue practicing this, along with the other techniques we've discussed, like examining the evidence and reframing experiences, you'll start to see shifts in those underlying beliefs.\n\nTherapist: You've made some great progress in modifying that core belief about your capability, Jian. As we wrap up today's session, let's take a moment to review what we've covered. We focused on strategies for modifying underlying beliefs, including examining the evidence for and against the belief, reframing experiences, and practicing self-compassion. You shared some great examples of how you've been able to challenge that belief about your capability, both in the job search and in your photography hobby. We also introduced the self-compassion break technique, which you practiced with the photography example. How are you feeling about what we covered today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling pretty good. It's helpful to have these strategies to work on that core belief. I know it'll take practice, but I feel like I have some tools to start shifting my perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Jian. Remember, modifying underlying beliefs is a process, and it's normal to have ups and downs along the way. The key is to keep practicing these techniques and being kind to yourself in the process. Speaking of practice, let's talk about some homework for this week. I'd like you to continue examining the evidence for and against that core belief about your capability, and practice reframing experiences related to your job search and photography hobby. I also encourage you to practice the self-compassion break technique whenever you notice yourself being hard on yourself. What do you think about that homework?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll definitely keep working on examining the evidence and reframing experiences. And I'll try to practice the self-compassion break too \u2013 I think that could be really helpful.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences with the homework next session. In the meantime, remember to be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. You're doing great work, Jian.\n\nPatient: Thanks, I appreciate the support. I'll do my best to keep practicing and being kind to myself.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jian. I have confidence in your ability to keep making progress. Let's plan to meet again next week at our usual time. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care until then!\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Strategies for modifying underlying beliefs, including examining the evidence for and against the belief, reframing experiences, and practicing self-compassion.
