  "transcript": "Patient: My current social support system is pretty limited. I have a few friends from my doctoral program, but we don't see each other very often. I also attend a veterans support group occasionally, but I find it hard to connect with people there. I feel like I don't really fit in anywhere, and that makes it difficult for me to reach out and build new relationships.\n\nTherapist: It's common for people experiencing depression to feel a sense of disconnection or isolation from others. Building and maintaining social connections can be challenging, especially when you're already feeling down. Let's explore some strategies that might help you gradually expand your support system and feel more connected to others.\n\nOne technique that can be helpful is behavioral activation. This involves intentionally engaging in activities that have the potential to bring you a sense of pleasure, accomplishment, or social connection, even if you don't initially feel motivated to do them. For example, you mentioned that you enjoy photography. Could you join a local photography club or attend a photography exhibit, with the goal of meeting people who share your interest?\n\nPatient: I guess I could try that. I've seen some photography meetups in my area, but I've always been hesitant to go because I worry that I won't fit in or that my skills aren't good enough.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how our thoughts can influence our behavior. The worry that you won't fit in or that your skills aren't good enough might be holding you back from engaging in an activity that could potentially bring you joy and social connection. Let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts, just like we did with the job rejection example earlier.\n\nWhat evidence do you have that your photography skills aren't good enough or that you wouldn't fit in with a photography group?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I don't have any concrete evidence. I've never really shared my photography with anyone outside of a few close friends, so I don't know how it compares to other people's work. And I haven't given the photography group a chance, so I can't say for sure that I wouldn't fit in.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jian. When we examine the evidence, we often find that our negative thoughts aren't entirely based in fact. Now, let's look at the evidence that supports the idea that you could fit in and that your photography skills are good enough.\n\nYou mentioned that you've been doing photography for a while now, and it's something you're passionate about. That in itself is a strong foundation for connecting with others who share that interest. Additionally, the fact that you completed a doctoral degree demonstrates that you have the ability to learn, grow, and master new skills. Those are transferable qualities that can help you develop your photography skills further and connect with others in the process.\n\nPatient: That's true. I guess I've been so focused on my perceived shortcomings that I haven't really considered my strengths and the potential for growth and connection.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Jian, and it's something we can continue to work on together. Another strategy that can be helpful in building social connections is to set small, achievable goals for yourself. For example, you could start by attending one photography meetup and setting a goal to introduce yourself to at least one person there. This can help you build confidence and momentum in expanding your social circle.\n\nPatient: That sounds manageable. I think I could start with a goal like that.\n\nTherapist: Great! As you work on building social connections, remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself. It's okay if progress feels slow or if you experience setbacks along the way. The important thing is that you keep trying and celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your encouragement and support. I'll try to keep that in mind as I work on expanding my social circle.",
