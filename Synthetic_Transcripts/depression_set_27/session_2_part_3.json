  "transcript": "Therapist: I understand that this process can be challenging, Jian. It's important that we work together to find strategies that feel manageable for you. Remember, small steps can lead to significant changes over time. I'm here to support you through this process.\n\nPatient: Thanks, I appreciate that. I just worry that I won't be able to keep up with the homework and everything.\n\nTherapist: It's normal to have concerns about the homework and the therapeutic process. Let's take a moment to discuss the purpose of homework in CBT and how we can tailor it to your needs. The goal of homework is to help you practice the skills we discuss in session and apply them to your daily life. It's not meant to be overwhelming or add more stress to your life.\n\nPatient: I guess I just don't want to fail at therapy too.\n\nTherapist: I hear your concern, Jian. In CBT, we don't view homework as something you can pass or fail. It's an opportunity to learn and grow. If you find a particular assignment challenging, that's valuable information for us to discuss in session. We can then problem-solve together and find ways to modify the homework to better suit your needs.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I just feel like I'm supposed to be able to do this on my own.\n\nTherapist: It's common to feel like you should be able to manage everything independently, but seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Therapy is a collaborative process, and my role is to support you in developing new skills and strategies. Remember, you've already demonstrated resilience and determination in many areas of your life, like completing your doctoral degree. Those same strengths will help you in therapy as well.\n\nPatient: I hadn't thought about it that way. So, what kind of homework do you think would be helpful for me?\n\nTherapist: Let's start by identifying some potential therapy goals. We can then develop homework assignments that align with those goals. Based on our discussions so far, some possible goals could include developing healthier coping strategies, improving your sleep hygiene, increasing your social engagement, and exploring career options. What thoughts do you have about these potential goals?\n\nPatient: Those all sound important. I think I'd like to focus on finding healthier ways to cope with my emotions and maybe trying to connect with people more.\n\nTherapist: Those are great goals, Jian. We can definitely work on developing coping strategies that feel manageable and effective for you. Regarding social engagement, we can explore ways to build connections that align with your interests and comfort level. For example, we could look into photography clubs or groups where you could meet people who share your passion.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of a photography club. I've always wanted to share my work with others who understand it.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful idea. Engaging in activities you enjoy with like-minded people can be a great way to build connections and improve your mood. As we continue our work together, we can discuss strategies for finding and participating in a photography club or similar groups.\n\nPatient: I'm a bit nervous about putting myself out there, but I'm willing to try.\n\nTherapist: It's natural to feel nervous about trying new things and meeting new people. We can work on developing strategies to manage that anxiety and take small steps towards your goals. Remember, you don't have to do anything that feels overwhelming or uncomfortable. We'll work at a pace that feels right for you.\n\nPatient: Okay, that makes me feel a bit better about it.",
