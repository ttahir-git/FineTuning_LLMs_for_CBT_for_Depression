You've made significant progress in recognizing the impact of your thoughts on your emotions and behaviors, and you're developing skills to modify those thoughts based on evidence.\n\nPatient: Thank you. It's been a challenging process, but I'm starting to see how my thoughts have been affecting me, and I'm learning how to change them.\n\nTherapist: Before we end our session, I want to check in with you about your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful after our discussion today. I know I still have work to do, but I feel like I have some tools to help me manage my job search stress better.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there may be ups and downs along the way. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: For homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the Downward Arrow Technique with any negative thoughts related to your job search.

We'll review your homework in our next session and continue working on modifying these beliefs.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll definitely work on that this week.\n\nTherapist: Great! If you have any questions or concerns while working on your homework, feel free to bring them up in our next session.\n\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's plan to meet again next week at our usual time.\n\nPatient: Sounds good.
