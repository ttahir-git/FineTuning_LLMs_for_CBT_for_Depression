  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job using the thought record to challenge the negative thought about not being good enough and never finding a job in your field. As we continue to practice this skill, you'll likely find it easier to identify and challenge negative thoughts as they arise. Now, I'd like to introduce a new technique called the Positive Data Log, which can help you accumulate evidence for new, more adaptive beliefs about yourself. The Positive Data Log involves actively seeking out and recording experiences that support your new beliefs, even if they seem small or insignificant at first. For example, if you want to develop the belief that you are capable and competent, you could record instances where you successfully complete a task, receive positive feedback, or learn a new skill. Over time, these pieces of evidence will help strengthen your new belief and make it easier to challenge negative thoughts when they arise. What do you think about trying this technique?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of actively looking for evidence to support new beliefs about myself. It's easy to get caught up in negative thoughts and overlook the positive experiences I have. I think the Positive Data Log could help me balance my perspective and build more confidence in myself.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find the Positive Data Log technique appealing. To start, let's identify a new belief you'd like to work on developing. Based on our discussion today, what belief would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to work on developing the belief that I am capable and have valuable skills, even if I haven't found a job yet.\n\nTherapist: That's a great belief to focus on, as it directly challenges the negative thought we discussed earlier. Now, let's brainstorm some examples of experiences that could serve as evidence for this new belief. What are some situations where you feel capable or have used your valuable skills?\n\nPatient: Well, I've completed several projects during my internships that required me to use my programming and problem-solving skills. I also helped my friend with a programming issue recently, and he appreciated my help. Additionally, I've been learning new skills through online courses to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies in my field.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent examples of experiences that support your new belief. As you continue to use the Positive Data Log, you'll likely find more evidence that reinforces the idea that you are capable and have valuable skills. Remember, the evidence doesn't have to be significant or groundbreaking; even small experiences can contribute to building a more positive and balanced belief about yourself. How do you feel about incorporating the Positive Data Log into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: I feel motivated to try the Positive Data Log. It's a simple technique that I can easily integrate into my day, and I think it will help me focus more on my strengths and accomplishments, rather than just my perceived failures or shortcomings.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude to have, Jian. As you practice using the Positive Data Log, you may find that your new belief becomes more automatic and easier to access when you're facing challenges or setbacks. It's also important to remember that building new beliefs takes time and consistent effort, so be patient with yourself as you work on developing this new perspective. Now, let's discuss how you can incorporate the Positive Data Log into your daily routine. What do you think would be a good way to remind yourself to record positive evidence throughout the day?",
