  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jian, it's great to see you again for session 7. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I completed the thought records and practiced active listening, which helped me feel more connected to others. However, I still struggle with reaching out to people, especially when it comes to the photography meetup. I haven't been able to gather the courage to ask someone to go on a photo walk with me.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the skills we discussed and that they've helped you feel more connected. Reaching out to others can be challenging, especially when it involves putting yourself out there. Let's explore this further. What thoughts or concerns come up for you when you think about asking someone from the photography meetup to go on a photo walk?\n\nPatient: I worry that they'll think I'm weird or too forward. I also fear that they'll say no, and I'll feel rejected. It's easier for me to just keep to myself and avoid the potential awkwardness or disappointment.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid concerns, and it's understandable to feel hesitant about putting yourself out there. Let's look at this through the lens of the CBT triangle, which illustrates the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In this case, your thoughts about potential rejection are leading to feelings of anxiety and fear, which in turn influence your behavior of avoiding reaching out. Does this resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that makes sense. I can see how my thoughts are holding me back from taking action and connecting with others.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Today, I'd like to focus on helping you challenge those thoughts and develop strategies for reaching out to others, despite the anxiety it may cause. We can also review your thought records and discuss any other concerns you'd like to address. What do you think about that plan?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'd like to work on building my confidence in social situations and finding ways to cope with the anxiety that comes up.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's add that to our agenda. So, we'll review your thought records, discuss strategies for challenging negative thoughts related to social interactions, and explore coping techniques for managing anxiety in social situations. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it. I'm looking forward to working on these issues.",
