  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great progress in modifying that core belief about your capability, Jian. As we wrap up today's session, let's take a moment to review what we've covered. We focused on strategies for modifying underlying beliefs, including examining the evidence for and against the belief, reframing experiences, and practicing self-compassion. You shared some great examples of how you've been able to challenge that belief about your capability, both in the job search and in your photography hobby. We also introduced the self-compassion break technique, which you practiced with the photography example. How are you feeling about what we covered today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling pretty good. It's helpful to have these strategies to work on that core belief. I know it'll take practice, but I feel like I have some tools to start shifting my perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Jian. Remember, modifying underlying beliefs is a process, and it's normal to have ups and downs along the way. The key is to keep practicing these techniques and being kind to yourself in the process. Speaking of practice, let's talk about some homework for this week. I'd like you to continue examining the evidence for and against that core belief about your capability, and practice reframing experiences related to your job search and photography hobby. I also encourage you to practice the self-compassion break technique whenever you notice yourself being hard on yourself. What do you think about that homework?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll definitely keep working on examining the evidence and reframing experiences. And I'll try to practice the self-compassion break too \u2013 I think that could be really helpful.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences with the homework next session. In the meantime, remember to be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. You're doing great work, Jian.\n\nPatient: Thanks, I appreciate the support. I'll do my best to keep practicing and being kind to myself.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jian. I have confidence in your ability to keep making progress. Let's plan to meet again next week at our usual time. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care until then!\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Strategies for modifying underlying beliefs, including examining the evidence for and against the belief, reframing experiences, and practicing self-compassion.
