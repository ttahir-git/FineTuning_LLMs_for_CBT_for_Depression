  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jian, it's great to see you for our 20th session today. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I want you to feel comfortable correcting me if that happens. Additionally, as an AI, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, it's important to reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our interactions are text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so I encourage you to express your thoughts and feelings as openly as possible. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. I'm comfortable with the support you can provide.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for your understanding, Jian. I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: I've been doing okay. I've been trying to apply the techniques we've discussed, like examining the evidence for and against my core belief about not being capable. It's still a challenge, but I think I'm making some progress. I had a job interview last week, and while I didn't get the position, I tried to reframe it as a learning experience rather than a failure.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been applying the techniques we've discussed and that you're noticing some progress. Reframing the job interview as a learning experience is a significant step in challenging your core belief about your capabilities. How did it feel to approach it from that perspective?\n\nPatient: It felt different, but in a good way. I usually get really down on myself when I don't get a job, but this time I tried to focus on what I learned from the interview and how I can improve for the next one.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful insight, Jian. Shifting your perspective and focusing on growth rather than perceived failures is a key part of modifying those underlying beliefs. I'm proud of you for making that effort. How have you been doing with the other homework assignments, such as practicing the self-compassion break technique?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to practice self-compassion, but it's still difficult for me. I often catch myself being self-critical, especially when it comes to my photography hobby. I get frustrated when my photos don't turn out the way I want them to.\n\nTherapist: Self-compassion can be challenging, especially when we have high expectations for ourselves. Remember that it's a practice, and it's okay if it feels difficult at times. When you notice yourself being self-critical about your photography, can you try to take a step back and offer yourself some understanding and kindness, just as you would to a good friend who was struggling?\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just hard to extend that same compassion to myself sometimes.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that it feels challenging, Jian. We often have a harsher inner critic for ourselves than we do for others. As we continue to practice self-compassion, it will gradually become more natural. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on? We could review your experience with the homework, continue practicing techniques for modifying underlying beliefs, explore your progress and challenges in shifting your core belief about capability, or discuss any other concerns or goals that have come up for you.",
