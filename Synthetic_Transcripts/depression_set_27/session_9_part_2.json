  "transcript": "Patient: I can try some of those self-soothing activities, like listening to music or taking a warm bath. I think I struggle with allowing myself to take that time for self-care.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jian. Many people find it challenging to prioritize self-care, especially when they're dealing with depression. It's essential to remember that taking care of yourself is not selfish; it's necessary for your overall well-being. Let's set a goal for you to engage in at least one self-soothing activity each day this week. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I think that's a good goal. I'll try to make time for self-care, even if it's just a few minutes each day.\n\nTherapist: Excellent, Jian. Remember, starting small is perfectly fine. The key is to be consistent and build self-soothing into your daily routine. Now, let's discuss your progress and challenges in building social connections. How have you been feeling about reaching out to others and sharing more in the veterans support group?\n\nPatient: It's still challenging for me. I often feel like I don't have anything valuable to contribute, or that people won't understand what I'm going through.\n\nTherapist: Those are common concerns, Jian. Let's explore them further. Can you give me an example of a situation where you felt this way in the support group?\n\nPatient: Last week, someone was talking about their struggles with finding a job after leaving the military. I wanted to share my own experience with unemployment, but I hesitated because I thought they might think I was trying to compare my situation to theirs.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Jian. It sounds like you were concerned about how your contribution would be perceived. Let's examine this thought using the downward arrow technique. If you did share your experience and the person thought you were comparing your situation to theirs, what would that mean to you?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not really understood or accepted in the group. It would make me feel like an outsider.\n\nTherapist: And if you felt like an outsider, what would that mean about you?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I don't belong anywhere, and that there's something wrong with me.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for being so open, Jian. It seems that this situation taps into a deeper belief about belonging and self-worth. These core beliefs can be challenging to change, but we can start by examining the evidence for and against them. Let's look at your experience in the photography club. Did you feel like an outsider there, or did you find some sense of connection?\n\nPatient: When I pushed myself to talk to that person at the photography club, I did feel a sense of connection. We had a shared interest, and they seemed to understand my perspective on photography.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Jian. It shows that even when you feel like an outsider, there are situations where you can find connection and understanding. Let's continue to gather evidence that challenges your core belief about not belonging. I encourage you to share a little more in the veterans support group this week, even if it feels uncomfortable. Remember, you don't have to share your deepest struggles right away. Start with something small, like a common interest or a brief experience, and see how people respond. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I can try that. I'll aim to share something small in the next support group meeting, and pay attention to how people respond.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Jian. Remember, challenging core beliefs takes time and practice, but each small step counts. I'm here to support you through this process.\n\nNow, let's discuss your job search and the pressure you feel to succeed in your career. Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind regarding this?\n\nPatient: I feel like I'm not living up to my potential, and that I'm disappointing my family. They sacrificed so much for me to have opportunities, and I feel like I'm wasting them. I worry that if I don't find a job soon, I'll be seen as a failure.",
