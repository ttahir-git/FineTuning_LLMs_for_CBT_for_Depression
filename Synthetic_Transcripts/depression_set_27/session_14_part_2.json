  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned that you completed a few thought records but found it challenging. Can you walk me through one of the thought records you did, and we can explore what made it difficult?\n\nPatient: Sure. One situation that triggered me was when I received a rejection email from a job I applied to. My initial thoughts were \"I'm never going to find a job\" and \"I'm not good enough.\" I felt really discouraged and hopeless, like an 8 out of 10. When I tried to look for evidence against these thoughts, I struggled to come up with anything convincing. I could only think of one piece of evidence, which was that I have my degree and some experience. But it didn't feel like enough.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing this, Jian. It's not uncommon to find it challenging to come up with evidence against deeply held negative beliefs. The fact that you were able to identify one piece of evidence is a good start. Let's see if we can expand on that. What would you say to a friend who was in a similar situation and expressed the same thoughts?\n\nPatient: I guess I would remind them that job rejections are a normal part of the process and don't necessarily reflect their worth or abilities. I might also point out that they have other strengths and qualities that make them employable, even if they don't see it themselves.\n\nTherapist: That's a great perspective, Jian. You're able to recognize the distortion in your friend's thinking and offer a more balanced view. This is the same approach we want to take with your own thoughts. When you're able to step back and look at the situation objectively, what other evidence can you find that challenges the thoughts \"I'm never going to find a job\" and \"I'm not good enough\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose I could consider the fact that I've had interviews in the past, even if they didn't lead to a job offer. That suggests that I have some qualifications that employers find valuable. And I have been successful in other areas of my life, like completing my degree and maintaining some friendships, even if it's difficult. So, maybe I'm not entirely without worth.\n\nTherapist: Excellent work, Jian. You're starting to gather more evidence against your negative thoughts. This is a crucial step in cognitive restructuring. Remember, the goal is not to replace negative thoughts with overly positive ones but to find a more balanced and realistic perspective. How does considering this evidence affect the intensity of the emotions you felt initially?\n\nPatient: When I think about the evidence, the hopelessness and discouragement feel less intense. Maybe more like a 5 out of 10 instead of an 8.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, Jian. By examining the evidence and generating alternative thoughts, you're able to reduce the intensity of your negative emotions. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the easier it will become. Let's continue to work on this together. Are there any other situations from your homework that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: One other situation that was challenging for me was when I tried to reach out to a friend to make plans, and they didn't respond right away. I started thinking that they didn't want to spend time with me and that I was bothering them. It made me feel rejected and anxious, like a 7 out of 10.\n\nTherapist: I understand how that situation could trigger those thoughts and feelings, Jian. Let's apply the same process we just used to this scenario. What evidence do you have that your friend doesn't want to spend time with you or that you're bothering them?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the main evidence is that they didn't respond to my message right away. But now that I think about it, there could be many reasons for that. They could be busy or haven't had a chance to check their messages.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point, Jian. There are many possible explanations for your friend's delayed response, and it may have nothing to do with you personally. What evidence do you have that challenges the thoughts that they don't want to spend time with you or that you're bothering them?\n\nPatient: I suppose the fact that we've been friends for a while and have had good times together in the past suggests that they do value our friendship on some level. And they have responded positively to my messages before, even if not always right away.\n\nTherapist: Great, Jian. You're able to identify evidence that challenges your negative thoughts about your friend's perception of you. How does considering this evidence affect the intensity of the rejection and anxiety you felt initially?\n\nPatient: When I think about the evidence, the rejection and anxiety feel less intense. Maybe more like a 4 out of 10 instead of a 7.\n\nTherapist: That's another significant shift, Jian. By examining the evidence and generating alternative thoughts, you're able to reduce the intensity of your negative emotions in this situation as well. This is a powerful skill that you're developing. The more you practice it, the more automatic it will become.\n\nPatient: I can see how this skill could be helpful, but it's still challenging for me to do it in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts and emotions.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid point, Jian. It's often easier to examine our thoughts and find alternative perspectives when we're in a calm state of mind. One strategy that can help is to create a coping card with some of the evidence and alternative thoughts you've identified. You can keep this card with you and refer to it when you're feeling overwhelmed. Would you like to create a coping card together now?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that could be helpful. How do we go about creating one?\n\nTherapist: To create a coping card, we'll write down some of the key evidence and alternative thoughts you've identified on a small card that you can keep with you. We can use the situations we've discussed today as examples. For the job rejection situation, what evidence and alternative thoughts would you like to include on your coping card?\n\nPatient: I could write down that job rejections are a normal part of the process and don't necessarily reflect my worth or abilities. And that I have other strengths and qualities that make me employable, even if I don't always see them myself.\n\nTherapist: Excellent, Jian. Those are great points to include on your coping card. What about for the situation with your friend? What evidence and alternative thoughts would you like to write down?\n\nPatient: For that situation, I could write down that there could be many reasons for my friend's delayed response, and it may have nothing to do with me personally. And that our history of friendship and past positive interactions suggest that they do value our relationship, even if they don't always respond right away.\n\nTherapist: Those are perfect points to include on your coping card, Jian. By having these evidence and alternative thoughts written down, you'll have a tangible reminder to refer to when you're feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts and emotions. You can pull out your coping card and read through the points to help you challenge your negative thoughts in the moment.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can see how having a physical reminder could be helpful when I'm struggling to come up with alternative thoughts on my own.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jian. The coping card is a tool to help you access the evidence and alternative thoughts you've identified more easily, especially in moments when it's difficult to think clearly. As we continue to work together, you can add to your coping card with new evidence and alternative thoughts that you find helpful.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It feels good to have a concrete tool I can use when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find the coping card helpful, Jian. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate negative thoughts and emotions entirely but to find more balanced and realistic perspectives that reduce their intensity and make them more manageable. The coping card is one tool to help you do that.",
