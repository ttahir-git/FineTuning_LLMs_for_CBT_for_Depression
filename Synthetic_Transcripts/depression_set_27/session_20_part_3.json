  "transcript": "Therapist: Jian, you've been doing an excellent job of applying the CBT skills we've discussed, even when it's challenging. I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in recognizing your thought patterns and actively working to modify them. This is a crucial part of the therapy process.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. It's been a lot of work, but I do feel like I'm starting to see some changes in how I think about myself and my capabilities.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and those changes are a direct result of your dedication and effort. As we continue to work on modifying your core belief about capability, it's essential to remember that progress isn't always linear. There will be ups and downs, and that's okay. What matters is that you keep practicing these skills and techniques, even when it feels difficult.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just frustrating when I feel like I'm taking two steps forward and one step back sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid feeling, Jian. It's normal to experience setbacks and challenges along the way. When you find yourself feeling frustrated, try to practice some self-compassion and remind yourself that setbacks are a natural part of the learning process. You wouldn't expect yourself to master a new skill overnight, and the same applies to modifying long-held beliefs.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just need to be patient with myself and keep practicing.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Patience and persistence are key. Remember, you've already made significant progress, and that's something to be proud of. As we continue to work together, you'll likely find it easier to catch and challenge those negative thoughts about your capability.\n\nPatient: I hope so. It's just hard to break out of that mindset sometimes, especially when it comes to my career and feeling like I'm not living up to my potential.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging that can be, Jian. Our careers and sense of purpose are closely tied to our identities, and it's common to have high expectations for ourselves in those areas. When you find yourself feeling like you're not living up to your potential, try to take a step back and examine the evidence, just like we've practiced.\n\nPatient: I'll try to do that. It's just hard not to compare myself to others sometimes and feel like I'm falling behind.\n\nTherapist: Comparing ourselves to others is a common cognitive distortion called \"social comparison.\" While it's natural to look at others for reference, it often leads to feelings of inadequacy or failure because we're not seeing the full picture. Everyone has their own unique path and challenges, and comparing ourselves to others doesn't take that into account.\n\nPatient: That's true. I guess I need to focus more on my own progress and less on what others are doing.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jian. Focusing on your own growth and progress is much more productive than comparing yourself to others. Remember, your value and worth are not determined by external factors like your career or achievements. You are inherently valuable and worthy, regardless of your perceived successes or failures.\n\nPatient: I'm trying to believe that, but it's a hard concept to internalize sometimes.\n\nTherapist: It can be challenging to internalize, especially if we've grown up with messages that tie our worth to external factors. That's why we've been working on modifying those underlying beliefs and developing a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself. As you continue to practice these skills, it will become easier to challenge those negative thoughts and beliefs.\n\nPatient: I hope so. I just want to feel more confident in myself and my abilities.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Jian, and it's something we can continue to work towards together. Remember, confidence is built through action and facing challenges, even when it feels uncomfortable. Every time you catch and challenge a negative thought about your capability, you're building that confidence and reinforcing a more balanced and realistic view of yourself.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just a process, I guess.\n\nTherapist: It is a process, and you're doing an excellent job of engaging in that process. As we continue to work together, we'll keep practicing these skills and techniques, and you'll likely find it easier to challenge those negative thoughts and beliefs. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are a natural part of the learning process. What matters is that you keep practicing and applying these skills, even when it feels difficult.",
