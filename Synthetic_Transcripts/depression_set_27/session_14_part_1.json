  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jian, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned, but it's been challenging. I completed a few thought records, but I struggled to consistently engage in behavioral activation activities. I attended one networking event, but I felt really anxious and out of place. I also reached out to a friend, but we haven't made plans to meet up yet. I've been using the Positive Data Log, but it's hard to find evidence that supports the belief that I'm capable and have valuable skills to offer.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Jian. It's common to face challenges when trying to implement new skills and strategies. Let's explore what made it difficult for you to engage in the behavioral activation activities. What thoughts or feelings came up for you when you attended the networking event or reached out to your friend?\n\nPatient: When I was at the networking event, I kept thinking that everyone else was more qualified and confident than me. I felt like I didn't belong there and that I wouldn't be able to contribute anything meaningful to the conversations. And when I reached out to my friend, I was worried that they wouldn't want to spend time with me because I've been so withdrawn lately.\n\nTherapist: Those are understandable thoughts and feelings, Jian. It's common to experience self-doubt and worry about how others perceive us, especially when we're struggling with depression. Let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that you don't belong at networking events or that your friend doesn't want to spend time with you?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I don't have concrete evidence that I don't belong at networking events. It's more of a feeling. And my friend did respond positively when I reached out, even though we haven't made plans yet. So maybe I'm jumping to conclusions based on my emotions rather than facts.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jian. You're recognizing that your thoughts may not always be based on evidence. This is a key part of cognitive restructuring \u2013 examining the evidence for and against our thoughts and generating alternative perspectives. Let's continue to practice this skill today. What would be a more balanced thought about the networking event and your friend?\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought would be that everyone at the networking event is there to learn and connect, just like me. And my friend's positive response shows that they do value our relationship, even if we haven't made plans yet.\n\nTherapist: Excellent work, Jian. You're developing the skill of generating alternative thoughts based on evidence. This is an important step in challenging negative thoughts and beliefs. Today, I'd like to focus on a few key areas. First, let's review your experience with the homework in more detail and problem-solve any challenges you faced. Then, we can practice more thought records and behavioral activation strategies. We can also explore your progress and challenges in managing job search stress and building social connections. Does this agenda sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'd also like to talk more about how my cultural background and family expectations might be influencing my thoughts and beliefs. I think that's an important piece of the puzzle for me.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jian. Exploring the cultural and familial context of your thoughts and beliefs is crucial. We can definitely make that a priority in today's session. Let's start by reviewing your experience with the homework in more detail. Can you tell me more about the thought records you completed and any challenges you faced with them?",
