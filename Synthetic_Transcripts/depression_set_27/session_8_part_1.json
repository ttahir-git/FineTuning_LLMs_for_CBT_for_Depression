  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jian, it's great to see you again for our eighth session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you need immediate support, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Lastly, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to better support you within these limitations.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me so far. I'm looking forward to today's session.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Jian. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been doing alright. I've been trying to practice the coping strategies we discussed, like deep breathing and grounding, when I feel anxious in social situations. It's been helpful, but I still struggle with negative thoughts and feelings of isolation at times.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been practicing the coping strategies and finding them helpful. It's also normal to still experience negative thoughts and feelings of isolation as you work through this process. Can you tell me more about the negative thoughts you've been experiencing?\n\nPatient: Well, I often find myself thinking that I'm not good enough or that people don't really want to connect with me. It makes it hard to reach out and build new friendships.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts can be really challenging and impact your ability to connect with others. I'm glad you're bringing them up today. Before we dive deeper into that, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I'd like to focus on strategies for challenging those negative thoughts and maybe discuss some ways to build more social connections.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. We can definitely work on challenging those negative thoughts and explore ways to build social connections. I'd also like to follow up on the homework we discussed last session and see how that went for you. Does that sound okay?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's start by reviewing the thought records you completed since our last session. Can you share one of the situations you wrote about and the negative thoughts you identified?",
