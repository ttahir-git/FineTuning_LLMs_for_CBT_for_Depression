  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the great work you've done in applying cognitive restructuring to your job interview experience and exploring strategies for building social connections. Remember, progress takes time, and setbacks are a normal part of the journey. Keep practicing the skills we've discussed, and be patient with yourself along the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you for your support and guidance. It's not easy, but I'm committed to keeping at it.\n\nTherapist: Before we end, let's do a quick check-in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful than when we started, but I know I still have a lot of work to do. I'm nervous about putting myself out there socially, but I understand the importance of taking small steps and challenging my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're feeling more hopeful, Jian, and it's okay to feel nervous about taking social risks. Remember to set small, achievable goals and practice self-compassion along the way. For homework, I'd like you to continue working on thought records, focusing on situations related to job search stress and social interactions. Try to identify and challenge any negative thoughts that arise, and practice generating alternative thoughts based on the evidence.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll do my best to keep up with the thought records and challenge my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Great. In addition to the thought records, I'd also like you to set one small goal related to building social connections, such as attending a photography meetup or initiating a conversation with someone new at the veterans support group. Remember to celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem.\n\nPatient: I'll try to set a small social goal for the week and follow through with it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Jian. I'm confident that with continued practice and small steps, you'll make progress in managing job search stress and building social connections. Remember, our next session is scheduled for [insert date and time]. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your support. I'll see you at our next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Managing job search stress, building social connections, practicing cognitive restructuring, setting small goals, and developing self-compassion.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Thought records, cognitive restructuring, examining evidence for and against negative thoughts, generating alternative thoughts, setting small social goals, and practicing self-compassion.
