  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jian, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the Downward Arrow Technique and cognitive restructuring when I notice myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns. It's not always easy, but I think it's helping a bit. I've also been using the coping card we created, and it's been a good reminder of my strengths and accomplishments.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed and finding some benefit from the coping card. Remember, it's normal for it to feel challenging at times, but the more you practice, the more natural it will become. Can you share an example of a time when you used the Downward Arrow Technique or cognitive restructuring since our last session?\n\nPatient: Sure. Earlier this week, I started feeling really down about my job search. I caught myself thinking, \"I'll never find a job in my field.\" So, I tried using the Downward Arrow Technique. I asked myself what that thought meant about me, and I realized it was tied to my belief that I'm a failure. Then, I tried to challenge that belief by looking at the evidence, like the fact that I completed my doctoral degree, which is a big accomplishment. It didn't make the job search stress go away completely, but it helped me feel a bit more balanced.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example of putting the skills we've discussed into practice. You did a great job of identifying the negative thought, using the Downward Arrow Technique to uncover the underlying belief, and then challenging that belief with evidence. It's okay that it didn't make the stress disappear completely \u2013 the goal is to find more balance and perspective, which it sounds like you did. How did you feel after going through that process?\n\nPatient: I felt a bit lighter, I guess. It was like I could see things from a different angle, instead of just getting stuck in that negative spiral. It gave me a bit of hope that even if the job search is tough, it doesn't mean I'm a failure.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Jian. Shifting your perspective and finding hope, even in challenging situations, is a big part of building resilience. You're doing a great job of applying these skills in your daily life. Now, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on? We could review your experience with the coping card and Downward Arrow Technique in more depth, continue practicing cognitive restructuring, explore your progress and challenges in modifying underlying beliefs, or discuss any other concerns or goals that have come up for you.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on modifying underlying beliefs. I'm starting to see how some of my core beliefs, like the idea that I'm a failure, are impacting my thoughts and feelings in a lot of areas of my life. I want to work on shifting those beliefs, but it feels daunting. Can we talk about strategies for doing that?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's a great topic to focus on today. Modifying underlying beliefs can feel daunting at first, but there are several strategies we can use to approach it. One powerful technique is to examine the evidence for and against the belief, similar to what you did with the job search example you shared earlier. Another strategy is to conduct behavioral experiments to test out the validity of the belief. We can also work on developing new, more adaptive beliefs to replace the old ones. Let's start by identifying one core belief you'd like to work on modifying. What comes to mind?",
