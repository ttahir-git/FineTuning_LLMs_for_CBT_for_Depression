  "transcript": "Therapist: You're doing a great job of reframing your experiences and challenging that core belief, Jian. As we continue working on modifying this belief, it's also important to practice self-compassion. Can you think of a time recently when you were able to show yourself compassion, even in the face of a challenge or setback?\n\nPatient: One time comes to mind. A few weeks ago, I had an interview for a job that I really wanted. I prepared a lot, but during the interview, I felt like I stumbled over some of the questions. Afterwards, I was really hard on myself, thinking that I'd ruined my chances. But then I tried to take a step back and remind myself that it's okay to not be perfect, and that one interview doesn't define my whole career. I tried to focus on what I did well and what I could learn from the experience, instead of just beating myself up.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example of practicing self-compassion, Jian. It's so important to remember that everyone struggles and makes mistakes sometimes \u2013 it's part of being human. By focusing on what you did well and what you could learn, you were able to find a more balanced and kind perspective. That's a key part of modifying that core belief about your capability. As we continue with this process, I want to introduce a new technique called a \"self-compassion break.\" This involves taking a moment to acknowledge your struggle, remind yourself that struggles are part of the human experience, and then offering yourself some kindness or understanding. Would you like to try practicing this together?\n\nPatient: Sure, that sounds helpful. I could definitely use more practice with self-compassion.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's think of a recent situation where you were struggling or being hard on yourself. What comes to mind?\n\nPatient: Well, just the other day, I was working on a project for my photography hobby. I had this idea in my head of how I wanted it to turn out, but I just couldn't seem to get it right. I started feeling really frustrated and down on myself, thinking that I wasn't creative enough or talented enough.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to work with. Let's start by acknowledging the struggle. Can you try saying something like \"This is a moment of suffering\" or \"I'm having a tough time right now\"?\n\nPatient: Okay. \"I'm having a tough time with this photography project right now.\"\n\nTherapist: Good. Now, let's remind ourselves that struggles and imperfections are part of being human. Can you try saying something like \"Everyone feels this way sometimes\" or \"It's not just me \u2013 this is part of the human experience\"?\n\nPatient: \"It's not just me \u2013 everyone struggles with creative projects sometimes.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent. Now, let's offer ourselves some kindness or understanding. Can you try saying something like \"May I be kind to myself\" or \"I'm doing the best I can\"?\n\nPatient: \"I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough.\"\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Jian. You've just practiced a self-compassion break. How did that feel?\n\nPatient: It felt good, actually. It was like giving myself permission to struggle a bit, and reminding myself that it's okay.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Self-compassion is all about giving ourselves that permission and understanding. It's a powerful tool for modifying those negative core beliefs and developing a kinder, more balanced perspective towards ourselves. As you continue practicing this, along with the other techniques we've discussed, like examining the evidence and reframing experiences, you'll start to see shifts in those underlying beliefs.",
