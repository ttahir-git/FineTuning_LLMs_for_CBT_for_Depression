  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I think addressing the obstacles with the homework and discussing the job interview stress are the most important topics for me right now.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can prioritize those topics. Let's start by exploring the challenges you faced with the thought records and Positive Data Log. Can you tell me more about what made it difficult to complete them consistently?\n\nPatient: I think part of it is that I get caught up in my negative thoughts, and it's hard to break away from them to actually write them down. I also struggle with finding evidence against my negative thoughts. It feels like the negative thoughts are so strong that it's hard to believe anything else.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jian. It's common for negative thoughts to feel very powerful and convincing, especially when we're feeling depressed. The process of challenging these thoughts through thought records and the Positive Data Log is a skill that takes practice. Let's look at a specific example from your thought records. Can you share a situation where you had trouble finding evidence against your negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: Sure, I had a thought record from a few days ago when I was applying for a job online. My automatic thought was, \"I'm not qualified for this job, and they'll never hire me.\" I had a hard time coming up with evidence against that thought because I kept thinking about my lack of experience and how competitive the job market is.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. When we're challenging negative thoughts, it's essential to look for evidence that might not be immediately apparent. In this case, what are some reasons an employer might consider hiring you, even if you don't have the exact experience they're looking for?\n\nPatient: Well, I do have my doctoral degree, and I've worked on some projects during my studies that are relevant to the job. I'm also a quick learner and have strong problem-solving skills.\n\nTherapist: Those are great points, Jian. Your education, relevant projects, and transferable skills like problem-solving are all evidence against the thought that you're not qualified. It's also important to remember that employers often consider potential and a willingness to learn, not just specific experience. How does considering this evidence affect your belief in the original negative thought?\n\nPatient: When I think about it that way, I guess the negative thought doesn't seem as true. I still feel like I might not be the most qualified candidate, but I can see that there are reasons why an employer might consider me.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. Challenging negative thoughts doesn't always mean completely dismissing them, but rather finding a more balanced perspective. It's okay to acknowledge that you might not be the most qualified candidate while also recognizing your strengths and the value you could bring to the role.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I think I've been getting stuck in all-or-nothing thinking, where I feel like I have to be the perfect candidate, or else I have no chance at all.\n\nTherapist: You've identified a common cognitive distortion called \"all-or-nothing thinking\" or \"black-and-white thinking.\" This type of thinking can make us feel hopeless and discouraged because it doesn't allow for any middle ground. In reality, most situations are more nuanced. Can you think of other examples where you might be falling into this all-or-nothing thinking pattern?\n\nPatient: I think I do this a lot with my job search in general. I feel like if I don't get a job in my field right away, I'm a failure. But I know that it often takes time and multiple applications to find the right fit.\n\nTherapist: That's another great example. Recognizing these patterns is an important step in being able to challenge them. As we continue with the thought records and Positive Data Log, let's pay special attention to any all-or-nothing thoughts that come up. We can work on finding evidence for more balanced, realistic thoughts.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds helpful. I'll try to be more aware of when I'm falling into that type of thinking.\n\nTherapist: Great! As you practice, it will become easier to catch these thoughts and challenge them. Remember, the goal is not to get rid of negative thoughts altogether but to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and discuss the job interview you mentioned earlier. You said you thought it went well, but the waiting and uncertainty have been stressful. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling and coping with this stress?",
