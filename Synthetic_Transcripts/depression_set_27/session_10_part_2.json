  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I don't have anything else to add at the moment.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's start by reviewing your experience with the Positive Data Log. Can you share some of the evidence you've collected for your new beliefs?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to write down at least one piece of positive evidence each day. For example, last week I helped a friend with a programming problem, and he thanked me for my help. I wrote that down as evidence that I am capable and have valuable skills, even if I haven't found a job yet.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of using the Positive Data Log. Recognizing and recording positive experiences, even small ones, can help challenge the negative beliefs you hold about yourself. How did it feel to write down that evidence?\n\nPatient: It felt good to acknowledge something positive about myself. I often focus on my failures and shortcomings, so it was nice to have a reminder that I do have strengths and abilities.\n\nTherapist: Acknowledging your strengths and abilities is an essential part of building self-confidence. As you continue using the Positive Data Log, you'll likely find more evidence that supports your new, more balanced beliefs about yourself. Now, let's discuss your progress and challenges in building social connections and sharing in the veterans support group. How has that been going?\n\nPatient: It's been challenging, but I've been trying to push myself out of my comfort zone. Last week, I shared a little bit about my struggle with finding a job and the pressure I feel to succeed. It wasn't easy, but the group was supportive, and it felt good to know that I'm not alone in my struggles.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant step forward, Jian. Sharing your experiences and vulnerabilities with others can be difficult, but it's also a powerful way to build connections and realize that you're not alone. How did the group respond to your sharing?\n\nPatient: They were really supportive. A few people shared their own experiences with job searching and the pressure they felt to succeed. It helped me feel less isolated and more understood.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. Connecting with others who have similar experiences can be incredibly validating and comforting. As you continue to share in the group, you may find that your relationships deepen, and you feel more supported. Now, let's explore any developments in your job search and how you're managing the pressure to succeed. Have there been any updates or changes since our last session?\n\nPatient: I've been applying to jobs and had a couple of interviews, but I haven't had any offers yet. It's been discouraging at times, and I find myself getting caught up in negative thoughts about my abilities and future.\n\nTherapist: Job searching can be a challenging and emotionally taxing process. It's common to experience discouragement and self-doubt during this time. Let's explore some of those negative thoughts using a thought record. Can you share a specific situation that triggered negative thoughts about your abilities and future?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I had an interview for a job that I thought I was well-suited for. I prepared thoroughly and felt like I did well in the interview. However, a few days later, I received an email saying they had chosen another candidate. I immediately started thinking that I'm not good enough and that I'll never find a job in my field.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that experience, Jian. Let's break it down using a thought record. The situation was receiving the email informing you that another candidate was chosen. What emotions did you experience in that moment, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt disappointed, frustrated, and hopeless. The disappointment was probably around 80, frustration around 75, and hopelessness around 85.\n\nTherapist: Those are strong emotions to experience. Now, let's identify the most prominent automatic thought you had in that situation. What thought stands out to you the most?\n\nPatient: The thought that stands out the most is \"I'm not good enough, and I'll never find a job in my field.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a powerful thought that likely contributed to the intense emotions you experienced. Now, let's examine the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not good enough and will never find a job in your field?\n\nPatient: Well, I haven't been able to find a job despite applying and interviewing for several positions. I also compare myself to my peers who seem to be more successful in their careers.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid points, and I understand how they can contribute to the belief that you're not good enough. Now, let's look at the evidence against that thought. What evidence do you have that challenges the idea that you're not good enough and will never find a job in your field?\n\nPatient: I have a strong educational background, and I graduated from a reputable program. I also have some work experience from internships and projects I've worked on. And, as we discussed earlier, I've received positive feedback from others, like when I helped my friend with a programming problem.\n\nTherapist: Those are significant pieces of evidence that challenge the negative thought. It's essential to consider both sides of the evidence to develop a more balanced perspective. Based on the evidence for and against the thought, let's generate an alternative thought that is more balanced and realistic. What might that alternative thought be?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be that while I haven't found a job yet, I have the education, skills, and experience that make me a qualified candidate. It may take time and persistence, but I believe I will eventually find a job in my field.\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic thought. Notice how it acknowledges the challenges you've faced while also recognizing your strengths and abilities. How do you feel when you consider this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit more hopeful and less discouraged. The intensity of the disappointment, frustration, and hopelessness has decreased. Disappointment is now around 60, frustration around 50, and hopelessness around 40.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in your emotional state, Jian. By examining the evidence and generating an alternative thought, you've been able to reduce the intensity of the negative emotions you were experiencing. This is a great example of how challenging negative thoughts can help improve your mood and overall well-being.",
