  "transcript": "Therapist: Jian, I'm glad we've been able to create a coping card with some evidence and alternative thoughts that you can use when you're feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts and emotions. As we continue to work together, we can add to this card and refine the strategies that work best for you.\n\nPatient: I appreciate that. It's helpful to have a tangible tool to refer to when I'm struggling. I'm curious about how my cultural background and family expectations might be influencing my thoughts and beliefs. Can we explore that more?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jian. Our cultural and familial context can have a significant impact on the way we think about ourselves and the world around us. Let's start by examining some of the messages you received growing up about success, achievement, and self-worth. What kinds of expectations did your family and culture have for you?\n\nPatient: Well, in my family and culture, there's a lot of emphasis on academic and professional success. My parents always pushed me to excel in school and expected me to pursue a high-paying, prestigious career. They sacrificed a lot for me to have opportunities they didn't have, so I feel like I owe it to them to succeed.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience for many people from immigrant families, Jian. The pressure to succeed academically and professionally can be intense, and it's understandable that you feel a sense of obligation to your parents. How do you think these expectations have influenced your thoughts and beliefs about yourself?\n\nPatient: I think I've internalized the idea that my worth is tied to my achievements. If I'm not succeeding in my career or meeting my family's expectations, I feel like a failure and a disappointment. It's hard for me to separate my self-worth from my external accomplishments.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jian. This belief that your worth is tied to your achievements is a common one, and it can be a source of significant distress. In CBT, we call this kind of belief an intermediate belief \u2013 it's a rule or assumption that we have about ourselves and the world. These intermediate beliefs are often influenced by our core beliefs, which are deeper, more fundamental beliefs about ourselves.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. So, what would be an example of a core belief that could be underlying this intermediate belief about achievement and self-worth?\n\nTherapist: One possible core belief could be \"I'm not good enough.\" This belief might be fueling the intermediate belief that your worth is tied to your achievements. If you believe at a core level that you're not good enough, you might feel like you need to constantly prove yourself through external accomplishments to feel worthy.\n\nPatient: That resonates with me. I do often feel like I'm not good enough, no matter how much I achieve. It's like I'm always chasing this impossible standard of perfection.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how core beliefs and intermediate beliefs can work together to maintain negative patterns of thinking and behavior. The good news is that we can work on challenging and reframing these beliefs through the same process we've been using with your automatic thoughts.\n\nPatient: That's encouraging. How would we go about challenging and reframing these deeper beliefs?\n\nTherapist: One strategy is to use the downward arrow technique. This involves asking yourself a series of questions to get at the core belief underlying a particular thought or belief. For example, if you have the thought \"I'm a failure because I haven't found a job yet,\" you might ask yourself, \"What would it mean about me if I never found a job?\" And then, \"What would that mean about me as a person?\" We keep going until we arrive at the core belief.\n\nPatient: I see. So, it's like peeling back the layers of an onion to get to the core.\n\nTherapist: That's a great analogy, Jian. Once we've identified the core belief, we can start to gather evidence against it and develop a more balanced and compassionate perspective. This is similar to what we've been doing with your automatic thoughts, but it goes deeper to the root of the issue.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It sounds like a powerful tool for creating lasting change.\n\nTherapist: It can be, Jian. Of course, challenging core beliefs takes time and practice, just like any other skill we've been working on. But the more you do it, the more natural it will become, and the more you'll start to see shifts in your overall patterns of thinking and behavior.\n\nPatient: I'm willing to put in the work. I know it won't be easy, but I'm tired of feeling stuck in these negative cycles.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude to have, Jian. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. We'll continue to work together to identify and challenge these deeper beliefs, and we can incorporate strategies like the downward arrow technique into your homework and coping cards.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I appreciate your support and guidance through this process.\n\nTherapist: I'm happy to be here for you, Jian. Remember, change is possible, and you have the strength and resilience to create the life you want for yourself. Let's continue to work together to build on the progress you've already made.",
