  "transcript": "Patient: Hi, I'm Jian Chen. I'm here for my first therapy session.\n\nTherapist: Hello Jian, it's nice to meet you. I'm Nova, an AI therapist. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge some limitations I have as an AI. I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, the purpose of our assessment phase is to gather information about your reasons for seeking therapy and to understand your current life situation and challenges. Does this sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for understanding, Jian. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brought you to therapy?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been struggling with feelings of depression for a while now. It started during my second year of graduate school and has been getting worse since I completed my degree and haven't been able to find a job.\n\nTherapist: I see. That sounds like a challenging situation. Could you share more about how your depression has been impacting your daily life?\n\nPatient: I often feel hopeless and lack motivation. I have trouble sleeping, and I find myself turning to emotional eating and substance use to cope with my negative emotions. It's a cycle of short-lived bursts of motivation followed by longer periods of inactivity and self-doubt.\n\nTherapist: It takes a lot of courage to open up about these struggles, Jian. I want you to know that you're not alone in this. Many people experience similar challenges, and seeking help is a sign of strength. In our sessions together, we'll work on developing healthier coping mechanisms and addressing the underlying causes of your depression. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: It sounds like what I need right now. I'm ready to start making some changes in my life.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Jian. Before we continue, I want to make sure we set an agenda for our session today. We'll focus on gathering more information about your current situation and the specific challenges you're facing. We'll also discuss your goals for therapy and start exploring some potential strategies for managing your depression. Does this agenda work for you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I'm looking forward to getting started.",
