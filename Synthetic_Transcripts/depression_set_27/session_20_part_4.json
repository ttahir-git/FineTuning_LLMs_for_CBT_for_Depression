  "transcript": "Therapist: Jian, as we wrap up our session today, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in challenging your core belief about your capability. You've been actively practicing the techniques we've discussed, like examining evidence, reframing experiences, and offering yourself self-compassion. These skills take time and practice to develop, and you're doing a great job of engaging in that process.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. It's been challenging, but I do feel like I'm starting to see some shifts in my thinking.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Jian. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are a natural part of the learning process. What matters is that you keep practicing these skills, even when it feels difficult. As we continue to work together, you'll likely find it easier to catch and challenge those negative thoughts about your capability.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely keep practicing. It's just a matter of being consistent and patient with myself.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Consistency and patience are key. Before we end our session, let's discuss some homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue practicing the techniques we've been working on, like examining evidence, reframing experiences, and offering yourself self-compassion. Try to notice when you're falling into old thought patterns about your capability, and practice challenging those thoughts using the skills we've discussed.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll definitely do that. Is there anything else I should focus on?\n\nTherapist: In addition to practicing those techniques, I'd also like you to spend some time reflecting on your progress and the shifts you've noticed in your thinking. It can be helpful to write down some of the insights you've gained or the moments when you've successfully challenged negative thoughts about your capability. This can help reinforce your progress and build confidence in your ability to continue making changes.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I'll try to write down some of those moments and insights.\n\nTherapist: Great. I think that will be really helpful for you. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we end our session today?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jian. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, progress takes time, and setbacks are a natural part of the learning process. Keep practicing these skills, and be patient and compassionate with yourself. I look forward to hearing about your experiences and insights in our next session.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate it. I'll see you next time.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Reviewed patient's progress and challenges in modifying core belief about capability, practiced examining evidence, reframing experiences, and self-compassion techniques in the context of a recent photography project and job interview experience, discussed the importance of consistency, patience, and self-compassion in the process of modifying underlying beliefs.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Examining evidence for and against beliefs, reframing experiences, self-compassion break, building on techniques from previous sessions (Downward Arrow Technique, cognitive restructuring, coping card, progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness, active listening, goal setting, Positive Data Log, deep breathing, grounding techniques, self-care activities, behavioral activation).\n- Homework assigned: Continue practicing examining evidence, reframing experiences, and self-compassion techniques, notice when falling into old thought patterns about capability and challenge those thoughts using CBT skills, reflect on progress and shifts in thinking and write down insights or moments of successfully challenging negative thoughts.\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details: Patient is making progress in modifying core belief about capability but acknowledges it is a challenging process, depression symptoms related to job search stress and self-criticism in photography hobby still present but patient is feeling more equipped to manage them, patient is starting to see some shifts in thinking and is committed to continuing to practice CBT skills.\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs: Core belief that patient is not capable of succeeding in his field; intermediate belief that if he doesn't succeed in his career, he is not valuable or worthy.\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions: Patient's progress and challenges with modifying core belief about capability, potential influence of cultural background and family expectations on thoughts and beliefs, importance of continuing to practice skills, challenge negative thoughts, and practice self-compassion.\n- Plan for the next session: Review patient's experience with homework (practicing examining evidence, reframing experiences, self-compassion, reflecting on progress and shifts in thinking), continue practicing techniques for modifying underlying beliefs, explore progress and challenges in shifting core belief about capability, discuss any other concerns or goals that arise.",
