  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share some examples of the thought records I completed. One situation that triggered me was when I received another job rejection email. My initial thoughts were \"I'm never going to find a job\" and \"I'm not good enough.\" The emotions I felt were sadness (80%) and hopelessness (90%).\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Jian. Those thoughts and emotions are understandable given the situation. Were you able to generate any alternative thoughts?\n\nPatient: It was challenging, but I tried. I thought about how I've only been job searching for a few months, and that it often takes longer than that to find a position. I also reminded myself that I have unique skills and qualifications, even if they aren't the right fit for every job. After generating those alternative thoughts, my sadness decreased to around 60% and my hopelessness to 70%.\n\nTherapist: That's great progress, Jian. Generating alternative thoughts can be difficult, especially when we're feeling overwhelmed by strong emotions. The fact that you were able to come up with some balanced, realistic thoughts and experience a decrease in the intensity of your emotions is a significant accomplishment.\n\nPatient: Thanks, it's good to hear that. I guess I just worry that these alternative thoughts aren't really true, you know? Like, maybe I am not good enough, and that's why I keep getting rejected.\n\nTherapist: I understand that fear, Jian. It's common for people to question the validity of their alternative thoughts, especially when they've been struggling with negative thought patterns for a long time. That's why it's important for us to look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. Can you think of any evidence that supports the idea that you are good enough and have valuable skills?\n\nPatient: Well, I did complete my doctoral degree, which required a lot of hard work and dedication. And I've received positive feedback from professors and colleagues in the past about my abilities.\n\nTherapist: That's excellent evidence, Jian. Completing a doctoral degree is a significant achievement, and the positive feedback you've received from others is a testament to your skills and abilities. It's important to remember that the job search process is often difficult and rejection is a normal part of it. It doesn't mean that you're not good enough.\n\nPatient: You're right. It's just hard to keep that perspective sometimes, especially when I'm feeling really down.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable. It's easier to believe our negative thoughts when we're feeling low. That's why practicing generating alternative thoughts and examining the evidence is so important. With time and repetition, it will become easier to challenge those negative thoughts and find a more balanced perspective.\n\nPatient: I hope so. I'm willing to keep trying.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Jian. Your willingness to keep practicing and trying, even when it's difficult, is a real strength. Remember, progress isn't always linear. There will be ups and downs, but as long as you keep working at it, you will see improvements over time.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. That's encouraging to hear.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jian. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about building social connections, as that was another area you wanted to focus on today. Can you tell me a bit about your current social support system and any challenges you've faced in connecting with others?",
