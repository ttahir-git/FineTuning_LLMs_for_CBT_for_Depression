  "transcript": "Therapist: The pressure you feel to succeed and live up to your family's expectations is a significant burden, Jian. It's common for people to feel a sense of obligation to their families, especially when they've made sacrifices for their education and opportunities. However, it's essential to recognize that your worth is not solely defined by your career success. Let's explore this further. What do you think it would mean about you if you didn't find a job soon?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm a failure, and that I'm not living up to my potential. It would feel like I'm letting everyone down, especially my family.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, Jian. This belief that not finding a job soon would mean you're a failure is a strong one. Let's examine this thought using the same process we've been practicing. First, can you identify any cognitive distortions in this thought, such as all-or-nothing thinking or catastrophizing?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm engaging in all-or-nothing thinking. I'm seeing it as either I find a job and I'm successful, or I don't and I'm a failure. There's no in-between.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jian. All-or-nothing thinking can be very limiting and doesn't account for the complexities of real life. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that not finding a job soon means you're a failure?\n\nPatient: Well, I haven't been able to find a job in my field despite my education and qualifications. It feels like I'm not meeting the expectations set for me.\n\nTherapist: And what about evidence against this thought?\n\nPatient: I know that the job market is competitive, and it can take time to find the right opportunity. I've been taking steps to improve my skills and network, even though it's challenging.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jian. The job market can be difficult to navigate, and it's not always a reflection of your worth or abilities. Let's also consider the impact of your depression on your job search. Depression can make it harder to motivate yourself, engage in networking, and present your best self in interviews. It's not a personal failure, but rather a challenge that you're working to overcome.\n\nNow, based on the evidence, what would be a more balanced and realistic alternative thought?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"Not finding a job immediately doesn't mean I'm a failure. The job market is challenging, and I'm taking steps to improve my chances. My worth is not solely defined by my career success.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Jian. It acknowledges the challenges you're facing while also recognizing your efforts and inherent worth. How does this new perspective affect your emotions compared to the initial negative thought?\n\nPatient: When I consider the alternative thought, I feel less overwhelmed and more hopeful. It reminds me that my value doesn't come from my job title or salary.\n\nTherapist: That's a powerful realization, Jian. Separating your self-worth from your career success is an essential step in building a more balanced and resilient sense of self. Remember, your worth is inherent and not dependent on external factors like your job.\n\nAs we continue to work on challenging these negative thoughts and beliefs, I want to introduce a new technique called the Positive Data Log. This log is a way to actively collect evidence that supports your new, more balanced beliefs. Each day, I'd like you to write down at least one piece of evidence that supports your alternative thoughts and beliefs. This could be a small success, a positive interaction, or a moment of self-care. The goal is to start building a body of evidence that challenges your negative beliefs and reinforces your new, more adaptive ones. What do you think about this idea?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of actively looking for evidence to support my new beliefs. It's easy to focus on the negative, so intentionally seeking out positive evidence could be helpful.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find it helpful, Jian. The Positive Data Log can be a powerful tool in reshaping your beliefs about yourself and your life. Let's set a goal for you to record at least one piece of positive evidence each day this week. We can review your log in our next session and discuss how it's impacting your thoughts and emotions.\n\nAs we approach the end of our session today, I want to acknowledge the hard work you've been doing, Jian. Challenging long-held beliefs and facing your fears is not easy, but you've been making consistent efforts and progress. Remember, change is a gradual process, and each small step counts. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the deep breathing, grounding, and self-soothing activities we discussed. Aim to engage in at least one self-soothing activity each day, even if it's just for a few minutes. Also, continue to challenge your negative thoughts using the thought records, and start using the Positive Data Log to collect evidence for your new beliefs. Finally, try to share a little more in the veterans support group, starting with something small and manageable. Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?\n\nPatient: No, I think I understand the homework. I'll do my best to practice the techniques and use the Positive Data Log. Thank you for your support, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jian. I'm confident that with continued practice and effort, you'll make progress in challenging your negative beliefs and building a more balanced and resilient sense of self. If any questions or concerns come up during the week, feel free to bring them to our next session. I'm here to support you.",
