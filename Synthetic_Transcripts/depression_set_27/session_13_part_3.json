  "transcript": "Patient: I think I'm starting to understand how my negative thoughts are connected to my feelings and behaviors. When I feel hopeless about my job search, I tend to withdraw and avoid putting myself out there.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jian. You're recognizing the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, which is a key part of CBT. When we feel hopeless, it's natural to want to withdraw and avoid situations that feel challenging. However, this can create a cycle that reinforces the negative thoughts and feelings. Let's explore this further. Can you think of a recent situation where you noticed this pattern?\n\nPatient: Yeah, last week I was supposed to attend a networking event for people in my field, but I ended up not going. I kept thinking, \"What's the point? I won't make any meaningful connections anyway.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Jian. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle. The situation was the networking event, and your automatic thought was, \"What's the point? I won't make any meaningful connections anyway.\" How did this thought make you feel?\n\nPatient: It made me feel discouraged and anxious. I started to feel like I wasn't good enough to be there.\n\nTherapist: And what did you do in response to those feelings?\n\nPatient: I decided not to go to the event. I stayed home and played video games instead.\n\nTherapist: So, the behavior was avoiding the event and engaging in an activity that provided some temporary relief. While this is understandable, it may have reinforced the negative thoughts and feelings in the long run. Let's challenge the automatic thought using some of the skills we've been practicing. What evidence do you have against the thought, \"I won't make any meaningful connections anyway\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I don't know for sure that I wouldn't make any meaningful connections. I've had positive interactions with people in my field before, and I do have valuable skills and knowledge to offer.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the negative thought, Jian. Now, let's generate an alternative thought based on this evidence. What might be a more balanced or realistic thought about attending the networking event?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"Even if I don't make any groundbreaking connections, attending the event is still a step forward in my job search and an opportunity to practice my networking skills.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent alternative thought, Jian! This perspective acknowledges that while you may not have a major breakthrough, attending the event still has value and can help you build confidence in your networking abilities. How does this alternative thought feel compared to the initial negative thought?\n\nPatient: It feels more empowering and motivating. It reminds me that even small steps are progress and that I don't need to put so much pressure on myself to have perfect interactions.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful insight, Jian. By challenging the negative thought and generating a more balanced alternative, you're shifting your perspective in a way that can lead to more helpful feelings and behaviors. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to catch and challenge negative thoughts in the moment, which can help you break the cycle of avoidance and withdrawal.",
