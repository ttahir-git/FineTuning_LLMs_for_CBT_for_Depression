  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I think I'd also like to talk about how my cultural background and family expectations might be contributing to my negative thoughts and feelings of pressure.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Jian. Exploring the influence of your cultural background and family expectations is an important aspect of understanding your thoughts and feelings. We can definitely add that to the agenda. Let's start by reviewing the thought records you've completed since our last session. Can you share with me some of the situations that triggered negative thoughts and how you worked through them using the thought record?\n\nPatient: Well, I did manage to complete a few thought records, but I found it really challenging. One situation that stood out was when I received a rejection email from a job I had applied to. My initial thoughts were, \"I knew I wasn't good enough for this job\" and \"I'll never find a job in my field.\" I tried to look for evidence against these thoughts, like the fact that I have a doctoral degree and some relevant experience, but it was hard to believe the alternative thoughts I came up with.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing this, Jian. It's common to struggle with believing alternative thoughts, especially when the negative thoughts feel so strong. The fact that you were able to identify evidence against the negative thoughts is a great start. Let's take a closer look at one of the thought records you completed. Can you walk me through the process you used to challenge the negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: Sure. After I wrote down my initial thoughts, I tried to think of evidence against them. For the thought \"I knew I wasn't good enough for this job,\" I wrote down that I have a doctoral degree in computer science and that I've completed relevant projects during my studies. For the thought \"I'll never find a job in my field,\" I wrote down that I've only been actively job searching for a few months and that it often takes time to find the right opportunity.\n\nTherapist: That's a great start, Jian. You've identified some solid evidence against your negative thoughts. The next step is to generate alternative thoughts based on this evidence. This can be challenging, but it's an important part of the process. Let's practice generating an alternative thought for the first negative thought you mentioned, \"I knew I wasn't good enough for this job.\" Based on the evidence you've gathered, what might be a more balanced or realistic thought?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought could be, \"Even though I didn't get this job, I have valuable skills and qualifications that make me a strong candidate for other opportunities.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent alternative thought, Jian! It acknowledges the disappointment of not getting the job while also recognizing your strengths and qualifications. How does this alternative thought feel compared to the initial negative thought?\n\nPatient: It feels more hopeful, I guess. It reminds me that this one rejection doesn't define my worth or my ability to find a job in the future.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jian. By generating alternative thoughts, we're not trying to ignore or dismiss the negative thoughts entirely, but rather to find a more balanced perspective that takes into account the full range of evidence. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to challenge negative thoughts and generate alternative thoughts that feel more believable and helpful.",
