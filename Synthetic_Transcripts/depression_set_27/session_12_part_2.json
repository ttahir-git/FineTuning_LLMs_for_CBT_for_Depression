  "transcript": "Patient: The job search stress has been really tough. I've been applying to so many positions, but I haven't heard back from most of them. It's starting to feel like I'm not good enough for any job.\n\nTherapist: I can understand how discouraging that must feel, Jian. Let's explore this further. When you say \"I'm not good enough for any job,\" what thoughts and emotions come up for you?\n\nPatient: I feel hopeless and frustrated. I think that maybe I'm not cut out for the career I've chosen, and that all my years of education were a waste.\n\nTherapist: Those are heavy thoughts, and it's no wonder you're feeling so down. Let's take a step back and examine the evidence for and against these thoughts. Have there been any instances where you've received positive feedback or recognition for your skills and abilities in your field?\n\nPatient: Well, I did get good grades in my doctoral program, and my advisor always praised my research skills. And I did have that one job interview recently, so they must have seen something in my application.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're not good enough for any job. It shows that you have valuable skills and knowledge that others recognize. Now, let's look at the thought that your education was a waste. Is there any evidence against this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess my education has given me a lot of knowledge and skills that I can use in various ways, even if it's not in the exact job I envisioned. And it has opened up opportunities for me, like being able to move to the United States.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Your education has provided you with a strong foundation and has likely contributed to your personal growth as well. It's not a waste if it has helped you develop valuable skills and experiences. Now, let's generate an alternative thought based on the evidence we've discussed.\n\nPatient: Maybe I could say, \"Even though the job search is challenging, I have valuable skills and knowledge that make me a strong candidate. My education has opened up opportunities and contributed to my growth, even if my path isn't exactly what I expected.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Jian. It acknowledges the challenges you're facing while also recognizing your strengths and the value of your experiences. How does this thought feel compared to the original ones?\n\nPatient: It feels more balanced and hopeful. It reminds me that I have something to offer, even if it's taking time to find the right fit.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that alternative thought resonates with you. Remember, our thoughts have a big impact on our emotions and behaviors. By challenging those negative thoughts and generating more balanced alternatives, we can start to shift our perspective and feel more empowered.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to keep that in mind when I start getting stuck in those negative thought patterns.\n\nTherapist: Great. And we can continue practicing this skill together. Now, let's shift gears a bit and discuss your experience with the homework from our last session. How did it go with the thought records and the Positive Data Log?\n\nPatient: I did a few thought records, but I struggled to do them consistently every day. I found it hard to identify the emotions and thoughts in the moment, and sometimes I just didn't feel like doing it.\n\nTherapist: It's okay, Jian. Building a new habit takes time and practice. Let's explore what made it challenging to do the thought records consistently. What got in the way?\n\nPatient: I think part of it was that I wasn't always sure if I was identifying the right emotions or thoughts. And sometimes, I just felt so down that I didn't have the energy to sit down and write it all out.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. It can be difficult to pinpoint our emotions and thoughts, especially when we're feeling low. One strategy that might help is to set aside a specific time each day to reflect on any challenging situations or strong emotions you experienced. This can make it feel more manageable and help build the habit.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I could try doing it in the evening, after I've had some time to process the day.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. And remember, you don't have to do a thought record for every single situation. Start with the ones that feel most significant or distressing. As you practice more, it will become easier to identify the thoughts and emotions in the moment.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll try that. What about the Positive Data Log? I found that one really hard to do.\n\nTherapist: The Positive Data Log can be challenging, especially when we're feeling down on ourselves. It involves looking for evidence that supports new, more adaptive beliefs about ourselves. What made it difficult for you?\n\nPatient: I just couldn't think of any evidence that I'm capable or have valuable skills. It felt like I was reaching for things that weren't really there.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, Jian. When we're in a negative mindset, it can be hard to see our own strengths and accomplishments. One strategy is to start small and look for evidence in everyday tasks or interactions. For example, if you successfully completed a household chore or had a pleasant exchange with a neighbor, those can be examples of your capability and ability to connect with others.\n\nPatient: I guess I hadn't thought about it that way. I was looking for bigger things, like job offers or major accomplishments.\n\nTherapist: It's great to celebrate those bigger achievements, but the smaller, everyday examples are just as valid. They show that you have skills and strengths that you use all the time, even if you don't always recognize them. As you start to notice and record these smaller examples, it can help shift your overall view of yourself.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to be more aware of those little things and write them down in the Positive Data Log.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Jian. And remember, you can always bring your thought records and Positive Data Log to our sessions if you want to discuss any challenges or insights that come up.\n\nPatient: Thanks, that's helpful to know. I do want to keep working on this, even if it's hard sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Your willingness to keep trying, even when it's challenging, is a great example of your resilience and determination. Those are valuable strengths that will serve you well in your job search and other areas of your life.\n\nPatient: Thank you. I don't always feel resilient, but I'm trying to keep going.\n\nTherapist: And that's what resilience is all about\u2014keeping going, even when it's tough. You're doing a great job, Jian.\n\nPatient: Thanks for your support. It really helps to have someone to talk through all of this with.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad I can be here to support you. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. In addition to our sessions, you can also reach out to the veterans support group or trusted friends and family members when you need extra support.\n\nPatient: I'll try to do that more. I know I tend to isolate myself when I'm feeling down, but it's good to remember that there are people who care about me.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Connecting with others can be a powerful way to combat those feelings of isolation and remind yourself of your worth and value. Let's continue to work on building those social connections and challenging the negative thoughts that get in the way.",
