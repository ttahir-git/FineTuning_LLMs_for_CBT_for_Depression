  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jian, it's great to see you again for our 10th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me so far. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like deep breathing and grounding when I feel anxious in social situations. I've also been working on challenging my negative thoughts using thought records. It's been challenging at times, but I think I'm making some progress.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed and that you're noticing some progress. Challenging negative thoughts can be difficult, but with consistent practice, it becomes easier over time. How have you been feeling emotionally since our last session?\n\nPatient: I've had some ups and downs. There have been moments when I feel more hopeful and motivated, especially after using the Positive Data Log to collect evidence for new beliefs. However, there are still times when I feel overwhelmed by the pressure to find a job and succeed in my career. I sometimes doubt myself and wonder if I have what it takes.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience ups and downs throughout the therapeutic process. Recognizing and celebrating the moments of hope and motivation is essential. At the same time, it's crucial to acknowledge and work through the doubts and pressures you're experiencing. Today, I'd like to focus on exploring those doubts and pressures further and discuss how we can continue building your self-confidence. Does that sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I think I could benefit from discussing my doubts and pressures more in-depth.\n\nTherapist: Great. Before we dive into that, let's set an agenda for today's session. We can start by reviewing your experience with the Positive Data Log and discussing any progress or challenges you've faced in building social connections and sharing in the veterans support group. We can also explore any developments in your job search and how you're managing the pressure to succeed. As we discuss these topics, we'll continue practicing thought records and generating alternative thoughts. We can also introduce additional coping strategies if needed. How does that agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
