  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in challenging negative thoughts and setting goals for social connections. Remember, it's a process, and each step you take brings you closer to your goals. Before we end, let's discuss your homework for the next session.\n\nPatient: Okay, what do you have in mind?\n\nTherapist: I'd like you to continue working on thought records, focusing on situations related to job search stress and social interactions. Identify and challenge negative thoughts, and practice generating alternative thoughts based on the evidence. Additionally, set one small goal related to building social connections, like attending the photography meetup or initiating a conversation at your veterans support group. Finally, celebrate your successes, no matter how small. Recognizing your progress is an essential part of the process.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll keep practicing the thought records and set a goal for social connections. I'll try to be more mindful of celebrating my successes, too.\n\nTherapist: Excellent, Jian. Remember, if you encounter any challenges or have questions, feel free to bring them up in our next session. How are you feeling as we wrap up today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling more hopeful and motivated. It's helpful to have a plan and know that I'm making progress, even if it's not always easy.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Jian. Your motivation and willingness to engage in the process are key to your success. If any critical issues arise before our next session, please don't hesitate to reach out for support.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova.
