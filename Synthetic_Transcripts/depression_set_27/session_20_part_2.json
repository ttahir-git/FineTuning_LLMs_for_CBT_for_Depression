  "transcript": "Patient: I think I'd like to focus on my progress and challenges in shifting my core belief about capability. Even though I'm making some progress, I still find myself falling into old thought patterns sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great topic to focus on, Jian. It's common to experience setbacks and challenges when working on modifying long-held beliefs. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you found yourself falling into old thought patterns about your capability?\n\nPatient: Well, last week I was working on a photography project, trying to capture the perfect shot of a sunset. I took dozens of photos, but when I looked at them later, I felt like none of them were good enough. I started thinking that I'm just not capable of taking great photos, and that I'm not cut out for photography.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Jian. Let's explore this further. When you had those thoughts about not being capable, what emotions did you experience?\n\nPatient: I felt really discouraged and frustrated with myself. I started to feel hopeless, like I'll never be able to take the kind of photos I want to take.\n\nTherapist: I can understand how those thoughts would lead to feelings of discouragement and hopelessness. What did you do after having those thoughts and feelings?\n\nPatient: I ended up putting my camera away and giving up on the project for the day. I didn't want to keep trying if I was just going to fail.\n\nTherapist: That's a good observation, Jian. We can see here how your thoughts about not being capable led to feelings of discouragement and hopelessness, which then influenced your behavior of giving up on the project. This is a great example of how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected in the CBT triangle.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see that now. It's just hard to break out of that cycle in the moment.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it can be challenging to break out of that cycle, especially when the thoughts and feelings are intense. That's where the skills you've been practicing come in. Let's go through this example using some of the techniques we've discussed. First, let's examine the evidence for and against the thought that you're not capable of taking great photos. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the fact that I took so many photos and didn't get the perfect shot I was hoping for.\n\nTherapist: Okay, that's one piece of evidence. Now, what evidence do you have that goes against this thought?\n\nPatient: Hmm, well, I have taken some photos in the past that I've been proud of. And I've gotten some positive feedback from others on my photography before.\n\nTherapist: Great, so there is evidence that you are capable of taking good photos, even if you didn't get the perfect shot in this particular instance. Now, let's try reframing the experience. Instead of seeing it as a failure, how could you look at it in a more balanced and realistic way?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could see it as just one attempt, and that it's okay if I don't get the perfect shot every time. I can learn from the experience and keep practicing.\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Jian. Every attempt is an opportunity to learn and grow, even if it doesn't turn out exactly how you wanted. Remember, perfection is not the goal - progress is. Now, let's apply some self-compassion to this situation. What would you say to a friend who was feeling discouraged about their photography skills?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that everyone has off days, and that one challenging experience doesn't define their overall skill or potential.\n\nTherapist: That's a kind and supportive thing to say. Can you try offering that same understanding and encouragement to yourself?\n\nPatient: I can try. It's just harder to believe it when it's about me.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it can be more challenging to extend compassion to ourselves, but with practice, it will become easier. Remember, you deserve the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend. As we continue to work on modifying your core belief about capability, keep practicing these skills of examining evidence, reframing experiences, and offering yourself self-compassion. It will take time and practice, but you will gradually start to see shifts in your thoughts and beliefs.",
