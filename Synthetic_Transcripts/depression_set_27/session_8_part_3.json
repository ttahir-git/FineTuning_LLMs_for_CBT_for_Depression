  "transcript": "Therapist: Jian, let's take a closer look at the thought records you've completed since our last session. I noticed that you've been doing a great job identifying your automatic thoughts and the emotions they trigger. One thing I'd like to focus on today is helping you identify the cognitive distortions present in these thoughts.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. I've noticed that I often have negative thoughts about myself and my abilities, but I'm not always sure why I have them or how to challenge them.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Jian. Cognitive distortions are like mental filters that can skew our perception of reality, leading to negative thoughts and emotions. Some common cognitive distortions include all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, and mind reading, which we discussed earlier. Let's look at one of your thought records and see if we can identify any distortions.\n\nPatient: Alright. In this situation, I was applying for a job, and my automatic thought was, \"I'm not qualified for this position, and they'll never hire me.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jian. I can see how that thought would be discouraging. Let's break it down and look for any cognitive distortions. One distortion I notice is \"fortune telling,\" where you're predicting a negative outcome without evidence. Another might be \"disqualifying the positive,\" where you're discounting your own qualifications and abilities. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see how those distortions are present in my thought. I tend to assume the worst will happen, and I often downplay my own skills and experiences.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jian. Recognizing these distortions is an important step in challenging negative thoughts. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against this thought and see if we can come up with a more balanced perspective.\n\nPatient: Well, the evidence for the thought is that I don't have as much work experience as some other applicants might. But the evidence against it is that I do have a relevant degree and some internship experience in the field.\n\nTherapist: Great job looking at both sides of the situation, Jian. It's true that you may not have as much work experience as some other candidates, but your degree and internship experience are valuable qualifications. Let's see if we can reframe this thought in a more balanced way.\n\nPatient: How about, \"While I may not have as much work experience as some other applicants, I do have a relevant degree and internship experience that could make me a strong candidate for this position.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent reframe, Jian! It acknowledges the reality of your experience while also recognizing your strengths and qualifications. How does this new thought feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It feels more hopeful and less discouraging. I still feel a bit nervous about applying for the job, but I don't feel as defeated as I did before.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Jian. You're doing a great job using cognitive restructuring to challenge negative thoughts and shift your perspective. Remember, the goal isn't to be overly positive or dismiss genuine concerns, but rather to find a more balanced and realistic way of thinking.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. This is really helping me see my thoughts in a different light.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Jian. As we continue to practice these skills, it will become easier to catch and challenge cognitive distortions in the moment. Another technique we can use to deepen our understanding of your thoughts is the \"downward arrow\" technique. This involves asking yourself, \"If this thought were true, what would it mean about me?\" and continuing to dig deeper until you reach the core belief underlying the thought.\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. Can you give me an example of how that would work?\n\nTherapist: Sure, Jian. Let's use the thought we just discussed: \"I'm not qualified for this position, and they'll never hire me.\" If that thought were true, what do you think it would mean about you?\n\nPatient: I guess it would mean that I'm not good enough or capable enough to succeed in my career.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's keep going. If you weren't good enough or capable enough to succeed in your career, what would that mean about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm a failure and that I don't have what it takes to achieve my goals.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your willingness to explore this, Jian. It can be uncomfortable to dig into these deeper beliefs, but it's an important part of understanding and ultimately changing the thoughts that are holding you back. The belief that you're a failure or that you don't have what it takes to achieve your goals could be considered a core belief \u2013 a fundamental, deeply held belief about yourself that influences many areas of your life.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see how that belief shows up in a lot of my negative thoughts and self-doubt.\n\nTherapist: That's a powerful insight, Jian. By identifying this core belief, we can start to challenge it and replace it with a more adaptive, balanced belief. One way to do this is by looking for evidence that contradicts the core belief and keeping a \"positive data log\" of experiences that support a new, more helpful belief.\n\nPatient: What would be an example of a new, more helpful belief?\n\nTherapist: That's a great question, Jian. A more adaptive belief might be something like, \"I am capable of learning and growing, and my worth is not defined by my career success.\" This belief acknowledges that everyone has room for growth and that your value as a person is separate from your professional achievements.\n\nPatient: I like that. It feels more compassionate and less pressure than the old belief.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that resonates with you, Jian. As we continue our work together, we can keep collecting evidence to support this new belief and practice reframing negative thoughts in light of it. Remember, changing core beliefs takes time and practice, but it's a powerful way to create lasting change in your thoughts and emotions.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I'm looking forward to continuing this work and building a more positive mindset.\n\nTherapist: I'm looking forward to it as well, Jian. You're doing an excellent job engaging in this process and applying these skills to your life. Let's keep up the good work!",
