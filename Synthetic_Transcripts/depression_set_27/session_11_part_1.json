  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jian, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to keep up with the homework you assigned, but it's been challenging. I've managed to complete a few thought records and make some entries in the Positive Data Log, but I haven't been as consistent as I'd like to be. I'm still struggling with feelings of self-doubt and pressure to succeed in my job search.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Jian. It's common to face challenges when implementing new skills and techniques. Let's explore what specific obstacles you've encountered while working on the thought records and Positive Data Log. Before we do that, I'd like to get a sense of how you're feeling today. Can you share with me how your mood has been and if there have been any significant changes or events since our last session?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. I had a job interview last week that I thought went well, but I haven't heard back from them yet. The waiting and uncertainty have been stressful. I've also been feeling more isolated lately, as I haven't been as active in the veterans support group. I know I should reach out more, but it's hard to find the motivation.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you've had a mix of experiences since our last session, with some positive steps like the job interview, but also challenges like the stress of waiting and feelings of isolation. I'm here to support you through these ups and downs. Let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session, so we can make the most of our time together. Based on what you've shared, I think it could be helpful to:\n\n1. Explore the obstacles you've faced with the thought records and Positive Data Log homework\n2. Discuss the job interview experience and how you've been managing the stress of waiting\n3. Brainstorm ways to increase your engagement with the veterans support group and build social connections\n4. Introduce a new technique called behavioral activation to help with motivation and mood\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
