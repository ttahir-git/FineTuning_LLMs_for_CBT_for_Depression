  "transcript": "Patient: I think I'd like to focus on managing job search stress and building social connections. Those feel like the most pressing issues for me right now.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan, Jian. Let's start with managing job search stress. Can you tell me more about what aspects of the job search process you find most stressful?\n\nPatient: It's the constant uncertainty and rejection that really get to me. I put so much effort into each application, and then I often don't even hear back. When I do get an interview, I feel like I'm under a microscope, and the pressure is intense.\n\nTherapist: Job searching can be an incredibly stressful process, and it's common to feel overwhelmed by the uncertainty and scrutiny involved. Let's explore some strategies for managing this stress. One technique we can use is cognitive restructuring, which involves identifying and challenging the negative thoughts that contribute to your stress.\n\nPatient: I've been trying to do that with the thought records, but it's still a struggle.\n\nTherapist: I understand, Jian. It takes practice to build these skills, and it's normal to encounter challenges along the way. Let's look at a specific example from your recent job search experience. Can you think of a situation that triggered significant stress for you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, last week I had an interview for a position I really wanted. I prepared for hours, but during the interview, I felt like I stumbled over my words and didn't make a great impression.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jian. Let's break this down using a thought record. What emotions did you experience during and after the interview?\n\nPatient: I felt really anxious and self-conscious during the interview, and afterwards, I was frustrated with myself and discouraged about my chances of getting the job.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have anxiety, frustration, and discouragement as the primary emotions. Now, let's identify the automatic thoughts that went through your mind during this experience. What were you telling yourself?\n\nPatient: I was thinking, \"I'm not qualified for this job,\" \"I'm making a fool of myself,\" and \"They're going to reject me for sure.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are some powerful negative thoughts, Jian. Let's examine the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that you're not qualified for the job?\n\nPatient: Well, I stumbled over my words a few times, and I didn't have a perfect answer for every question they asked.\n\nTherapist: That's valid evidence, but let's consider the other side. What evidence do you have that you are qualified for the job?\n\nPatient: I guess I did meet all the requirements listed in the job description, and I have relevant experience from my research during my doctoral program.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. So, while you may not have performed perfectly in the interview, there is evidence that you are qualified for the position. Now, let's look at the thought, \"I'm making a fool of myself.\" What evidence do you have for and against this thought?\n\nPatient: For the thought, I felt like I wasn't articulating my answers as well as I could have. But against the thought, I didn't say anything completely off-base or inappropriate. I just wasn't as polished as I would have liked.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Jian. It's common to be our own worst critics, especially in high-pressure situations like job interviews. Now, let's generate an alternative thought based on the evidence we've examined.\n\nPatient: I could tell myself something like, \"Even if I wasn't perfect, I still managed to convey my qualifications and interest in the position. One interview doesn't define my entire worth or potential.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought, Jian. It acknowledges the imperfections in your performance while also recognizing your overall qualifications and the bigger picture. How do you feel when you consider this alternative perspective?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit less discouraged. It helps to remember that one interview doesn't determine everything, even if it feels that way in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jian. This is the power of cognitive restructuring \u2013 by examining the evidence and generating alternative thoughts, we can shift our perspective and reduce the intensity of negative emotions. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to challenge those automatic negative thoughts in the moment.",
