  "transcript": "Patient: Yes, I think challenging this core belief could make a big difference in how I feel about myself and my relationships.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that this resonates with you, Hiroshi. Challenging core beliefs can be a powerful way to create lasting change in our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. One way we can start to challenge this belief is by looking for evidence that contradicts it. You mentioned that your sister and some friends have been supportive and accepting of you. These experiences can serve as evidence against the belief that you're defective or broken. Can you think of any other experiences or examples that challenge this core belief?\n\nPatient: Well, I've had some positive experiences at my previous jobs, where my coworkers and supervisors praised my work and relied on me. That made me feel competent and valued, even if it was just in a professional setting.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Hiroshi. Those experiences at work provide more evidence against the core belief that you're defective or broken. They show that you have valuable skills and can contribute meaningfully to a team. As we continue to gather evidence like this, we can start to build a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself. Another way to challenge this core belief is through behavioral experiments. We can design small experiments that test the validity of this belief and gather more evidence to contradict it. For example, you could try sharing something personal with a trusted friend and see how they respond. This could help challenge the belief that people will reject you if they see your true self. What do you think about trying a behavioral experiment like this?\n\nPatient: It sounds scary, but I can see how it could be helpful. I have a friend who I think would be a good person to try this with. We've known each other for a long time, and he's always been supportive.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you have a friend in mind who could be a good candidate for this experiment. It's normal to feel scared or anxious about trying something like this, but that's part of the process of challenging our beliefs. We can work together to plan out the experiment and come up with some predictions about what might happen. Then, after you try it, we can discuss the outcome and how it relates to your core belief. Does this feel like something you'd be willing to try?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think I'm willing to give it a try. I know it will be uncomfortable, but I can see how it could help me challenge this belief that I'm defective.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Hiroshi. I'm really proud of you for being willing to face your fears and try something new. We can spend some time now planning out the experiment and discussing what you might say to your friend. Remember, the goal is not to prove anything, but rather to gather evidence and see what happens. Even if the outcome isn't exactly what you hoped for, we can still learn from it and use it to challenge your core belief. Let's start by identifying what you might want to share with your friend and how you can approach the conversation.",
