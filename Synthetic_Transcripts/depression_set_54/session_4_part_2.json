  "transcript": "Patient: One thought I've been struggling with is \"I'm a disappointment to my family.\" I tried to come up with alternative thoughts, like \"My sister supports me, so not everyone in my family is disappointed in me,\" but it's hard to really believe that when I feel like such a burden.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Hiroshi. I can understand how that thought might feel very powerful and difficult to challenge. Let's explore this further. What evidence do you have that supports the thought \"I'm a disappointment to my family\"?\n\nPatient: Well, my parents have always had high expectations for me, and I feel like I've let them down by not having a successful career and by being gay. They don't really understand me, and I know they worry about my future.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid point, and it's understandable how those feelings could contribute to the thought that you're a disappointment. Now, let's look at the other side. What evidence do you have that goes against this thought?\n\nPatient: Like I mentioned before, my sister is supportive of me. She tells me that she's proud of me for being true to myself and for trying to get help. And even though my parents don't always understand me, they still provide for me and let me live at home.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you're able to recognize your sister's support and the ways in which your parents are still caring for you. Those are important pieces of evidence against the thought that you're a disappointment. Based on what we've discussed, can you come up with an alternative thought that feels a bit more balanced and believable?\n\nPatient: I guess I could say something like, \"Even though I don't always meet my parents' expectations, I know that my sister supports me, and my parents still care for me in their own way. I'm trying my best to improve my situation, and that's something to be proud of.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought, Hiroshi! It acknowledges the validity of your feelings while also recognizing the evidence that contradicts the initial thought. How does that alternative thought feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It feels a bit more hopeful and less harsh. I still struggle with feeling like a disappointment, but it helps to remind myself that not everyone sees me that way.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Challenging these deeply ingrained thoughts takes practice, and it's okay if the alternative thoughts don't feel completely believable at first. The more you practice generating balanced thoughts, the more natural it will become over time.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and talk about behavioral activation. This technique involves intentionally engaging in activities that promote a sense of pleasure or accomplishment, even when you don't feel motivated to do so. The goal is to break the cycle of avoidance and withdrawal that often accompanies depression. What are your thoughts on this concept?\n\nPatient: It makes sense in theory, but it's hard to put into practice. When I'm feeling down, the last thing I want to do is go out and do something. I'd rather just stay in my room and avoid everything.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, and it's understandable to feel that way. The key is to start small and gradually build up to more challenging activities. We can work together to identify some activities that feel manageable for you and create a plan for incorporating them into your routine. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: I'm willing to give it a try. I know I can't keep living like this forever, so I need to find ways to push myself out of my comfort zone.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude to have. Let's start by brainstorming some activities that you enjoy or that give you a sense of accomplishment. These can be small things, like taking a walk outside, drawing in your sketchbook, or even just taking a shower and getting dressed for the day. What are some activities that come to mind for you?\n\nPatient: Well, I used to really enjoy studying languages, especially French. I could try to spend a little time each day practicing my French skills. And I do like drawing, so maybe I could set aside some time to work on a sketch or painting. Taking care of my hamster also makes me feel good, so I could make sure to spend some quality time with him each day.\n\nTherapist: Those are all great ideas! Studying French, drawing, and caring for your hamster are all activities that can provide a sense of accomplishment and pleasure. Let's create a plan for incorporating these activities into your routine. We can start with just one or two activities per day and gradually increase as you feel more comfortable. What do you think about starting with 10 minutes of French practice and 10 minutes of drawing tomorrow?\n\nPatient: That feels manageable. I think I can commit to that.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! Remember, the goal is not to do these activities perfectly, but rather to engage in them consistently and mindfully. Pay attention to how you feel during and after the activities, and try to notice any changes in your mood or energy levels. We can discuss your experiences with behavioral activation in our next session and adjust the plan as needed.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll give it a try and see how it goes.",
