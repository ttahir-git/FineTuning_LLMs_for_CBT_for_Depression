  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Hiroshi, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I tried the behavioral experiment we discussed and shared something personal with my friend. It went better than I expected, but I still struggle with the belief that I'm defective.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the behavioral experiment went better than expected. That's a significant step forward in challenging your core belief. Can you tell me more about the experience and how it made you feel?\n\nPatient: I felt really nervous before sharing with my friend, but afterwards, I was surprised by how supportive and understanding they were. It made me feel a bit lighter, like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. But I still can't shake the feeling that there's something fundamentally wrong with me.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to have lingering doubts, even after a successful experience like the one you had. Challenging core beliefs is a process, and it takes time and repeated experiences to start shifting them. The fact that you felt lighter after sharing with your friend is a positive sign that you're making progress. Let's explore this further. What thoughts came up for you after the experiment, and how did they relate to your core belief of being defective?\n\nPatient: After the experiment, I had thoughts like, \"Maybe I'm not as broken as I think I am\" and \"If my friend can accept me, maybe others can too.\" But then I also had thoughts like, \"This was just one experience, it doesn't change the fact that I'm fundamentally flawed.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Hiroshi. You're recognizing the presence of both adaptive and maladaptive thoughts. This is a common experience when challenging core beliefs. It's essential to acknowledge and explore both types of thoughts. Let's focus on the adaptive thoughts first. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not as broken as you think you are?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the fact that my friend was so supportive and didn't judge me is evidence that maybe I'm not as broken as I think. And there have been other times when people have been kind and accepting of me, even when I shared vulnerable parts of myself.\n\nTherapist: That's excellent evidence to support the adaptive thought. Recognizing and gathering evidence that contradicts your core belief is a crucial part of the process. Now, let's explore the maladaptive thought, \"This was just one experience, it doesn't change the fact that I'm fundamentally flawed.\" What do you think about this thought now?\n\nPatient: I know it's not entirely rational, but it's hard to let go of that belief. It's been with me for so long, and one positive experience doesn't feel like enough to counteract all the negative experiences I've had.\n\nTherapist: You're right; one experience may not be enough to completely change a long-held belief. However, it's a starting point, and it provides evidence that your core belief might not be entirely accurate. Challenging core beliefs is a gradual process, and each piece of contradictory evidence helps to weaken the belief over time. What do you think about continuing to gather evidence through more behavioral experiments and experiences?\n\nPatient: I'm open to trying more experiments and gathering more evidence. It's just hard to believe that I can really change this belief that feels so ingrained in me.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it feels challenging, but I want to assure you that change is possible. It takes time, effort, and a willingness to confront uncomfortable thoughts and feelings, but you've already demonstrated that you're capable of doing this. Let's set an agenda for today's session to continue working on challenging your core belief and developing more adaptive thoughts. What would you like to focus on today?",
