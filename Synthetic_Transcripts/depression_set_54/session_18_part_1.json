  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Hiroshi, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week. I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned, but I've been feeling really down and struggling to find the motivation to do much of anything. I feel like I'm not making the progress I should be, and it's frustrating.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it can be difficult to stay motivated, especially when you're feeling down. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have ups and downs. What you're experiencing is a normal part of the process. Let's take a closer look at what's been going on for you. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and feelings you've been having this week?\n\nPatient: I've been having a lot of negative thoughts, like \"I'm never going to get better\" and \"I'm just a burden on everyone.\" I feel like I'm letting my family down by not being able to work or contribute more. I've been spending a lot of time in my room, avoiding everyone.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Hiroshi. Those thoughts and feelings are really tough to deal with. I want to remind you that your worth is not defined by your productivity or ability to meet others' expectations. You're going through a difficult time, and it's okay to take the space you need to focus on your well-being. Let's explore these thoughts further. Do you notice any cognitive distortions in what you've shared, such as all-or-nothing thinking or overgeneralization?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess I am falling into those traps. I'm thinking in extremes, like I'll never get better, instead of recognizing that recovery is a process. And I'm overgeneralizing by assuming I'm a burden on everyone, when I know my sister has been supportive.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Hiroshi. Recognizing these distortions is an important step in challenging them. Remember the techniques we've practiced, like thought records and generating alternative thoughts. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I think I need to work on managing these negative thoughts and finding ways to cope when I'm feeling down. I also want to talk more about my relationship with my family and how it's affecting me.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan. We can start by reviewing the homework you've done and discussing any challenges you faced. Then, we can explore your relationship with your family and how it's impacting your thoughts and feelings. We'll also work on developing some coping strategies for when you're feeling low. How does that sound?",
