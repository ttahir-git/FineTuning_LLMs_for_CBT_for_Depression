  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Hiroshi, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to use the coping cards and mental coping script when I'm feeling down. It's been helpful, but I still find myself struggling with negative thoughts about my family and my self-worth. I've also been trying to do more self-care activities, like taking short walks and listening to music, but it's been challenging to stay motivated.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been using the coping cards and mental coping script. It's understandable that you're still struggling with negative thoughts about your family and self-worth. These thoughts and beliefs have been with you for a long time, and it takes practice and patience to change them. Regarding self-care activities, it's great that you're making an effort to engage in them, even if it's challenging to stay motivated. Small steps can make a big difference in managing your depression. How would you feel about setting an agenda for today's session, focusing on your progress with the coping strategies and exploring your thoughts and feelings about your family and self-worth?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'd also like to talk more about how my cultural background and family dynamics might be influencing my depression and self-worth. I think it's an important factor that we haven't explored in depth yet.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, I agree that exploring the impact of your cultural background and family dynamics on your depression and self-worth is crucial. We can definitely add that to our agenda for today. To summarize, our agenda includes:\n1. Reviewing your progress with the coping strategies (coping cards, mental coping script, and self-care activities)\n2. Exploring your thoughts and feelings about your family and self-worth\n3. Discussing the influence of your cultural background and family dynamics on your depression and self-worth\n\nDoes this agenda sound comprehensive to you, or is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers everything I wanted to discuss today. Let's start with reviewing my progress with the coping strategies.",
