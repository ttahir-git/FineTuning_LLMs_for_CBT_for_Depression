  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made an important connection there \u2013 reminding yourself of the small benefits of self-care can help boost motivation, even when it feels challenging. Let's practice this with another example. Can you think of another self-care activity you've been struggling to engage with?\n\nPatient: I've been having a hard time with journaling. I used to find it helpful to write down my thoughts and feelings, but lately, I just can't seem to make myself do it.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's explore this. What thoughts come to mind when you think about journaling?\n\nPatient: I guess I think, \"What's the point? Writing down my thoughts won't change anything. It's just a waste of time.\"\n\nTherapist: There's that all-or-nothing thinking again, along with a bit of disqualifying the positive \u2013 dismissing the potential benefits of journaling. Let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. Have there been times when journaling has been helpful for you in the past?\n\nPatient: Well, when I first started journaling, it did help me process my emotions and gain some clarity. It felt good to get my thoughts out of my head and onto paper.\n\nTherapist: That's important evidence to consider. Journaling has been beneficial for you in the past, even if it doesn't feel that way right now. Based on this, how could you modify the thought, \"Writing down my thoughts won't change anything. It's just a waste of time\"?\n\nPatient: I could tell myself, \"Even if journaling doesn't solve all my problems, it can help me process my emotions and gain clarity, like it has in the past. It's not a waste of time if it provides some relief.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent! That's a much more balanced and helpful thought. It acknowledges the potential benefits of journaling, even if they're not immediate or drastic. How do you think reminding yourself of this thought could impact your motivation to journal?\n\nPatient: I think it would help me push through the resistance and remind me that journaling is a form of self-care, even if it feels difficult in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And we can add this thought to your coping cards as well. Remember, the goal is not to force yourself to journal for hours, but to start with small, manageable steps. Even writing a few sentences can be beneficial.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can try setting a small goal for myself, like writing for just five minutes a day.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea! Starting with a small, achievable goal can help build momentum and make the task feel less daunting. And remember, you can always use your coping cards and alternative thoughts to help you get started.\n\nLet's shift gears a bit and discuss your relationship with your family. You mentioned that it's still a source of stress for you. Can you tell me more about what's been happening recently?",
