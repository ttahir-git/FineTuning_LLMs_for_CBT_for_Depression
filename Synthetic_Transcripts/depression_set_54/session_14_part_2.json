  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your homework from the last session. How did you find the process of completing thought records and gratitude journaling?\n\nPatient: The thought records were challenging at first, but I'm starting to get the hang of it. I found it helpful to write down my emotions and thoughts, and then look for evidence that supports or contradicts them. It's made me realize how often I jump to negative conclusions without considering all the facts. The gratitude journaling has been a nice way to end each day, even if some days it's harder to find things to be grateful for.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're finding the thought records helpful, even if they're challenging. It's a skill that takes practice, so don't worry if it feels difficult at times. And I'm glad that the gratitude journaling is providing some balance to your day. Let's take a look at one of your thought records from the past week. Can you share an example of a situation where you used this technique?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I had a job interview that didn't go as well as I'd hoped. Afterwards, I felt really down and kept thinking to myself, \"I'll never get a job, I'm just not good enough.\" So I decided to use a thought record to challenge that belief.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Walk me through the process you went through with the thought record.\n\nPatient: Well, I started by writing down the situation, which was the job interview. Then I identified my emotions, which were sadness and frustration, both at around an 8 out of 10 intensity. My automatic thought was \"I'll never get a job, I'm just not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: Good. And what evidence did you find for and against that thought?\n\nPatient: For evidence supporting the thought, I wrote down that I didn't get this job, and I've been rejected from several others in the past. But when I looked for evidence against the thought, I realized that I have gotten jobs in the past, even if they weren't my ideal positions. And I've received positive feedback from coworkers and supervisors before.\n\nTherapist: That's an important realization. So what was your alternative thought after considering all the evidence?\n\nPatient: My alternative thought was \"Just because I didn't get this job doesn't mean I'll never get a job. I have skills and experience that make me a good candidate, even if it doesn't always feel that way.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic perspective. How did your emotions change after coming up with that alternative thought?\n\nPatient: My sadness and frustration went down to about a 4 out of 10. I still felt disappointed, but I didn't feel as hopeless as I did before.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, and it shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing our emotions. You did a great job with that thought record. Now, let's talk about the behavioral experiment we planned to challenge your core belief of being defective. Have you had any ideas for what that experiment could look like?",
