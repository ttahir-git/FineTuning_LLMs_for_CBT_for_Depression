  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Hiroshi, it's great to see you again for session 4. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to start by acknowledging my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health and well-being.\n\nBefore we dive into today's session, I'd like to do a thorough check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the homework assignments you gave me. I had a conversation with my sister about my therapy experience, and she was really supportive. That felt good, but I'm still nervous about talking to my parents. I've also been trying to do the thought records, but it's been challenging to come up with alternative thoughts that feel believable. My mood has been up and down, but overall, I think I'm making some progress, even if it's small.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on the homework assignments and that your conversation with your sister went well. It's understandable to feel nervous about talking to your parents, and we can definitely explore that further today. I'm glad to hear that you've been trying the thought records, even if it's been challenging. Small progress is still progress, and it's important to acknowledge and celebrate those steps forward.\n\nFor today's session, I'd like to suggest a few items for our agenda. We can review your thought records and work on generating more believable alternative thoughts. We can also discuss your concerns about talking to your parents and explore some strategies for that conversation. Additionally, we can introduce a new technique called behavioral activation, which can help you engage in more pleasant activities and improve your mood. What do you think about these suggestions, and is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I definitely need help with the thought records and coming up with alternative thoughts. I'm also interested in learning about behavioral activation. I've been spending a lot of time in my room, and I know I need to find ways to be more active and engaged. As for talking to my parents, I'm still not sure if I'm ready, but I'm open to discussing it more.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start with reviewing your thought records. Can you share an example of a thought you've been struggling with and the alternative thoughts you've come up with so far?",
