  "transcript": "Patient: I think I'd like to prioritize discussing the negative thoughts that are still bothering me. Even though I've made some progress, I find myself constantly thinking that I'm not good enough and that I'll never be able to live up to my family's expectations.\n\nTherapist: That's a great choice, Hiroshi. Let's focus on those negative thoughts about not being good enough and not living up to your family's expectations. Can you tell me more about these thoughts? When do they tend to come up, and how do they make you feel?\n\nPatient: These thoughts come up pretty much all the time, but especially when I'm around my family. I feel like they're always judging me, even if they don't say it out loud. It makes me feel worthless, like I'm a disappointment to them.\n\nTherapist: I can understand how those thoughts and feelings of worthlessness can be really painful. Let's try to explore this further using a thought record. This will help us identify the specific thoughts, the emotions they trigger, and the situations in which they occur. Then, we can work on reframing those thoughts in a more balanced way. Are you comfortable with that?\n\nPatient: Yes, I'm willing to try. I remember you mentioning thought records in our previous sessions, but I don't think we've done one together yet.\n\nTherapist: You're right, we haven't done one together yet. Let's start by identifying a specific situation where these thoughts came up recently. Can you think of a time in the past week when you felt particularly strongly that you weren't good enough or that you were disappointing your family?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. Last night, I overheard my parents talking about me. They were saying that they're worried about my future and that I need to get my life together. It made me feel like they think I'm a failure.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a really difficult situation, and it's understandable that it triggered those negative thoughts and feelings. Let's use this as our example for the thought record. We'll start by writing down the situation, which was overhearing your parents talking about their concerns for your future. What emotions did you feel in that moment, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt really sad, maybe like 80 out of 100. I also felt anxious, probably around 70, and a bit angry, maybe 50.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have sadness at 80, anxiety at 70, and anger at 50. Now, let's identify the most prominent automatic thought that came up in that situation. What was going through your mind when you overheard your parents talking?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"They think I'm a failure. I'll never be able to make them proud.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a really powerful thought, and it's clear how it could lead to those strong emotions. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your parents think you're a failure and that you can't make them proud?\n\nPatient: Well, they were talking about how worried they are about my future, and they said I need to get my life together. That makes me feel like they think I'm not doing well.\n\nTherapist: I can see how you might interpret their words that way. Now, let's consider the evidence against that thought. Have there been times when your parents have expressed pride in you or supported you?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been times when they've praised me for my language skills and my creativity. And my sister is always telling me that they love me and want the best for me.\n\nTherapist: That's important to remember. It sounds like there is evidence that your parents do see your strengths and want to support you. Now, let's try to come up with an alternative thought that takes into account both the evidence for and against the original thought. What might be a more balanced way of looking at the situation?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"My parents are worried about me because they care, but that doesn't mean they think I'm a failure. They see my strengths, even if they're concerned about my future.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges your parents' concerns while also recognizing their love and support for you. How do you think this new thought would impact your emotions in that situation?\n\nPatient: I think I would still feel sad and anxious, but maybe not as intensely. Maybe more like 50 for sadness and 40 for anxiety.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in intensity. By reframing the thought in a more balanced way, you're able to reduce the intensity of those painful emotions. This is the power of thought records \u2013 they help us challenge negative thoughts and find more adaptive ways of thinking.",
