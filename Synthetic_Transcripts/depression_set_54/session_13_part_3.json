  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job identifying how your core belief of being defective is affecting your relationships, Hiroshi. Let's continue exploring this further. Can you think of any other situations where this belief has influenced your interactions with others?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been avoiding job interviews because I keep thinking, \"I'm not good enough for any job. They'll see right through me and know I'm broken.\"\n\nTherapist: That's another excellent example of how this core belief is impacting your life, Hiroshi. Let's use the same process we did with the lunch invitation to challenge this thought. First, what emotions do you feel when you think about going to a job interview, and how intense are they?\n\nPatient: I feel really anxious, like an 8 or 9 out of 10, and I feel hopeless, maybe a 7 out of 10.\n\nTherapist: Okay, now let's identify the automatic thought that comes up when you think about job interviews. You mentioned, \"I'm not good enough for any job. They'll see right through me and know I'm broken.\" Is that the main thought?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's the thought that keeps running through my mind.\n\nTherapist: Now, let's look at the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not good enough for any job and that they'll see right through you?\n\nPatient: I guess I don't have a lot of work experience, and I've been out of school for a while. I feel like I don't have much to offer.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against this thought? What makes you think that you might be good enough for a job and that they won't necessarily see you as broken?\n\nPatient: Well, I do have some skills, like my language abilities and my creativity. And I've had some positive feedback from teachers and mentors in the past about my potential.\n\nTherapist: Great job identifying evidence on both sides, Hiroshi. Now, let's come up with an alternative thought that takes both perspectives into account. What's a more balanced way of looking at this situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"Even though I don't have a lot of work experience, I do have some valuable skills and potential. It's not necessarily true that everyone will see me as broken.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent alternative thought, Hiroshi. It acknowledges your concerns about your work experience while also recognizing your strengths and the possibility that others may see you differently than you see yourself. Now, let's re-rate the intensity of your emotions, considering this new thought. How anxious and hopeless do you feel now?\n\nPatient: My anxiety is still pretty high, maybe a 6 out of 10, but my hopelessness has gone down to about a 4 out of 10.\n\nTherapist: That's progress, Hiroshi. Even though your anxiety is still relatively high, your hopelessness has decreased significantly. This shows that challenging your automatic thoughts can have an impact on your emotions. With more practice, you may find that your anxiety also decreases over time.\n\nPatient: I can see how this works, but it's still hard to believe that I can really change the way I think and feel.\n\nTherapist: Changing deeply held beliefs and thought patterns is a process, and it takes time and practice. You've already made significant progress in identifying and challenging your thoughts, and that's a huge step forward. Remember, every time you challenge a thought and come up with a more balanced alternative, you're weakening the hold that your core belief has on you.\n\nPatient: I guess you're right. It's just hard to keep doing this when I've been thinking this way for so long.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Hiroshi. It's not easy to change long-held beliefs, and it's normal to feel frustrated or discouraged at times. That's why it's so important to celebrate your successes along the way and to be patient and compassionate with yourself. Every small step you take is a step closer to feeling better and living the life you want to live.\n\nPatient: Thank you for reminding me of that. I do want to keep working on this, even if it's hard sometimes.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Hiroshi. Your determination and willingness to do this work, even when it's challenging, is a testament to your strength and resilience. Let's keep practicing these skills together, and remember that I'm here to support you every step of the way.",
