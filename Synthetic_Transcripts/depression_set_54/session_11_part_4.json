Remember, change is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel like I'm starting to see things differently and understand myself better. It's still hard, but I'm more hopeful than I was before.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Hiroshi. Your hope and willingness to keep trying are key to your progress. Before we end today, let's talk about some homework for the next week.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'm ready.\n\nTherapist: First, I'd like you to continue practicing the \"I\" statements we discussed today. Try to use them in conversations with your family and friends, and notice how they affect your interactions and your own feelings.\n\nPatient: I will. I think it will help me communicate better and feel more in control of my emotions.\n\nTherapist: Great. Second, I'd like you to research three companies that interest you and make a list of their job requirements. Remember to celebrate your success when you've completed this step!\n\nPatient: I'll do that. It feels more manageable now that I have a specific goal to focus on.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. Finally, I'd like you to continue using your gratitude journal. Write down three things you're grateful for each day, and try to include at least one thing related to your own progress or efforts.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It will help me stay focused on the positive things in my life, even when things are tough.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Gratitude can be a powerful tool for shifting your perspective and improving your overall outlook. Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?\n\nPatient: No, I think it's all pretty clear. I'm looking forward to seeing how it goes.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Hiroshi. Remember, the homework is meant to support your progress, not to be a source of stress. If you find that any of the assignments are too challenging or not helpful, we can always adjust them.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your flexibility and support.\n\nTherapist: Of course. I'm here to help you in whatever way works best for you. How are you feeling as we wrap up today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling more hopeful and empowered than I was at the beginning of the session. I know I still have a lot of work to do, but I feel like I have some new tools and strategies to help me move forward.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Hiroshi. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have setbacks along the way. The important thing is to keep trying and to be kind to yourself in the process.\n\nPatient: I'll try to remember that. Thank you for everything today, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Hiroshi. I'm proud of the work you're doing, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and I'll see you next week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Practicing difficult conversations using \"I\" statements, breaking down the job search into manageable steps, celebrating successes, and continuing gratitude practice.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Continued practice identifying and challenging negative thoughts related to family relationships and job hunting.\n  - \"I\" statements: Practiced using \"I\" statements to express thoughts and feelings in a role-play conversation with parents about sexuality.\n  - Graded task assignment: Set a small, achievable goal to research three companies and their job requirements as part of the job search process.\n  - Gratitude journal: Continued practice of writing down three things to be grateful for each day, including progress or efforts related to mental health and personal growth.\n  - Techniques from previous sessions: Behavioral activation (activity scheduling, graded task assignments), problem-solving, distress tolerance (deep breathing, grounding), cognitive distortions, reframing, cognitive conceptualization.\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue practicing \"I\" statements in conversations with family and friends, and notice how they affect interactions and emotions.\n  - Research three companies that interest you and make a list of their job requirements.
