  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you've been struggling with motivation lately. Can you tell me more about how this has been affecting your daily life?\n\nPatient: It's been hard to find the energy to do anything, even simple tasks like getting out of bed or taking a shower. I know I should be looking for a job, but the thought of going through the application process and interviews feels overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: Lack of motivation is a common symptom of depression, and it can make even the most basic tasks feel daunting. Let's explore this further using the CBT triangle, which illustrates the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Can you identify any specific thoughts that come up when you think about looking for a job?\n\nPatient: I think to myself, \"I'm not qualified for any jobs,\" or \"I'll just embarrass myself in the interview.\" It's like I'm convinced that I'll fail before I even start.\n\nTherapist: Those are some powerful negative automatic thoughts. Let's look at how they might be influencing your feelings and behaviors. When you have those thoughts, what emotions do you experience?\n\nPatient: I feel hopeless, anxious, and like I'm not good enough. It's a heavy weight on my chest.\n\nTherapist: And how do those emotions affect your behavior? What do you do when you feel that way?\n\nPatient: I usually end up staying in bed or playing video games to distract myself. It's like I'm avoiding the problem altogether.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Hiroshi. The CBT triangle helps us see how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. In this case, your negative thoughts about job hunting lead to feelings of hopelessness and anxiety, which then result in avoidance behaviors like staying in bed or playing video games.\n\nPatient: Yeah, it's a vicious cycle. I want to break out of it, but I don't know how.\n\nTherapist: One way to break the cycle is to challenge those negative automatic thoughts using the techniques we've been practicing, like thought records and cognitive restructuring. Let's try that now with one of the thoughts you mentioned: \"I'm not qualified for any jobs.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I don't have a college degree, and most of the jobs I've seen require one. I also don't have much work experience, so that's another strike against me.\n\nTherapist: And what about evidence against this thought? Are there any skills or experiences you have that could be valuable to an employer?\n\nPatient: I guess I do have my language skills. I'm fluent in English, French, and Spanish, which could be useful in some jobs. And I've done some volunteer work in the past, so that's some experience.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're not qualified for any jobs. Your language skills and volunteer experience are valuable assets that could set you apart from other candidates. Now, let's look at an alternative thought. Based on the evidence, what might be a more balanced way of looking at the situation?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"Even though I don't have a college degree, I have language skills and volunteer experience that could make me a competitive candidate for some jobs.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent alternative thought, Hiroshi. How does this new perspective affect your emotions and motivation?\n\nPatient: When I think about it that way, I feel a bit more hopeful and motivated. It's not like I'm completely unqualified \u2013 I do have some strengths that I can bring to the table.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in perspective, and it's great to hear that it's having a positive impact on your emotions and motivation. Remember, challenging negative thoughts and finding alternative perspectives is a skill that takes practice. The more you do it, the easier it becomes.\n\nPatient: I'm starting to see that. It's not easy, but it's worth the effort.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Another strategy we can use to build motivation is to set small, achievable goals for yourself. This is called graded task assignment, and it involves breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, instead of setting a goal to find a job immediately, you could set a goal to research three companies that interest you and make a list of their job requirements.\n\nPatient: That sounds more doable. I think I could handle that.\n\nTherapist: Great! Setting small goals like this can help you build momentum and feel a sense of accomplishment, which can boost your motivation over time. Remember to celebrate your successes along the way, no matter how small they may seem.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's easy to focus on the negative and forget about the small victories.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, but with practice, you can train your brain to notice and appreciate the positives. Speaking of which, how has your gratitude journal been going? Have you noticed any changes in your overall outlook since you started using it?",
