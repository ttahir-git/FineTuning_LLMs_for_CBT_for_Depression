  "transcript": "Patient: I might say something like, \"Be kind to yourself. Everyone's journey is different, and you're doing the best you can right now. Focus on your own progress and celebrate your small victories.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful way to practice self-kindness, Hiroshi. Another strategy is to focus on your own values and goals rather than comparing yourself to others. What are some things that are important to you, and how can you work towards them in your own way?\n\nPatient: I value creativity and self-expression. I used to find joy in language learning and art, but I've been struggling to engage with those interests lately.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, given your current challenges with depression. Let's explore how you can reconnect with those values and set small, achievable goals related to them. What's one small step you could take this week to engage with your creativity or language learning?\n\nPatient: I could try setting aside some time to sketch or doodle, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. And maybe I could listen to a language learning podcast during my free time.\n\nTherapist: Those are great ideas, Hiroshi! Setting small, manageable goals can help you build momentum and reconnect with your values. Remember to be kind to yourself throughout the process and celebrate your efforts, no matter how small they may seem.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I'll try to keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Hiroshi. Another strategy for managing comparisons is to practice gratitude. Focusing on the things you appreciate in your life can help shift your perspective away from comparisons. What are some things you feel grateful for, even in the midst of your current challenges?\n\nPatient: I'm grateful for my sister's support and the bond I have with my hamster. Those relationships bring me comfort and a sense of connection.\n\nTherapist: That's beautiful, Hiroshi. Nurturing those relationships and acknowledging the positive aspects of your life can help counteract the negative impact of comparisons. Let's practice a gratitude exercise now. Can you think of three more things you're grateful for and explain why they're meaningful to you?\n\nPatient: I'm grateful for having a roof over my head and food on the table, even if I'm still living with my parents. I know not everyone has that security. I'm also grateful for the progress I've made in therapy, even if it's been challenging. And I'm grateful for the small moments of joy I find in my day, like enjoying a good cup of tea or watching a funny video online.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Hiroshi. Practicing gratitude can help shift your focus away from comparisons and towards the positive aspects of your life. I encourage you to continue this practice, maybe by keeping a gratitude journal or sharing your appreciations with your sister or in our sessions.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I'll give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Great! Now, let's revisit the thought record we started earlier. We've explored the evidence for and against the thoughts \"I'm a failure\" and \"I'll never be able to achieve anything like that.\" Let's generate some alternative thoughts based on the evidence and the strategies we've discussed. What's an alternative way to view your situation that feels more balanced and compassionate?",
