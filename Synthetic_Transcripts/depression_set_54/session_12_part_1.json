  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Hiroshi, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice using \"I\" statements in conversations with my family and friends. It's been challenging, but I've noticed that it does make a difference in how I feel during the interactions. I also researched three companies and their job requirements, which felt like a small accomplishment. However, I'm still struggling with feelings of hopelessness and anxiety, especially when it comes to my family relationships and job hunting.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing using \"I\" statements and that you've noticed a difference in how you feel during interactions. It's also great that you were able to research three companies and their job requirements. Celebrating these small accomplishments is important. I understand that you're still struggling with feelings of hopelessness and anxiety, particularly when it comes to your family relationships and job hunting. Let's make sure to address these concerns during our session today. How has your gratitude practice been going?\n\nPatient: My gratitude practice has been helpful in keeping me grounded and focused on the positive aspects of my life. I've been trying to write down three things I'm grateful for each day, including progress or efforts related to my mental health and personal growth. Some days it's easier than others, but I'm committed to continuing this practice.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Hiroshi. Consistency is key when it comes to gratitude practice, and it's normal for some days to be more challenging than others. I'm glad that you're committed to continuing this practice. Now, let's set an agenda for our session today. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to discuss your experiences with using \"I\" statements, particularly in conversations with your parents about your sexuality. We can also explore any challenges or successes you've had in this area. Additionally, let's continue working on strategies for managing your depression symptoms and addressing your feelings of hopelessness and anxiety related to family relationships and job hunting. Does this sound like a good plan for our session today?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I'd also like to discuss some of the thoughts and feelings that have been coming up for me as I've been researching companies and thinking about my future career path.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely include that in our agenda for today. Your career path and the thoughts and feelings that arise as you explore this area are important to address. Let's start by discussing your experiences with using \"I\" statements in conversations with your parents about your sexuality. Can you share how that's been going and any challenges or successes you've encountered?",
