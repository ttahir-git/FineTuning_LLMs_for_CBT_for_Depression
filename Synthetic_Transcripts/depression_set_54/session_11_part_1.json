  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Hiroshi, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like using thought records and \"I\" statements. It's been challenging, but I feel like I'm making some progress. I had a conversation with my sister about my therapy, and she was really supportive. That gave me a bit of hope. However, I'm still struggling with feelings of hopelessness and anxiety, especially when it comes to discussing my sexuality with my parents and finding the motivation to look for a job.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed and that you had a supportive conversation with your sister. It's also important to acknowledge the challenges you're still facing. Let's start by exploring your feelings of hopelessness and anxiety. Can you tell me more about what's been contributing to these feelings lately?\n\nPatient: I think a big part of it is the fear of rejection from my parents. I know they love me, but I'm worried that they won't accept me fully if I open up about my sexuality. It's a conversation I've been avoiding for a long time. As for the job search, I feel overwhelmed and unsure of where to start. I'm worried that my lack of experience and my depression will hold me back.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to have those fears and concerns. Let's focus on your relationship with your parents today and explore some strategies for managing your anxiety around discussing your sexuality. We can also touch on the job search and break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. How does that sound for our agenda today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I think I need some guidance on how to approach the conversation with my parents. I want to be honest with them, but I'm scared of how they might react. As for the job search, I could use some help figuring out where to start and how to stay motivated.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's start with the conversation with your parents. One technique that can be helpful is to use \"I\" statements to express your thoughts and feelings without placing blame or making accusations. For example, instead of saying, \"You make me feel like I'm not good enough,\" you could say, \"I feel scared and vulnerable when I think about sharing this part of myself with you.\" This approach can help to keep the conversation more open and less defensive. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I see what you mean. I think using \"I\" statements could help me feel more in control of the conversation and less like I'm attacking them. It's still scary, but I can see how it might make the conversation go more smoothly.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Another strategy is to prepare for the conversation in advance. You could write down what you want to say and practice it beforehand. This can help you feel more confident and in control when the time comes. We can also role-play the conversation here, with me acting as your parents, to give you a chance to practice and get feedback. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I think practicing beforehand could help me feel more prepared. And role-playing the conversation here might give me a better sense of how it could go and what I might say in response to different reactions.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's start by having you write down some key points you want to express to your parents. Focus on your feelings and your hopes for your relationship with them. Remember to use \"I\" statements and avoid placing blame or making accusations. Take a few minutes to jot down your thoughts, and then we can role-play the conversation.",
