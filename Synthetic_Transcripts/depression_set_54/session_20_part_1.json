  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Hiroshi, it's great to see you for our 20th session today. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your support. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the CBT skills we've discussed, like using coping cards and thought records. It's been challenging at times, but I think I'm making some progress. I reached out to one of my friends, which felt good, but I still struggle with motivation for self-care activities.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the CBT skills and reached out to a friend. That's a significant step forward. Regarding the challenges with motivation for self-care, that's something we can definitely explore further today. Let's take a moment to set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my struggles with self-care and finding ways to stay motivated. I also want to discuss my relationship with my family, as it's still a source of stress for me.\n\nTherapist: Those are important topics to address. Let's add them to our agenda. We can start by exploring your challenges with self-care motivation and then move on to discussing your family relationships. I'd also like to spend some time reviewing the progress you've made throughout our sessions and discuss how you can continue supporting yourself after our therapy ends. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm also interested in discussing how my cultural background might be influencing my depression and self-worth, as we touched on that in the last session.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, let's include that in our agenda as well. So, to summarize, our plan for today's session is:\n1. Explore challenges with self-care motivation\n2. Discuss your relationship with your family\n3. Examine the influence of cultural background on depression and self-worth\n4. Review progress made in therapy and discuss post-therapy support\n\nDoes this agenda cover the main points you'd like to address today?\n\nPatient: Yes, that covers everything. Thank you, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. Let's start by discussing your challenges with self-care motivation. Can you tell me more about what specific difficulties you've been experiencing?",
