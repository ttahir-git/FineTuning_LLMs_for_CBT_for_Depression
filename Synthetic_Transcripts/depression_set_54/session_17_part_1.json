  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Hiroshi, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the thought records and gratitude practice you assigned. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I've also been thinking a lot about our discussion on comparisons and self-worth.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on the thought records and gratitude practice. It's great that you're noticing some progress, even if it's been challenging. Exploring comparisons and self-worth can be a difficult but important topic. How have you been feeling emotionally since our last session?\n\nPatient: I've had some ups and downs. There were moments when I felt a bit lighter and more hopeful, especially when I focused on gratitude. But there were also times when I felt really down and stuck in negative thoughts, particularly when I compared myself to others or thought about my family situation.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience ups and downs, and it's good that you're noticing moments of lightness and hope alongside the challenges. Gratitude can be a powerful tool in shifting our perspective. Regarding the negative thoughts and comparisons, that's something we can continue to work on together. How has your sleep been recently?\n\nPatient: My sleep has been a bit better, but it's still not great. I have nights where I struggle to fall asleep or wake up frequently. It affects my energy levels during the day.\n\nTherapist: Improving sleep is a process, and it's good to hear that there's been some improvement, even if it's not quite where you'd like it to be yet. We can discuss some strategies to further support better sleep habits. Now, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I'd like to discuss my relationship with my father and how it's been affecting me. I also want to explore more about comparisons and self-worth, as it's been on my mind a lot.\n\nTherapist: Those are important topics to focus on. I think it would be helpful to explore your relationship with your father and the emotions surrounding that. We can also continue our work on comparisons and self-worth, building on what we've discussed previously. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I think those are the main areas I want to work on today.\n\nTherapist: Great. So, our agenda for today's session will include:\n1. Exploring your relationship with your father and the emotions surrounding it\n2. Continuing our work on comparisons and self-worth\n3. Discussing strategies for improving sleep, if time allows\n\nWe'll start with your relationship with your father. Can you tell me more about how it's been affecting you recently?",
