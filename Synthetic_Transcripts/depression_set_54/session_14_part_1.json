  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Hiroshi, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to remind you that while I'm here to support you, I do have some limitations as an AI therapist. I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me, and there's a possibility that some of the information I provide may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. I also can't observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm committed to working with you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the thought records and behavioral experiments we discussed. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood. I'm still struggling with feelings of worthlessness and anxiety, especially when it comes to job interviews and social interactions.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've noticed some improvements, even if they're small. It's a good sign that you're making progress. I understand that the feelings of worthlessness and anxiety are still present, and we'll continue to work on addressing those. Let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on the behavioral experiment we planned to challenge my core belief of being defective. I've been struggling to come up with ideas for the experiment, so I could use some guidance there. I'm also interested in discussing how my family relationships and cultural factors might be influencing my depression.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan. We can definitely brainstorm ideas for the behavioral experiment together and explore how your family relationships and cultural background may be impacting your depression. Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main points I wanted to discuss today.\n\nTherapist: Alright, so our agenda for today's session will be:\n1. Brainstorm ideas for the behavioral experiment to challenge the core belief \"I'm defective.\"\n2. Explore the influence of family relationships and cultural factors on your depression.\n3. Check-in on your progress with thought records and gratitude journaling.\n\nLet's start with the behavioral experiment. Can you tell me a bit about what you've been considering so far?",
