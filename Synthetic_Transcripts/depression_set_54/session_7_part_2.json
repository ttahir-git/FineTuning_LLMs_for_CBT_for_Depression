  "transcript": "Patient: Things at home have been tense lately. My father made a comment about my lack of direction in life, and it really hurt me. I know he's worried about my future, but it feels like he doesn't understand what I'm going through.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that your father's comment would hurt you, especially given the challenges you've been facing with depression. Let's explore this further. What thoughts went through your mind when he made that comment?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"He's right, I'm a failure. I can't even hold down a job or finish my studies.\" It made me feel worthless and like I'll never be able to make him proud.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound very painful, and it's clear they had a significant impact on your emotions. Let's take a moment to examine these thoughts more closely. When you say, \"I'm a failure,\" what evidence do you have to support this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I haven't been able to keep a job, and I stopped my language studies. I feel like I'm not living up to my potential.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, and I understand how those experiences could contribute to feeling like a failure. However, I wonder if there might be another way to look at this. Have there been any instances where you've succeeded or made progress, even if they feel small?\n\nPatient: I guess I have been trying to engage in planned activities, like you suggested. And I've been practicing the deep breathing and grounding exercises, which have helped a little.\n\nTherapist: That's great! Those are clear examples of you taking steps to improve your well-being, which is a form of success. It might help to reframe your thoughts to acknowledge these efforts. Instead of saying, \"I'm a failure,\" could you consider a more balanced thought, like, \"I'm facing challenges, but I'm taking steps to work through them\"?\n\nPatient: I can try to reframe my thoughts like that. It's just hard to shake off the negative ones.\n\nTherapist: It takes practice to shift our thinking patterns, and it's normal for negative thoughts to persist. Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate negative thoughts entirely, but rather to develop a more balanced and compassionate perspective. Let's continue to work on this together.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll keep trying.\n\nTherapist: You mentioned that your father's comment made you feel like you'll never be able to make him proud. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nPatient: It's just that my siblings are all doing well in their careers and relationships, and I feel like I'm the only one who's struggling. I worry that my father will never accept me for who I am, especially because of my sexuality.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden, trying to live up to perceived expectations and seeking acceptance from your family. Let's explore this further. What do you think it would take for your father to be proud of you?\n\nPatient: I don't know. I guess if I had a successful career and a partner he approved of, maybe he'd be proud of me.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to want your father's approval, but it's also important to recognize that your worth isn't solely determined by external factors like your career or relationship status. Have you considered what makes you proud of yourself, independent of others' opinions?\n\nPatient: I haven't really thought about it that way before. I guess I'm proud of my language skills and my creativity, even if I'm not using them right now.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful! Recognizing your own strengths and sources of pride is an essential step in building self-esteem. Let's continue to explore this idea of self-pride and how it can help you cope with feelings of inadequacy or the need for external validation.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'd like to work on being more self-accepting.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. As we continue our work together, we'll focus on helping you develop a stronger sense of self-worth and acceptance. Remember, your value doesn't depend on others' approval or meeting certain expectations.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. That means a lot to me.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Hiroshi. I'm here to support you on this journey. Now, let's revisit the homework from our last session. How did you find the process of using \"I\" statements to express your thoughts and feelings about therapy to your family?",
