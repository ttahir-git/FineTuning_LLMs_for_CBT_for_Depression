  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, just the other day, I saw a post from an old high school friend on social media. He just got accepted into a prestigious university abroad, and everyone was congratulating him. I couldn't help but think that I'm so far behind compared to him and others my age.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Hiroshi. Let's break down the thoughts and feelings that came up when you saw that post. What emotions did you experience, and how intense were they?\n\nPatient: I felt really sad and hopeless, like an 8 out of 10. I also felt jealous and a bit angry, maybe a 6 out of 10.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Hiroshi. Now, let's identify the automatic thoughts that contributed to those emotions. What was going through your mind when you saw the post and felt those emotions?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I'm such a failure compared to him,\" and \"I'll never be able to achieve anything like that.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have the situation (seeing the post), the emotions (sadness, hopelessness, jealousy, and anger), and the automatic thoughts (\"I'm a failure\" and \"I'll never achieve anything like that\"). Let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're a failure?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm 23 and still living with my parents, I don't have a job, and I'm struggling with depression. It feels like I'm not doing anything with my life.\n\nTherapist: I understand how those factors can contribute to feeling like a failure. Now, let's look at the evidence against that thought. What are some things you've accomplished or positive qualities you possess that challenge the idea of being a failure?\n\nPatient: I guess I've been trying to work on my mental health, and I've made some progress in therapy. I'm also a good listener and a caring person.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Those are significant accomplishments and positive qualities. Working on your mental health is a brave and important step, and being a good listener and caring person are valuable strengths. Now, let's look at the second thought, \"I'll never be able to achieve anything like that.\" What evidence do you have for and against this thought?\n\nPatient: For the evidence supporting it, I guess I could say that I'm struggling to even find a job right now, so it's hard to imagine myself being accepted into a prestigious university. Against it, I suppose I could say that everyone's path is different, and I don't know what the future holds.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Hiroshi. Everyone's path is different, and comparing ourselves to others often leads to feelings of inadequacy. Let's try to reframe that thought. Instead of \"I'll never be able to achieve anything like that,\" could we say something like, \"My path may be different, but I have the potential to achieve my own goals and find success in my own way\"?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I like that reframing. It feels more hopeful and less judgmental.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that resonates with you, Hiroshi. Now, let's discuss some strategies for managing comparisons and building self-compassion. One technique is to practice self-kindness. When you catch yourself comparing yourself to others, try to speak to yourself as you would to a good friend. What might you say to a friend who was struggling with similar thoughts?",
