  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by discussing the homework I assigned in our last session. Can you tell me how it went with completing the thought records and engaging in planned activities?\n\nPatient: I tried to complete the thought records, but I found it challenging to identify evidence against my negative thoughts. I did engage in some planned activities, like going for a walk and drawing, but I still spent a lot of time in my room.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you made an effort to complete the thought records and engage in planned activities. Identifying evidence against negative thoughts can be difficult, especially when we're feeling depressed. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a negative thought you struggled to find evidence against?\n\nPatient: Sure. I had the thought that I'm a burden to my family because of my depression. I couldn't think of any evidence against this thought because I feel like I'm not contributing anything to the household.\n\nTherapist: That's a common negative thought among people with depression. Let's work together to find some evidence against this thought. Have there been times when you've contributed to your family or household, even in small ways?\n\nPatient: I guess I sometimes help with cooking and cleaning, and I try to be there for my sister when she needs support.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're a burden to your family. You're contributing to the household and providing emotional support to your sister. It's important to recognize these contributions, even if they feel small. Another piece of evidence could be that your family continues to support and care for you, which suggests that they don't see you as a burden.\n\nPatient: I hadn't thought about it that way. It's hard to see past the negative thoughts sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable. Challenging negative thoughts takes practice, and it's something we'll continue to work on together. Now, let's discuss the planned activities you engaged in. You mentioned going for a walk and drawing. How did those activities make you feel?\n\nPatient: I felt a little better after going for a walk and drawing. It was nice to focus on something other than my negative thoughts for a while.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Engaging in activities, even small ones, can help improve our mood and give us a sense of accomplishment. As we continue with behavioral activation, we'll work on gradually increasing the number and variety of activities you engage in.\n\nPatient: I'm willing to try, but it's hard to find the motivation sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge with depression. One strategy is to start with small, manageable activities and gradually build up to more challenging ones. We can also explore ways to make the activities more enjoyable or rewarding for you. For example, you could listen to music while going for a walk or try a new drawing technique.\n\nPatient: Those are good ideas. I'll try to incorporate them into my planned activities for next week.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're open to trying those strategies. Remember, the goal is not to feel completely better after each activity, but rather to gradually build momentum and engage in more positive experiences over time. Now, let's discuss some distress tolerance techniques that can help you manage overwhelming emotions when they arise.",
