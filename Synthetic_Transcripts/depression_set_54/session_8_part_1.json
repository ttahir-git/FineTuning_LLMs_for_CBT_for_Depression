  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Hiroshi, it's great to see you again for session 8. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please let me know if there's anything important I might be missing. With that said, how have you been since our last session? Can you share how your mood has been and if there have been any significant changes or experiences?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the problem-solving plans we discussed. I had dinner with my family on Friday, and it went better than expected. I also spent some time in the shared spaces, although it felt a bit uncomfortable at first. My mood has been slightly better, but I still struggle with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've made progress with the problem-solving plans and that dinner with your family went better than expected. It's natural for it to feel uncomfortable at first when you're making changes like spending more time in shared spaces. The fact that you're noticing a slight improvement in your mood is a positive sign. Regarding the negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, we can definitely continue working on those today. Let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize? We could discuss your experiences with the problem-solving plans in more detail, explore the negative thoughts that are still bothering you, or focus on another area of concern. What feels most important to you right now?",
