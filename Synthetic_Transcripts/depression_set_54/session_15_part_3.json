  "transcript": "Therapist: Great, Hiroshi. Let's start setting up your Positive Data Log. The first step is to identify the new, more adaptive belief you want to work on. Based on our discussion, it seems like a good belief to focus on might be something like \"I am a valuable person with strengths and abilities.\" How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. It's a belief I want to have, but it's hard to really believe it right now.\n\nTherapist: I understand, Hiroshi. That's why we're going to use the Positive Data Log to gather evidence that supports this new belief. To set up your log, you can create a table with two columns. In the first column, write down the date and a brief description of the situation or experience. In the second column, write down the evidence that supports the new belief. For example, you could write about the positive interaction you had with your friend and how it showed that you are a valuable person with strengths and abilities.\n\nPatient: Okay, I think I understand. So I'll write down situations that show evidence for the new belief I'm working on.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Hiroshi. As you go through your day, try to be mindful of any experiences or interactions that provide evidence for your new belief. It could be something as simple as completing a task you've been putting off or receiving a compliment from someone. The key is to actively look for evidence that supports the belief that you are a valuable person with strengths and abilities.\n\nPatient: I'll try to be more mindful of those moments. It's just hard to remember to write them down when they happen.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Hiroshi. One strategy is to set aside a specific time each day to review your experiences and write down any evidence you can remember. You could also carry a small notebook with you or use a notes app on your phone to jot down evidence as it happens. The more you practice, the easier it will become to notice and record these moments.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I'll try setting a reminder on my phone to review my day and write down any evidence I can remember.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Hiroshi. Remember, the goal is to accumulate evidence over time, so don't worry if you don't have something to write down every day. The important thing is to be consistent and keep practicing.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best. It's just hard to believe in myself sometimes.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, Hiroshi. Challenging long-held negative beliefs takes time and effort. That's why we're using tools like the Positive Data Log to help you build a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself. As you accumulate evidence, it will become easier to believe in your own value and strengths.\n\nPatient: I hope so. I'm willing to keep trying.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Hiroshi. Your willingness to engage in this process is a strength in itself. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. The important thing is that you keep practicing and reaching out for support when you need it.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your support and encouragement.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Hiroshi. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Now, let's shift gears a bit and discuss your relationship with your parents. You mentioned earlier that it's been a significant source of stress for you. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?",
