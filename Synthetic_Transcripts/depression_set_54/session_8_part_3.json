  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you walking me through that thought record. It's helpful to see how my thoughts are connected to my emotions and how I can challenge them.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Hiroshi. Thought records are a powerful tool in CBT, and with practice, they can help you develop a more balanced and adaptive way of thinking. I'm glad you found it helpful.\n\nPatient: I'm curious about something you mentioned earlier \u2013 cognitive distortions. Can you explain what those are and how they relate to my negative thoughts?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Cognitive distortions are common patterns of thinking that can contribute to negative emotions and behaviors. They're essentially biased or irrational ways of interpreting situations. Some common cognitive distortions include all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, and jumping to conclusions.\n\nIn your case, when you overheard your parents talking about their concerns for your future, you might have engaged in a cognitive distortion called \"mind reading.\" This is when you assume you know what others are thinking without having concrete evidence. You assumed your parents thought you were a failure, even though they didn't explicitly say that.\n\nAnother distortion that might be relevant for you is \"disqualifying the positive.\" This is when you dismiss positive experiences or qualities about yourself and focus only on the negative. For example, you might overlook the times your parents have praised your strengths because you're so focused on their concerns.\n\nDoes this make sense? Can you think of any other times when you might have engaged in cognitive distortions?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see how I might have been \"mind reading\" when I assumed my parents thought I was a failure. And I definitely tend to focus on the negative and dismiss the positive. Like, even though I know my sister supports me, I sometimes feel like she's just saying that to be nice.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Hiroshi. Recognizing these cognitive distortions is an important step in challenging them. When you find yourself engaging in \"mind reading\" or \"disqualifying the positive,\" try to pause and examine the evidence, just like we did with the thought record.\n\nAnother helpful technique is to practice \"reframing\" your thoughts. This means looking at a situation from a different, more balanced perspective. For example, instead of assuming your sister is just being nice, you could reframe that thought as, \"My sister cares about me and wants to support me, and I can trust her words.\"\n\nWhat do you think about that? Can you think of any other situations where you could practice reframing your thoughts?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of reframing. I can think of a lot of situations where that could be helpful. Like, when I'm working on my art and I start to feel like it's not good enough, I could reframe that thought as, \"I'm still learning and improving, and I can be proud of the progress I've made.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent example of reframing, Hiroshi. By focusing on your progress and the effort you're putting in, rather than judging your art as \"not good enough,\" you can maintain a more positive and motivated mindset.\n\nAs you continue to practice these techniques \u2013 thought records, identifying cognitive distortions, and reframing \u2013 you'll likely find it easier to challenge negative thoughts and maintain a more balanced perspective. It takes time and practice, but it's a skill you can develop.\n\nI also want to acknowledge the progress you've made so far, both in our sessions and in implementing the problem-solving plans we discussed. It takes courage to face these challenges and make changes, and I'm really proud of the work you're doing.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's not always easy, but I'm starting to see how these tools can help me. I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better and why I think the way I do.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Hiroshi. Developing that self-understanding is a crucial part of the therapeutic process. As we continue to work together, we'll keep exploring these patterns of thinking and how they relate to your emotions and behaviors. Remember, change is a gradual process, and every step you take is a step towards a healthier, more balanced mindset.",
