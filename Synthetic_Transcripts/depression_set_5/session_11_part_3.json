  "transcript": "Patient: I think I'm starting to see how my thoughts are influencing my emotions, but it's still hard to challenge them in the moment, especially when I'm feeling really overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alex. It's common for our thoughts to feel very powerful and convincing, especially when we're experiencing strong emotions. That's why practicing these skills regularly is so important. The more you do it, the easier it becomes to catch those negative thoughts and challenge them in the moment. Let's practice with another situation. Can you think of another time recently when you felt overwhelmed or stressed at work?\n\nPatient: Yeah, just last week I was asked to give a presentation at a team meeting. I immediately started thinking that I would mess up and everyone would think I'm incompetent.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's use that situation for another thought record. What emotions did you feel when you were asked to give the presentation?\n\nPatient: I felt really anxious, probably around 85 out of 100. And I also felt frustrated with myself, maybe around 70.\n\nTherapist: And what was the specific thought that went through your mind?\n\nPatient: The thought was \"I'm going to mess up this presentation and everyone will think I'm incompetent.\"\n\nTherapist: Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you'll mess up and be seen as incompetent?\n\nPatient: Well, I've struggled with public speaking in the past. I get really nervous and sometimes forget what I want to say. And I know that some of my colleagues are really confident speakers, so I feel like I don't measure up.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against that thought?\n\nPatient: I guess I have successfully given presentations before, even if I was nervous. And I always prepare thoroughly and know my material well. Plus, I've gotten positive feedback from colleagues on my work in the past.\n\nTherapist: Great, so there's evidence on both sides. Now, let's see if we can come up with an alternative thought that takes into account all the evidence. What might be a more balanced way of looking at this situation?\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought would be that while I may feel nervous, I have successfully given presentations before and I always prepare well. Even if I make a mistake, it doesn't mean I'm incompetent or that my colleagues will see me that way.\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges your nervousness but also recognizes your past successes and preparation. Now, if you were to believe this alternative thought, how do you think it would impact your emotions?\n\nPatient: I think I would still feel some anxiety, but probably not as intense. Maybe around 60 instead of 85. And the frustration with myself would probably be lower too, maybe around 50.\n\nTherapist: So, by challenging the initial thought and coming up with a more balanced perspective, we can see a decrease in the intensity of the emotions. This is another great example of how our thoughts can influence our feelings. As you continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to catch those negative thoughts and challenge them in the moment.\n\nPatient: I can see how this could be helpful, but it's still hard to remember to do it when I'm feeling really overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alex. It can be challenging to remember to use these skills when we're in the midst of strong emotions. One strategy that can be helpful is to set aside a specific time each day to practice the thought records. This can help you get in the habit of challenging your thoughts, even when you're not feeling particularly stressed or overwhelmed. Another strategy is to create a cue for yourself, like a sticky note on your computer or a reminder on your phone, to prompt you to check in with your thoughts and emotions throughout the day.",
