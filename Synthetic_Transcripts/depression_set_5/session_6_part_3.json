  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned that you have some supportive neighbors who have been encouraging. How do you think they could support you as you explore new career possibilities?\n\nPatient: I think just having someone to talk to about my ideas and fears would be helpful. Maybe they could give me feedback on my photography portfolio or help me brainstorm ideas for networking and building connections in the industry.\n\nTherapist: Those are great ideas, Alex. Talking to supportive people about your ideas and fears can help you gain new perspectives and feel less alone in the process. Getting feedback on your portfolio and brainstorming networking strategies are also concrete ways your neighbors could support your career exploration. What do you think might get in the way of reaching out to them for support?\n\nPatient: I think my biggest barrier is my own fear of vulnerability. I'm worried that if I open up about my struggles and dreams, I'll be judged or rejected.\n\nTherapist: That fear of vulnerability is a common barrier for many people, but it's important to remember that vulnerability is actually a strength. It takes courage to open up and share your authentic self with others. And when you do, it can lead to deeper connections and opportunities for growth and support. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I know you're right, but it's still scary. I guess I need to practice taking small risks and being vulnerable in safe relationships, like with my neighbors.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alex. Taking small risks and practicing vulnerability in safe relationships can help you build confidence and resilience over time. Maybe you could start by sharing something small about your career exploration process with one of your neighbors and see how it feels.\n\nPatient: That sounds manageable. I could start by telling my neighbor about my photography outing and see how they respond.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Alex. Starting with something small and positive, like sharing about your photography outing, can help you build momentum and confidence in reaching out for support. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. Your support system can be a valuable resource as you navigate this career exploration process.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the encouragement. I feel a little more hopeful about reaching out for support now.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Alex. Remember, small steps can lead to big changes over time. As you continue to practice reaching out for support and exploring new career possibilities, you may find that your feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness start to shift. Speaking of small steps, let's revisit the behavioral activation concept we discussed in our last session. How has it been going with engaging in meaningful activities outside of work?",
