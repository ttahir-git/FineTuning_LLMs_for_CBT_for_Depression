  "transcript": "Patient: No, I think that covers everything I wanted to discuss today. Let's start with reviewing my thought monitoring homework.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's dive in. Can you share some of the thoughts you recorded and any cognitive distortions you noticed?\n\nPatient: Well, one thought that kept coming up was \"I'll never find a fulfilling career.\" I think that's an example of fortune-telling, because I'm predicting the future without any real evidence. Another thought was \"I'm a failure because I haven't found my passion yet.\" That feels like all-or-nothing thinking, because I'm not considering the possibility that I could be successful in other areas of my life.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Alex. Those are great examples of fortune-telling and all-or-nothing thinking. It's really insightful that you're able to identify those cognitive distortions. Did you notice any patterns or themes in the thoughts you recorded?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I noticed that a lot of my negative thoughts are related to my career and my sense of self-worth. It's like I've tied my entire value as a person to my job title and salary. I also noticed that I tend to focus on the negative aspects of my life, rather than the positive ones.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important observation, Alex. It's common for people to tie their self-worth to external factors like their career, but it's not a healthy or accurate way to measure your value as a person. You are so much more than your job title or salary. In terms of focusing on the negative, that's something we call a negativity bias. It's a common cognitive distortion where we give more weight to negative experiences than positive ones. Did you face any challenges with the thought monitoring exercise?\n\nPatient: It was definitely challenging to remember to do it in the moment. Sometimes I would get caught up in my negative thoughts and forget to write them down until later. And even when I did write them down, it was hard to challenge them in the moment. I felt like I needed more guidance on how to reframe my thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alex. It takes practice to get into the habit of monitoring your thoughts, and it's not always easy to challenge them in the moment. That's where cognitive restructuring techniques come in. These are tools you can use to systematically challenge and reframe distorted thoughts. Would you like to learn more about that?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that would be really helpful. Can you give me an example of how to use cognitive restructuring?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Let's take one of the thoughts you mentioned earlier: \"I'll never find a fulfilling career.\" The first step in cognitive restructuring is to identify the evidence for and against that thought. So, what evidence do you have that supports the idea that you'll never find a fulfilling career?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been working for a few years now and I haven't found a job that feels meaningful to me. I've tried a few different industries and nothing seems to click.\n\nTherapist: Okay, that's valid evidence. Now, what about evidence against that thought? Have there been any moments, even small ones, where you felt a sense of fulfillment or purpose in your work?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been a few projects that I enjoyed working on, even if the overall job wasn't a good fit. And I do feel a sense of purpose when I'm helping others, like when I volunteer at the community center.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you'll never find a fulfilling career. It shows that there are aspects of work that do bring you a sense of purpose and enjoyment. The next step in cognitive restructuring is to come up with an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence for and against the original thought. Based on the evidence we just discussed, what could be an alternative thought?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like \"I haven't found a fulfilling career yet, but that doesn't mean I never will. There are aspects of work that I enjoy and find meaningful, and I can keep exploring until I find a path that aligns with my values and interests.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought, Alex. It acknowledges the challenges you've faced while also recognizing the potential for growth and change. How does that thought feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It feels a lot more hopeful and empowering. Like I have some control over my future, instead of just being stuck in a negative cycle.\n\nTherapist: That's the power of cognitive restructuring. It helps us shift our perspective and open up new possibilities. As we continue to practice this technique, it will become easier to challenge distorted thoughts in the moment.",
