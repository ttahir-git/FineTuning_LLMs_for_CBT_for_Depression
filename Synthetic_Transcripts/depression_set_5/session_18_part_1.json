  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for our 18th session together. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our previous session. It's wonderful to hear that you found it helpful to have everything recapped in that way. Before we dive into today's agenda, I want to take a moment to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I strive to provide the best support possible, there are some things I'm not capable of, such as accessing real-time information beyond what you share with me, interpreting non-verbal cues, or providing crisis intervention. I also want to acknowledge the possibility that I may occasionally generate inaccurate information. Please know that my goal is always to support you to the best of my abilities within these constraints. With that said, I'm excited to continue our work together today. How have you been since our last session? I'm curious to hear about any changes, challenges, or successes you've experienced.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing alright. I completed the homework assignments we discussed, including the thought records, positive data log, and the behavioral experiment of reaching out to a friend. It was challenging at times, but I did notice some improvements in my mood and ability to catch negative thought patterns. I'm still struggling with feelings of isolation and disconnection at work, though. I often feel like I don't fit in or belong there, which triggers thoughts of worthlessness and self-doubt.\n\nTherapist: I'm really glad to hear that you've been noticing some improvements in your mood and ability to catch negative thought patterns, Alex. That's a significant accomplishment and a testament to the hard work you've been putting into our sessions and homework assignments. I also hear that feelings of isolation and disconnection at work are still very present for you, and that these feelings are triggering thoughts of worthlessness and self-doubt. I want to acknowledge how painful and challenging that experience must be. Perhaps we could spend some time today exploring those feelings and thoughts in more depth, and work on developing some strategies to help you cope with them. What do you think about including that on our agenda for today's session?",
