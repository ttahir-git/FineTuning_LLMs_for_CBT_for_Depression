  "transcript": "Therapist: It's understandable how receiving critical feedback can trigger thoughts of not being good enough, and how comparing yourself to others can lead to feelings of falling behind. Let's examine these thoughts more closely using a thought record. We'll start with the situation of receiving critical feedback at work. Can you identify the emotions that come up for you in that moment and rate their intensity on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: When I receive critical feedback, I feel a mix of emotions. I feel disappointed in myself, frustrated, and sometimes even angry. I'd say the disappointment is around an 80, frustration around 75, and anger around 60.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for identifying those emotions and their intensities, Alex. Now, let's identify the automatic thoughts that go through your mind when you receive critical feedback. What thoughts tend to pop up in that moment?\n\nPatient: I usually think things like, \"I'm not good enough,\" \"I'll never be successful,\" and \"I'm a failure.\" These thoughts feel very real and overwhelming in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Those are powerful thoughts, Alex. I appreciate you sharing them with me. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. Can you think of any evidence that supports the idea that you're not good enough or that you're a failure?\n\nPatient: Well, the critical feedback itself feels like evidence. If I were good enough, I wouldn't be receiving criticism, right? And the fact that I'm not happy or fulfilled in my career makes me feel like I'm failing.\n\nTherapist: I can see how the critical feedback and your current career dissatisfaction might feel like evidence supporting those thoughts. Now, let's consider evidence against these thoughts. Can you think of any times when you've received positive feedback or recognition for your work?\n\nPatient: I suppose there have been times when I've received praise for my contributions to projects or my attention to detail. And I've received good performance reviews in the past. It's just hard to remember those moments when I'm feeling down on myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alex. It's common for us to focus on the negative and overlook the positive, especially when we're feeling down. Recognizing and reminding ourselves of the positive moments is an important part of challenging negative thoughts. Let's look at the evidence you've shared and see if we can come up with an alternative thought that feels more balanced.\n\nPatient: I guess an alternative thought could be that while I have room for improvement, I've also had successes and positive feedback in my career. And just because I'm not fulfilled in my current job doesn't mean I'm a failure or that I won't find fulfillment in the future.\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Alex. It acknowledges the areas for growth while also recognizing your past successes and the potential for future fulfillment. How do you feel when you consider this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: When I think about it that way, I feel a bit lighter. The disappointment and frustration feel less intense, maybe around a 60 now instead of the 80 and 75 I mentioned earlier.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Alex. This is a great example of how examining our thoughts and considering alternative perspectives can help shift our emotions. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to catch those negative automatic thoughts and challenge them in the moment.",
