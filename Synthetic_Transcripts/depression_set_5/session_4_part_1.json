  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 4. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the thought monitoring and identify cognitive distortions. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some patterns in my thinking. I also reached out to a friend and we had a nice phone conversation, which felt good. However, I'm still struggling with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, especially when it comes to my career.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the thought monitoring and reaching out to friends. It's a great step forward, even if it feels challenging at times. I understand that feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness can be overwhelming, particularly when it comes to your career. Let's make sure to address that in today's session. Before we set our agenda, can you share a bit more about how those feelings have been impacting you lately?\n\nPatient: The feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness have been making it hard for me to focus on anything else. I keep thinking that I'll never find a fulfilling career or be able to support myself financially. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of negative thoughts, and I can't seem to break free. I know we talked about setting small goals, but it feels like even those are out of reach.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alex. It takes courage to open up about these struggles. The cycle of negative thoughts you described is something we can work on together. Today, I'd like to introduce some cognitive restructuring techniques to help challenge those distorted thoughts. We can also explore behavioral activation strategies related to your career goals, like breaking them down into even smaller, more manageable steps. What do you think about including those topics in our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I think I could really benefit from learning how to challenge those negative thoughts. And I like the idea of breaking down my career goals even further. It might make them feel more achievable.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's add cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation for your career goals to our agenda. We can also review your thought monitoring homework and discuss any insights or challenges you've had with that. Is there anything else you'd like to prioritize for today's session?\n\nPatient: I think that covers the main things I wanted to discuss. I'm also curious about how to handle situations where I feel overwhelmed by my emotions. We touched on distress tolerance techniques before, but I'm not sure if I fully understand how to use them in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alex. Distress tolerance techniques can be really helpful when you're feeling overwhelmed. We can definitely include a review of those techniques in our agenda, and I'll make sure to provide some examples of how to use them in the moment. So, to summarize, our agenda for today includes:\n\n1. Reviewing your thought monitoring homework and discussing insights or challenges\n2. Introducing cognitive restructuring techniques to challenge distorted thoughts\n3. Exploring behavioral activation strategies for your career goals\n4. Reviewing distress tolerance techniques for managing overwhelming emotions\n\nDoes that sound good to you? Is there anything you'd like to add or change?",
