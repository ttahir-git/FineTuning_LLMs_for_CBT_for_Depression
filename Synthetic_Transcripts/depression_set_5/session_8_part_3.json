  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job identifying the emotions and thoughts that come up for you when you receive critical feedback at work. Let's continue to explore this further. You mentioned that when you receive critical feedback, you think \"I'm not good enough,\" \"I'll never be successful,\" and \"I'm a failure.\" These thoughts seem to be quite extreme and absolute. Can you think of any cognitive distortions that might be at play here?\n\nPatient: I'm not sure. What do you mean by cognitive distortions?\n\nTherapist: Cognitive distortions are common patterns of thinking that can contribute to negative emotions and behaviors. They often involve biased or irrational ways of interpreting situations. Some examples include all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, and jumping to conclusions. In this case, it seems like you might be engaging in all-or-nothing thinking, where you see things in extreme, black-and-white terms. When you receive critical feedback, you jump to the conclusion that you're not good enough or a failure, rather than considering the possibility that there are areas for improvement alongside your strengths.\n\nPatient: I can see that. It's hard for me to find a middle ground when I'm feeling down on myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alex. Recognizing these cognitive distortions is an important step in challenging negative thoughts. Another distortion that might be at play here is overgeneralization, where you take one instance of critical feedback and generalize it to your entire sense of self-worth and future potential. Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that's true. I tend to take one negative experience and blow it out of proportion, forgetting about all the positive things I've accomplished.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Overgeneralization can make it difficult to see the bigger picture and maintain a balanced perspective. As we continue to practice identifying and challenging these cognitive distortions, it will become easier to catch them in the moment and reframe your thoughts in a more helpful way.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's just hard to do in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts and emotions.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Alex. It takes practice to be able to catch and challenge these thoughts in the moment. That's why we start by practicing in sessions and through homework exercises, so that it becomes more automatic over time. Remember, you don't have to be perfect at this. Even small shifts in thinking can make a big difference in how you feel.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just frustrating sometimes, feeling like I'm not making progress fast enough.\n\nTherapist: I understand that frustration, Alex. It's common to want to see immediate results, but therapy is a process, and progress often happens gradually. It's important to celebrate the small victories along the way, like the insights you've had today about cognitive distortions and the alternative thoughts you've generated. These are significant steps forward, even if it doesn't always feel that way in the moment.\n\nPatient: You're right. I need to remember to give myself credit for the progress I am making, even if it feels small.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Celebrating small victories is an important part of maintaining motivation and building self-compassion. Speaking of self-compassion, let's explore how that might play a role in managing the negative thoughts and emotions that come up for you around work and self-worth.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'm open to that. What do you mean by self-compassion?",
