  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 8. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever feel you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Lastly, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like body language or tone of voice. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like behavioral activation and thought records. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood. I went on a photography walk over the weekend, which felt good, but I still struggle with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, especially when it comes to my career.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed and that you're noticing some improvements in your mood. It's great that you were able to engage in a meaningful activity like photography. Regarding your struggles with worthlessness and hopelessness related to your career, let's explore that further today. How would you feel about setting an agenda for our session? What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my career concerns and the feelings of worthlessness that come with it. It's been weighing heavily on my mind lately. Maybe we could also discuss how I can continue practicing vulnerability and reaching out for support, as I've been finding that challenging.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan. Let's start by discussing your career concerns and the associated feelings of worthlessness. We can then explore how practicing vulnerability and reaching out for support might help you navigate these challenges. As we work through these topics, we'll continue to use the CBT triangle to understand the connections between your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Does this agenda sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I'm ready to dive in.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's start by exploring your career concerns. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and feelings that have been coming up for you recently?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been feeling stuck and unfulfilled in my current job. I don't find the work meaningful, and I often feel like I'm not making a difference. It's hard to motivate myself to go to work every day, and I feel like I'm not living up to my potential. These thoughts make me feel hopeless and worthless, like I'll never find a career that truly satisfies me.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alex. I can understand how feeling stuck and unfulfilled in your career can lead to feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. Let's examine these thoughts further using the CBT triangle. Can you identify any specific situations or triggers that lead to these thoughts and feelings?\n\nPatient: One trigger is when I receive critical feedback at work. Even if it's constructive, I tend to internalize it and feel like I'm not good enough. Another trigger is when I see my friends and colleagues succeeding in their careers and feeling passionate about their work. It makes me feel like I'm falling behind and not living up to my potential.\n\nTherapist: Those are great insights, Alex. Let's focus on the situation where you receive critical feedback at work. Can you walk me through the thoughts that go through your mind in that moment?",
