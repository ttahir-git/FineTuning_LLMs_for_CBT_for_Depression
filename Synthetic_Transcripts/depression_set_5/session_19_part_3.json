  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job identifying how your thoughts and feelings about work are interconnected, Alex. I want to explore this a bit further. When you're feeling overwhelmed and having thoughts like \"I'm not doing enough,\" how does that impact your behavior at work?\n\nPatient: When I'm in that headspace, I tend to either shut down and avoid my tasks, or I go into overdrive and try to do everything at once. Neither of those is really productive, but it's like I can't find a middle ground.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Alex. This is a great example of how our thoughts and feelings can drive our behaviors, even when those behaviors aren't necessarily helpful. When we get stuck in patterns like avoidance or overworking, it can actually reinforce the negative thoughts and feelings, creating a vicious cycle. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see that. It's like I'm either proving to myself that I can't handle the work by avoiding it, or I'm burning myself out by trying to do too much.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And that's where some of the skills we've been working on can be really helpful. By challenging those negative thoughts and finding more balanced perspectives, we can start to break out of those unhelpful behavior patterns. One technique that can be particularly useful for this is behavioral activation. Have you heard of that before?\n\nPatient: I think so, but I'm not totally sure what it means.\n\nTherapist: Behavioral activation is essentially about intentionally engaging in activities that are meaningful or enjoyable, even when we don't feel motivated to do them. The idea is that by changing our behaviors, we can start to shift our thoughts and feelings as well. For example, if you notice yourself starting to avoid a work task because you're feeling overwhelmed, you could try setting a small, achievable goal related to that task and rewarding yourself when you complete it. Over time, this can help build momentum and break the cycle of avoidance. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: It makes sense in theory, but it's hard to imagine actually doing it when I'm in that mindset.\n\nTherapist: That's a totally valid concern, Alex. And that's why we practice these skills in smaller, more manageable ways first. It's not about trying to force yourself to do everything perfectly all at once. It's about taking small steps and building up your confidence over time. What's one small work-related task you could practice this with over the next week?\n\nPatient: I guess I could try setting a goal to respond to all my emails within 24 hours, instead of letting them pile up until I feel overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Alex! It's specific, achievable, and directly related to breaking that pattern of avoidance. And remember, the goal isn't to be perfect at it right away. It's about practicing a different way of approaching your work, even if it's uncomfortable at first. What could you do to reward yourself when you meet that goal?\n\nPatient: Maybe I could take a short walk outside or treat myself to a favorite snack.\n\nTherapist: Those are both great ideas! Building in those small rewards can help reinforce the positive behavior and make it easier to keep going. And over time, as you practice this more, you may start to notice shifts in those negative thoughts and feelings about work as well. What do you think about giving that a try this week?\n\nPatient: I'm willing to give it a shot. It's just hard to break out of those old patterns.\n\nTherapist: I completely understand that, Alex. And I want to acknowledge the courage and effort it takes to try something new, even when it's hard. Remember, you don't have to do this perfectly. It's about taking small steps and being kind to yourself in the process. And we'll keep working on this together. You've already made some really important insights today, and that's something to be proud of.",
