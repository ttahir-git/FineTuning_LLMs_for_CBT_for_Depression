  "transcript": "Patient: Those are good ideas. I'll try setting aside time each day to practice the thought records and create some reminders for myself.\n\nTherapist: Great, I'm glad you find those strategies helpful. As you continue to practice challenging your thoughts, you'll likely find it easier to do so in the moment when you're feeling overwhelmed. Remember, it's a skill that takes time and repetition to build, so be patient with yourself.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best. It's just hard sometimes when the negative thoughts feel so strong and convincing.\n\nTherapist: I understand. That's why it's so important to practice challenging those thoughts consistently, even when you're not feeling particularly stressed or overwhelmed. The more you do it, the more automatic it will become, and the less power those negative thoughts will have over you.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just need to keep at it.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And remember, you don't have to do this alone. I'm here to support you and help you work through these challenges. In addition to practicing the thought records, it can also be helpful to engage in activities that boost your mood and give you a sense of accomplishment or enjoyment. We've talked before about your interest in photography and volunteering. How have you been doing with incorporating those activities into your routine?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to make more time for photography, and I did go on a photo walk last weekend, which was nice. But I haven't made much progress with the volunteering yet. I keep putting it off because I feel like I don't have the time or energy.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you've been making some time for photography. That's a great step. As for the volunteering, it's understandable that it feels challenging to fit it into your schedule, especially when you're already feeling drained from work. Let's see if we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. What would be the first step you could take towards getting involved in volunteering?\n\nPatient: I guess the first step would be to research some local organizations that need volunteers and see what opportunities are available.\n\nTherapist: That's a great first step. And how much time do you think you would need to set aside to do that research?\n\nPatient: Probably just an hour or two. I could do it on a weekend or in the evening after work.\n\nTherapist: That sounds very doable. And once you've done that research, what would be the next step?\n\nPatient: I suppose the next step would be to reach out to one or two organizations that interest me and see what their process is for getting involved.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. And how much time do you think that would take?\n\nPatient: Probably just 30 minutes or so to send some emails or make some phone calls.\n\nTherapist: So, if you break it down like that, it seems much more manageable, doesn't it? You could set aside an hour or two this weekend to do the research, and then maybe 30 minutes next week to reach out to a couple of organizations. How does that feel?\n\nPatient: It feels more doable when I think about it that way. I guess I was getting overwhelmed thinking about the whole process, but breaking it down into smaller steps makes it seem more achievable.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alex. Breaking things down into smaller, more manageable steps is a great way to approach tasks that feel overwhelming. And as you start to make progress with the volunteering, you may find that it gives you a sense of purpose and fulfillment that helps counteract some of the stress and negativity you experience at work.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that's what I'm hoping for. I just need to push myself to take those first steps.\n\nTherapist: And remember, you don't have to do it all at once. Start with the research this weekend, and then we can check in on your progress next session and talk about the next steps. I'm confident that you can do this, Alex. You've already made great progress in challenging your negative thoughts and making time for meaningful activities like photography. This is just another step in that journey.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your encouragement and support. I'll do my best to make some progress with the volunteering before our next session.\n\nTherapist: I have no doubt that you will, Alex. And remember, even small steps are progress. Be kind to yourself and celebrate each step forward, no matter how small it may seem.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: Great. Before we wrap up, let's do a quick check-in on your mood. How are you feeling now, compared to the beginning of our session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better, actually. Still some anxiety and sadness, but not as intense as before. Maybe around 50 for anxiety and 40 for sadness.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Alex. It's great that you're able to notice a shift in your emotions after practicing these skills. That's a sign that you're making progress and building resilience.\n\nPatient: Yeah, it's encouraging to see that it's making a difference.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And as you continue to practice, you'll likely find that it becomes easier and more automatic to challenge those negative thoughts and feelings. For homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the thought records, setting aside some dedicated time each day. I'd also like you to do the research on volunteering opportunities this weekend, and if you feel up to it, reach out to one or two organizations next week. We can check in on your progress next session and troubleshoot any challenges that come up.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. I'll do my best to follow through on that.\n\nTherapist: I know you will, Alex. And remember, progress isn't always linear. There will be ups and downs, but what matters is that you keep moving forward, one step at a time. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate that.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome. Let's plan to meet again next week at our usual time. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you need any support or have any questions. Take care, Alex.\n\nPatient: Thanks, you too.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Managing work stress and challenging negative thoughts related to professional competence and value\n  - Strategies for practicing thought records and self-compassion skills consistently\n  - Breaking down the process of getting involved in volunteering into smaller, manageable steps\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Continued practicing identifying emotions, automatic thoughts, evidence for/against, and generating alternative thoughts.
