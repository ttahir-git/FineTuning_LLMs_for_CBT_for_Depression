  "transcript": "Therapist: For your homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the skills we've discussed. First, engage in at least one meaningful activity using the graded task assignment approach. This could be another photography walk or any other hobby that brings you joy. Second, use thought records to examine any distressing thoughts that come up, especially those related to work or self-worth. Third, practice the distress tolerance techniques we've covered when you're feeling overwhelmed. Finally, I'd like you to reach out to your neighbor or another supportive person and share something you've been struggling with. This will help you practice vulnerability and build your support system.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I'll do my best to complete the homework assignments.\n\nTherapist: Remember, the homework is meant to help you practice and reinforce the skills we've discussed. It's okay if you don't complete everything perfectly. The important thing is to make an effort and observe your experiences. We can always troubleshoot any challenges that come up in our next session.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: Before we wrap up, I want to check in on how you're feeling now. Has anything shifted for you during our session today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit lighter and more hopeful. It's helpful to have a plan and some tools to work with. I know it won't be easy, but I feel more equipped to handle the challenges.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, progress is often gradual, and every small step counts. I'm here to support you along the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your guidance and support.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alex. Let's plan to meet again next week at the same time. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences with the homework next week.\n\nPatient: Sounds good. I'll see you next week. Take care.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed the patient's experience with behavioral activation and engaging in meaningful activities.\n  - Explored the patient's thoughts and emotions related to receiving critical feedback at work using the CBT triangle and thought records.\n  - Introduced problem-solving skills and discussed their application to work-related stress and overwhelming emotions.\n  - Continued discussing vulnerability and ways to reach out for support.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Distress tolerance techniques: Encouraged continued practice of deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and grounding exercises for managing overwhelming emotions.\n  - Behavioral activation: Reviewed the patient's experience with engaging in meaningful activities and celebrated successes.
