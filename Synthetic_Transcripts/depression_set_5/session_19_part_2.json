  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's dive into exploring your thoughts and feelings related to work stress. Can you tell me more about the pressure you're experiencing and how it's affecting you?\n\nPatient: Well, there's this constant expectation to perform at a high level, to meet tight deadlines, and to always be available. Even when I'm not at work, I feel like I can't fully disconnect. It's like I'm always on edge, waiting for the next urgent request or fire to put out. It's exhausting.\n\nTherapist: That sounds incredibly draining, Alex. It's no wonder you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed. Let's try to break this down a bit. What are some of the specific thoughts that run through your mind when you're feeling this pressure?\n\nPatient: I guess I have thoughts like, \"I'm not doing enough,\" \"I should be able to handle this,\" \"If I don't meet this deadline, I'm going to let everyone down,\" \"I'm going to get fired if I can't keep up.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are some really powerful thoughts, and I can see how they contribute to your stress. Let's look at them a bit more closely. When you have the thought, \"I'm not doing enough,\" what emotions come up for you?\n\nPatient: I feel inadequate, like I'm failing. It's a mix of guilt, shame, and anxiety.\n\nTherapist: That's a heavy emotional burden to carry. And it sounds like these thoughts and feelings are fueling each other, creating a vicious cycle. The thought \"I'm not doing enough\" leads to feelings of inadequacy, which then likely makes it harder to focus and be productive, which in turn reinforces the thought that you're not doing enough. Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, that's exactly it. It feels like a never-ending cycle that I can't break out of.\n\nTherapist: I want you to know that this is a very common pattern, and it's something we can work on changing. One way we can start to break this cycle is by examining these thoughts more closely and looking for evidence that supports or refutes them. This is where the thought records you've been practicing can be really helpful. Let's take the thought \"I'm not doing enough\" and look at it through that lens. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, there are times when I miss deadlines or don't get as much done as I'd like. And I see my colleagues seeming to handle everything without a problem, so I feel like I should be able to do the same.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so there are some concrete examples that you feel support this thought. Now let's look for evidence that might not support it. What are some ways in which you are doing enough or meeting expectations?\n\nPatient: I guess there are times when I do meet deadlines and get positive feedback on my work. And my boss hasn't said anything about my performance being an issue. It's just hard to focus on those things when I'm feeling so overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alex. When we're feeling stressed and anxious, it's easy to discount or overlook evidence that doesn't fit with our negative thoughts. But those pieces of evidence are just as important, if not more so. Let's look at this from another angle. What would you say to a friend or colleague who expressed feeling like they weren't doing enough, despite evidence that they were meeting expectations?\n\nPatient: I would probably remind them of their accomplishments and the positive feedback they've received. I'd tell them that everyone struggles sometimes and that it doesn't mean they're not capable or valuable.\n\nTherapist: That's a really compassionate and balanced perspective, Alex. And I would argue that the same applies to you. Just because you have moments of struggle or imperfection doesn't negate all the ways in which you are succeeding and contributing. Does this make sense?\n\nPatient: It does make sense logically. It's just hard to really believe it and feel it, you know?\n\nTherapist: I completely understand that. Changing our thoughts and beliefs is a process, and it takes time and practice. That's why we've been working on building these skills, like the thought records and positive data log. It's about slowly chipping away at these negative thoughts and building up more balanced and compassionate ones. Let's keep working on this together. What do you say?\n\nPatient: Okay, I'm willing to keep trying. It's just frustrating sometimes when it feels like I'm not making progress.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, and I want to acknowledge the effort and courage it takes to keep showing up for this work, even when it's hard. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and every small step counts. You've already made some important shifts in how you're thinking about your work stress, and that's something to be proud of. What's one small action you can take this week to practice challenging these negative thoughts about work?\n\nPatient: I guess I could try to consciously look for evidence that I am doing enough, like positive feedback or meeting deadlines, and write it down in my positive data log.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Alex! Taking the time to actively look for and record that evidence can help counteract the negativity bias and make it easier to access those more balanced thoughts when you're feeling stressed. I'm excited to hear how it goes.",
