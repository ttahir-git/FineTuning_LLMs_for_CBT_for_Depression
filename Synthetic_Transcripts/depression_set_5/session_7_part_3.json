  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job using the thought record to examine your thoughts about engaging in hobbies. Let's continue to explore how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are connected. Can you think of a recent situation at work that triggered strong emotions for you?\n\nPatient: Yes, just last week I received some critical feedback from my supervisor on a project I had been working on. It made me feel really discouraged and hopeless about my career.\n\nTherapist: I can understand how receiving critical feedback can be discouraging. Let's break down that experience using the CBT triangle. First, can you identify the emotions you felt in that moment and rate their intensity on a scale of 0-10?\n\nPatient: I felt really sad, probably an 8, and also anxious, maybe a 7. I also felt a bit angry at myself, around a 6.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write those down in the \"Emotions\" column. Now, what thoughts went through your mind when you received the feedback?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I'm never going to be good enough at this job\" and \"I'm a failure in my career.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are important to explore. Let's write them down in the \"Automatic Thoughts\" column. Now, how did those thoughts and emotions influence your behavior after receiving the feedback?\n\nPatient: I just wanted to avoid my supervisor and the project altogether. I ended up procrastinating on making the changes they suggested and felt even worse about myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. We can see how your thoughts and emotions led to avoidance behaviors, which then reinforced your negative thoughts and feelings. This is the vicious cycle that CBT aims to break. By examining and reframing your thoughts, we can help shift your emotions and behaviors in a more positive direction.\n\nPatient: I can see how that cycle plays out in my life. It's just hard to break out of it sometimes.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it can be challenging to break out of these patterns. That's why we practice skills like thought records and behavioral activation. With time and practice, it becomes easier to catch these cycles and intervene. Let's use the thought record to examine the thoughts you had after receiving the feedback. What evidence do you have that supports the thought \"I'm never going to be good enough at this job\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been struggling with this project for a while, and the feedback I received was pretty critical. It made me feel like I'm not meeting expectations.\n\nTherapist: That's valid evidence. Let's write that down in the \"Evidence For\" column. Now, what evidence do you have that contradicts this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess I have received positive feedback on other projects in the past. And I know that everyone makes mistakes and has room for improvement.\n\nTherapist: Great points. Let's add those to the \"Evidence Against\" column. Now, based on the evidence you've gathered, can you come up with an alternative thought that reframes the original automatic thought?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"Receiving critical feedback is an opportunity for growth, and it doesn't mean I'm not good enough. I've had successes in the past and can learn from this experience.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent alternative thought. It acknowledges the feedback while also recognizing your past successes and the opportunity for growth. Let's write that down in the \"Alternative Thought\" column. Now, I'd like you to re-rate the intensity of the emotions you felt after receiving the feedback, considering this new perspective.\n\nPatient: The sadness has gone down from an 8 to a 5, and the anxiety from a 7 to a 4. The anger at myself has also decreased from a 6 to a 3.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in intensity across all emotions. This shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing our feelings and behaviors. By continuing to practice these skills, you can start to break the cycle of negative thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.\n\nPatient: It's helpful to see it laid out like this. I know it will take practice, but I feel more hopeful about managing these situations in the future.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad this has been helpful for you. Remember, change takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself as you continue to work on these skills. Speaking of practice, let's discuss some homework assignments for the coming week.",
