  "transcript": "Patient: My work stress has been really overwhelming lately. I feel like I'm constantly behind on deadlines, and my boss has been giving me a lot of negative feedback. It's making me question whether I'm cut out for this job at all. I know we've been working on challenging negative thoughts, but it's hard to see things differently when I'm facing so much criticism.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like work has been a significant source of stress for you lately, and it's understandable that the negative feedback from your boss is impacting your self-esteem and making it harder to challenge negative thoughts. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a situation at work that triggered negative thoughts and emotions?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just last week, I was working on a project that I thought I had done well on, but when I submitted it to my boss, she told me it wasn't up to the company's standards and that I needed to revise it. I felt really discouraged and started thinking, \"I'm not good enough for this job. I'll never be able to meet their expectations.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. I can see how that situation would trigger negative thoughts and emotions. Let's break this down using a thought record. First, can you identify the emotions you felt in that moment and rate their intensity on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt really disappointed and frustrated, maybe around 80 out of 100. I also felt anxious about my job security, around 75 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so disappointment at 80 and anxiety at 75. Now, let's identify the automatic thought that came up in that situation. You mentioned thinking, \"I'm not good enough for this job. I'll never be able to meet their expectations.\" Is that the thought that stood out the most?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's the one that really stuck with me.\n\nTherapist: Alright. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not good enough for this job?\n\nPatient: Well, my boss's negative feedback is a big one. It seems like no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to get it right. And I know I've been struggling to keep up with deadlines lately, which makes me feel like I'm not meeting expectations.\n\nTherapist: I hear you. Those are valid points. Now, let's look at the evidence against that thought. What are some examples of times when you have met expectations or received positive feedback at work?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been a few projects where my boss seemed satisfied with my work. And I did receive a good performance review a few months ago. It's just hard to remember those moments when I'm feeling so discouraged.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. When we're feeling down, it's easy to focus on the negative and forget about the positive. That's why it's so important to gather evidence for and against our thoughts, to get a more balanced perspective. Based on the evidence you've shared, is there an alternative thought that might be more helpful or realistic?\n\nPatient: I suppose an alternative thought could be, \"I may not always meet expectations, but I have had successes in the past, and I'm capable of learning and improving.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges the challenges you've faced while also recognizing your past successes and your ability to grow. Now, if you were to believe that alternative thought, how do you think it would impact your emotions in that situation?\n\nPatient: I think I would still feel disappointed, maybe around 50 out of 100, but I wouldn't feel as anxious about my job security, maybe more like 40 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in your emotional response. It shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing our emotions. By challenging negative thoughts and generating alternative thoughts, we can start to shift our perspective and feel more balanced.\n\nPatient: I can see that. It's just hard to remember to do this in the moment when I'm feeling so overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge. It takes practice to make this a habit. One strategy that can help is to schedule a regular time each day to review your thoughts and emotions, maybe at the end of the workday or before bed. That way, you can start to build it into your routine.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I'll try setting aside some time each evening to reflect on my day and practice challenging negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Great. And remember, you don't have to do this perfectly. Even small shifts in perspective can make a big difference over time. Let's keep practicing this together, and we can troubleshoot any challenges that come up along the way.",
