  "transcript": "Patient: That makes sense. Adding that extra reflection does make the evidence feel more meaningful. I guess I just need to keep practicing and building up that positive evidence until it starts to outweigh the negative beliefs.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! It's all about consistent practice and gradually shifting the balance of evidence. And remember, even small pieces of evidence can add up over time to create significant change in your beliefs. Now, let's shift gears a bit and discuss your tendency to isolate yourself when you're feeling down. Can you tell me more about what that experience is like for you?\n\nPatient: It's like I just shut down and retreat into myself. I convince myself that no one wants to be around me when I'm in that state, so I avoid reaching out or making plans. I know it's not healthy, but it feels like the safest option in the moment.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that. It's a common response to feel like isolating ourselves when we're struggling emotionally. But as you said, it's not the most helpful response in the long run. Let's explore this a bit further. What thoughts tend to go through your mind when you feel the urge to isolate yourself?\n\nPatient: I usually think things like \"I'm too much of a burden right now\" or \"No one wants to deal with me when I'm like this.\" I also worry that if I do reach out, I'll just end up feeling rejected or misunderstood.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important insights. It seems like there are some negative predictions and assumptions happening there. Let's examine those thoughts a bit more closely. Do you have any actual evidence that you're a burden or that people don't want to be around you when you're struggling?\n\nPatient: When you put it that way, I guess I don't have concrete evidence. It's more of a feeling or a fear. I've never had a friend explicitly say they don't want to be around me when I'm down. But the fear still feels very real.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. Our fears and assumptions can feel incredibly powerful, even without concrete evidence to back them up. That's where behavioral experiments can be really helpful. We can design small experiments to test out those assumptions and see if the evidence supports them. For example, you could try reaching out to a trusted friend when you're feeling low and see how they respond. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: It makes sense logically, but it still feels scary. I worry that I'll be too much for them or that they'll confirm my fears.\n\nTherapist: I completely understand that fear. That's why we would approach it gradually and start with small, manageable steps. We could also come up with some coping statements or self-care plans for before and after the experiment, to help you feel more supported throughout the process. What might be a small step you could take in the direction of reaching out, even when you feel the urge to isolate?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could start by texting a friend, rather than calling or making plans to meet up. That feels a bit less daunting.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea! Texting can be a lower-pressure way to initiate contact and break the cycle of isolation. And we can come up with a plan for what to do if the response isn't what you hoped for, so you feel prepared for different outcomes. How does that feel to you?\n\nPatient: It still feels a bit scary, but having a plan does make it feel more manageable. I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful! We can work together to come up with a detailed plan for your experiment and practice some coping strategies to use alongside it. Remember, the goal isn't to completely eliminate the fear or discomfort, but rather to learn that you can handle it and that the outcome might not be as bad as you predict. Does this feel like a helpful approach to start combating the urge to isolate?\n\nPatient: Yes, it does. I appreciate you breaking it down into smaller steps and giving me tools to cope with the discomfort. It makes it feel more possible to face that fear.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that. Facing our fears is never easy, but having a plan and support can make a big difference. Let's spend some time now coming up with a detailed plan for your experiment and practicing some coping strategies. We can also explore any other situations where you notice the urge to isolate and brainstorm ways to break that cycle. How does that sound?",
