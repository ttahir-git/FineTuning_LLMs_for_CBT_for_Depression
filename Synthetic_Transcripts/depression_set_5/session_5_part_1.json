  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 5. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought monitoring and cognitive restructuring. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my ability to catch and challenge distorted thoughts. However, I've still been struggling with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness related to my career.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. It's a good sign that you're making progress. I understand that feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness can be overwhelming, especially when it comes to your career. Let's make sure to address that in today's session. How about we start by setting an agenda? What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my career-related concerns and how they're impacting my depression. I also want to discuss how I can stay motivated and consistent with therapy, as I mentioned last time. Maybe we can explore some strategies for managing those feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Alex. We can definitely focus on your career concerns and how they relate to your depression. We'll also discuss strategies for staying motivated and consistent with therapy, as well as managing feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness. To start, let's explore your career concerns a bit more. Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind regarding your career and how it's impacting your mood?",
