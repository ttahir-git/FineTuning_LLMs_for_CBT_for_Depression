  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 8. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care. It's been challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making progress slowly.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been making an effort to apply the techniques we've discussed. It's normal for it to feel challenging at times, but the fact that you're noticing progress is a positive sign. Can you tell me more about your experiences with setting boundaries and practicing self-care since our last session?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to say \"no\" more often when people ask me to do things that I don't have the energy for. It's difficult because I feel guilty, like I'm letting them down. But I'm starting to realize that I need to prioritize my own well-being too. As for self-care, I've been trying to carve out time for activities that I enjoy, like photography and going for walks in nature.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own well-being and setting boundaries, even when it feels challenging. The guilt you're experiencing is a common reaction, but it's something we can continue to work on. I'm also glad to hear that you've been making time for photography and nature walks, as those activities can be very nourishing for your mental health. \n\nGiven what you've shared, I'd like to suggest a few items for our agenda today. We could review your experiences with thought records and boundary-setting practice, continue exploring and reframing intermediate beliefs related to setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care, and introduce some additional distress tolerance techniques for managing overwhelming emotions. We can also discuss strategies for maintaining progress and coping with potential setbacks. What do you think about this plan, and is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan to me. I'm particularly interested in learning more distress tolerance techniques, as I sometimes struggle with overwhelming emotions. I think the other topics you mentioned are also relevant to what I've been working on.\n\nTherapist: Great, we'll make sure to focus on distress tolerance techniques today. Before we dive into that, let's start by reviewing your experiences with thought records and boundary-setting practice since our last session. Can you share some examples of when you used these techniques and how they worked for you?",
