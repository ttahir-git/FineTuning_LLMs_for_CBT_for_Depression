  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate your encouragement and support, Nova. It's been a challenging journey, but I feel like I'm making progress.\n\nTherapist: You absolutely are, Emilio. I'm curious, as we've been discussing boundary-setting and relapse prevention, what thoughts or concerns come to mind about continuing this work after our sessions end?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm a little worried that without the structure and accountability of our sessions, I might slip back into old patterns. It's been helpful to have this dedicated time to focus on my mental health.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's common for people to worry about maintaining progress after therapy ends. What do you think might be helpful in supporting your continued growth and well-being?\n\nPatient: I think having a clear plan and reminders of the skills I've learned will be important. Maybe I could set aside dedicated time each week to review my CBT toolbox and practice the techniques.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea. Building self-care and skill practice into your routine can help you maintain the progress you've made. Another helpful strategy is to identify potential triggers or challenges that might arise and plan how you'll respond using your CBT skills.\n\nPatient: Yeah, that makes sense. Like if I know I have a stressful work deadline coming up, I could plan to prioritize stress management techniques and self-care during that time.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Let's practice that now. Can you think of an upcoming situation that might be challenging for you, and walk me through how you might apply your CBT skills to manage it?\n\nPatient: Well, I have a big exam coming up in a few weeks. In the past, I've tended to get really anxious and overwhelmed, and I might neglect my self-care in favor of studying.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's break it down. What thoughts might come up for you as the exam approaches?\n\nPatient: I might think, \"I'm going to fail this exam,\" or \"If I don't do well, I'm not cut out for this program.\"\n\nTherapist: Those sound like some common cognitive distortions, like catastrophizing and all-or-nothing thinking. What might be a more helpful way to think about the exam?\n\nPatient: I could remind myself that one exam doesn't define my worth or abilities, and that I've prepared as best I can. I could also focus on the effort I've put in, rather than just the outcome.\n\nTherapist: Those are great alternative thoughts. How might your feelings and behaviors change if you approached the exam with those thoughts in mind?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel less anxious and more confident. I might be more likely to stick to a balanced study schedule and prioritize self-care, rather than getting caught up in anxious thoughts and overworking myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. As you continue to practice these skills, you'll likely find it easier to manage challenges like exams and maintain your well-being. Remember, setbacks are a normal part of the process, and having a plan in place can help you feel more prepared to handle them.",
