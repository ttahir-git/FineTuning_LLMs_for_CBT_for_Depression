  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job identifying the thoughts and beliefs that make it challenging to set boundaries with your family. Let's practice generating some assertive responses you can use in these situations. Imagine your mother asks you to come home for a family gathering, but you have prior commitments. How could you respond in a way that sets a clear boundary while still showing care for your family?\n\nPatient: I could say something like, \"I appreciate the invitation, and I love spending time with our family. However, I already have plans that I committed to. I'll do my best to stop by for part of the gathering, but I won't be able to stay the entire time.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent example of an assertive response. You're acknowledging your mother's invitation and expressing your love for your family while still maintaining your own boundaries. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and commitments. Setting boundaries doesn't mean you don't care about your family; it means you're taking care of yourself so that you can show up as your best self when you do spend time with them.\n\nPatient: I understand that logically, but it's still hard to put into practice. I feel like I'm letting them down.\n\nTherapist: It's natural to feel that way, especially when you've had a long-standing pattern of putting others' needs before your own. Let's explore the emotions that come up when you set boundaries with your family. What emotions do you experience, and how intense are they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I feel guilty, with an intensity of about 80. I also feel anxious, maybe around 70, because I'm worried about how my family will react.\n\nTherapist: Those are strong emotions, and it's important to acknowledge and validate them. At the same time, let's examine the thoughts behind these emotions. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel guilty and anxious about setting boundaries with your family?\n\nPatient: I think, \"I'm being selfish. I should be there for my family no matter what. If I don't do what they ask, they'll think I don't love them.\"\n\nTherapist: These thoughts are connected to some of the intermediate and core beliefs we've identified, such as \"If I don't meet my family's expectations, I'm a bad person\" and \"I'm selfish if I prioritize my own needs over my family's.\" Let's challenge these thoughts using the evidence for and against them. What evidence do you have that supports the thought \"I'm being selfish\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm putting my own needs before my family's, and that feels selfish.\n\nTherapist: Okay, now let's look at the evidence against this thought. Have there been times when you've set boundaries and still shown care and love for your family?\n\nPatient: Yes, there have been times when I've set boundaries and still found other ways to show my family I care, like calling them regularly or sending thoughtful gifts.\n\nTherapist: That's important evidence against the thought that you're being selfish. It shows that you can prioritize your own needs while still maintaining loving relationships with your family. Based on this evidence, what might be an alternative thought?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"Setting boundaries is an act of self-care, and it doesn't mean I'm being selfish. I can prioritize my own needs while still showing love and care for my family in other ways.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges the importance of self-care and the fact that you can maintain loving relationships while still setting boundaries. If you had this thought in mind, how intense would your feelings of guilt and anxiety be?\n\nPatient: I think my guilt would be around 50, and my anxiety would be closer to 40.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in intensity. This shows how challenging our thoughts and considering alternative perspectives can help us manage our emotions more effectively. As you continue to practice setting boundaries with your family, remember to use thought records to challenge any guilty or anxious thoughts that arise. Over time, it will become easier to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs while still maintaining close relationships with your family.",
