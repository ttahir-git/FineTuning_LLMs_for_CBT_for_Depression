  "transcript": "Patient: Last session, we discussed setting boundaries with my family and challenging the guilty thoughts that come up when I do. For homework, you asked me to continue practicing the thought records and setting small boundary-setting goals. I've been trying to do that, but it's been challenging.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty about the challenges you've faced with the homework. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been difficult for you?\n\nPatient: Well, I find it hard to identify the thoughts and emotions in the moment. I often only realize them after the situation has passed. And even when I do manage to set a boundary, the guilt can be overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: It's common to struggle with identifying thoughts and emotions in the moment, especially when you're just starting to practice these skills. The fact that you're able to recognize them after the situation is a good sign that you're developing more awareness. As for the guilt, that's something we can continue to work on together. Would you be willing to share an example of a boundary you set and the guilty thoughts that came up?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, my sister asked me to babysit my niece on short notice. Normally, I would have dropped everything to help, but I had planned to spend that evening working on a photography project. I told her I couldn't do it, and she seemed disappointed. Afterwards, I kept thinking, \"I'm a bad sibling. I should have put my niece's needs before my own.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. It's clear that you're working hard to set boundaries, even when it's difficult. The thoughts you mentioned, like \"I'm a bad sibling,\" are examples of all-or-nothing thinking, which is a common cognitive distortion. In this case, you're seeing the situation in black-and-white terms, without considering the shades of gray. Let's try to challenge this thought using the evidence-based thinking we've practiced. What evidence do you have that you're a bad sibling?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose I don't have much evidence. I've always been there for my sister and niece when they needed me. I guess this was just the first time I put my own needs first.\n\nTherapist: That's an important insight. It's not that you're a bad sibling; it's just that you're starting to prioritize your own needs, which is a healthy thing to do. What would you say to a friend who was in a similar situation and had the same thoughts?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that it's okay to take time for themselves and that setting boundaries doesn't mean they don't care about their family.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. It's often easier to give compassionate advice to others than it is to ourselves. Try to practice extending that same understanding and kindness to yourself. Remember, setting boundaries is an act of self-care, not selfishness.",
