  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the skills we've discussed, like the thought records and setting boundaries with my family. It's still challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making some progress.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've worked on and that you're noticing some progress. Can you tell me more about how the thought records have been going for you? Have you encountered any specific challenges or successes with them?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to fill out the thought records whenever I notice strong emotions or negative thoughts coming up, especially around family interactions and schoolwork. It's been helpful to write things down and try to challenge those thoughts. But sometimes it's hard to untangle my thoughts from my emotions, and I get stuck in that all-or-nothing thinking pattern.\n\nTherapist: It's common to struggle with untangling thoughts from emotions, and it's great that you're aware of the all-or-nothing thinking pattern. We can definitely work on that more today. How about setting boundaries with your family? How has that been going?\n\nPatient: Setting boundaries has been really difficult. I feel guilty even thinking about putting my needs first. I tried using \"I\" statements like we discussed, but I still feel like I'm being selfish.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging it can be to set boundaries, especially when you're not used to prioritizing your own needs. Remember that setting boundaries is an act of self-care, and it doesn't mean you're being selfish. It's about finding a balance between caring for yourself and others. We can explore this more today and practice some more assertive communication skills. Speaking of self-care, how did the photography-related activity go?\n\nPatient: The photography outing was really nice. It felt good to focus on something I enjoy and be out in nature. I journaled about it afterwards, and it helped me feel more grounded.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear! Engaging in activities you enjoy and finding ways to ground yourself are essential parts of self-care. Let's make sure to include some discussion about how to incorporate more of those activities into your routine. Based on what you've shared, it seems like we should prioritize working on untangling thoughts and emotions, setting boundaries with family, and continuing to practice self-care through activities like photography. Does that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think those are the main things I've been struggling with lately. I'm also wondering if we could talk more about managing stress related to school and work.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, managing stress related to school and work is an important topic. We can definitely include that in our agenda. So, to summarize, our main focuses for today will be:\n1. Untangling thoughts and emotions, and challenging all-or-nothing thinking\n2. Setting boundaries with family and practicing assertive communication\n3. Incorporating self-care activities, like photography, into your routine\n4. Managing stress related to school and work\n\nDoes that cover everything you'd like to work on today?\n\nPatient: Yes, that covers everything. I'm looking forward to working on these topics with you.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by exploring the challenges you've been facing with untangling thoughts and emotions. Can you give me an example of a situation where you found it difficult to separate your thoughts from your emotions?",
