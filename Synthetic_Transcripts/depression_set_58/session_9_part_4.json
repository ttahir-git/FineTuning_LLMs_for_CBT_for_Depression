  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job applying the thought record process to both the exam situation and the boundary-setting situation with your coworker. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to catch those automatic thoughts and reframe them in the moment. Before we wrap up today's session, let's discuss how you can continue to practice these techniques on your own.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I definitely want to keep working on challenging my negative thoughts and setting boundaries.\n\nTherapist: One way to continue practicing is to complete thought records whenever you notice strong emotions or negative thoughts. Try to fill out at least one thought record per day, focusing on situations where you feel overwhelmed, guilty, or anxious. This will help you build the habit of catching and reframing those thoughts in the moment.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can do that. I'll try to set aside some time each day to reflect on my thoughts and emotions.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. Another way to practice is to set small, achievable goals related to boundary-setting. For example, you could practice saying no to a small request from a coworker or friend, and then use a thought record to challenge any guilty thoughts that arise. As you build confidence in setting boundaries, you can gradually work up to more challenging situations.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of starting small and building up to bigger challenges.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's all about taking small steps and building momentum. Remember, setting boundaries is a skill that takes practice, so be patient with yourself and celebrate your successes along the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the encouragement. I'll definitely keep practicing.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. Before we end today's session, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now, and do you have any final thoughts or questions?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also hopeful. It's helpful to have a plan for practicing these techniques on my own. I don't have any other questions right now.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel tired after doing this kind of emotional work. I'm glad you're feeling hopeful and have a plan for moving forward. Remember, progress isn't always linear, so be kind to yourself if you have setbacks along the way. If any questions or concerns come up between now and our next session, feel free to reach out.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I'll definitely reach out if I need support.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. Let's go ahead and schedule our next session for [insert date and time]. In the meantime, keep practicing those thought records and boundary-setting skills. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress.\n\nPatient: Sounds good, I'll see you then. Thank you for today's session.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. Take care, and remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself as you continue this work.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Emilio's thought records and boundary-setting practice since the last session\n  - Explored intermediate beliefs related to setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care\n  - Reframed the belief \"If I don't help others when they ask, then I'm not a good person\" to \"I can be a good person by balancing helping others with taking care of myself.
