  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can give you an example of when I used thought records. Last week, I was feeling really overwhelmed with my coursework and my job at the animal shelter. I started thinking that I would never be able to keep up with everything and that I was going to fail my classes. I caught myself having these negative thoughts and decided to write them down in a thought record.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Can you walk me through the process of completing the thought record? What emotions were you experiencing, and how did you identify the cognitive distortions in your thinking?\n\nPatient: Well, I started by writing down the situation, which was feeling overwhelmed with my coursework and job. The emotions I was experiencing were anxiety, stress, and a sense of hopelessness. I rated the intensity of these emotions as pretty high, around 8 out of 10.\n\nThen, I wrote down the automatic thoughts I was having, like \"I'll never be able to keep up with everything\" and \"I'm going to fail my classes.\" As I looked at these thoughts, I realized that I was engaging in all-or-nothing thinking and catastrophizing.\n\nTherapist: You did a great job identifying those cognitive distortions. All-or-nothing thinking, also known as black-and-white thinking, is when we see things in extreme terms without considering the middle ground. Catastrophizing is when we assume the worst possible outcome will happen. What evidence did you find for and against these thoughts?\n\nPatient: When I thought about evidence against these thoughts, I remembered that I've been able to handle my coursework and job before, even though it's been challenging. I also reminded myself that one difficult week doesn't mean I'm going to fail my classes. As for evidence for the thoughts, I guess I was just focusing on how overwhelmed I felt in the moment.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you were able to find evidence against the negative thoughts. This is an important step in reframing our thoughts and finding more balanced perspectives. What was the outcome after completing the thought record? Did you notice any changes in the intensity of your emotions?\n\nPatient: After completing the thought record, I did feel a bit better. My anxiety and stress levels went down to about a 5 out of 10. I realized that I was jumping to conclusions and that I needed to take things one step at a time. It helped me feel more in control of the situation.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant improvement in your emotional state. This shows how powerful thought records can be in helping us challenge negative thoughts and find more balanced perspectives. You did an excellent job applying this technique.\n\nNow, let's talk about your experiences with setting boundaries since our last session. Can you share an example of when you practiced setting boundaries and how it went?\n\nPatient: One example is when my coworker at the animal shelter asked me to cover their shift last minute. Normally, I would have said yes without hesitation, even if I had other plans or needed time for myself. But this time, I remembered our discussion about setting boundaries and decided to say no.\n\nI told my coworker that I had plans and wouldn't be able to cover their shift. It was difficult because I felt guilty, like I was letting them down. But I also knew that I needed to prioritize my own needs and well-being.\n\nTherapist: Setting boundaries can be challenging, especially when we're used to putting others' needs before our own. It's natural to feel guilty or uncomfortable at first. But, as you said, prioritizing your own well-being is essential. How did your coworker respond, and how did you feel after setting that boundary?\n\nPatient: My coworker was understanding and said they would find someone else to cover their shift. After setting that boundary, I felt a sense of relief and pride in myself for standing up for my needs. It made me realize that setting boundaries is not selfish, but rather a form of self-care.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Setting boundaries is a crucial aspect of self-care, and it's wonderful that you were able to experience the benefits firsthand. As we continue to practice setting boundaries, it will become easier and more natural over time.\n\nNow, let's move on to discussing distress tolerance techniques. These are tools that can help you manage overwhelming emotions in the moment, especially when you're facing challenging situations or stressors. One effective technique is called \"grounding.\"",
