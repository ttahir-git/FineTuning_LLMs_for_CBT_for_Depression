  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate your support and encouragement. It's helpful to hear that setting boundaries is an act of self-care and not selfishness. I'll try to remember that when I'm struggling with guilty thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you found that perspective helpful. It takes practice to shift our thinking patterns, but with time and consistency, it becomes easier. Speaking of practicing, let's take a moment to practice some cognitive restructuring together. Are there any other situations or thoughts that have been bothering you this week?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been feeling stressed about my environmental science coursework. I keep thinking, \"I'm not smart enough to understand this material. I'm going to fail this class.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to work with. Let's use the thought record to break down this thought and see if we can reframe it. First, can you rate the intensity of the emotion you feel when you have this thought, on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I'd say it's around an 80.\n\nTherapist: Okay, now let's look at the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that you're not smart enough to understand the material?\n\nPatient: I've been struggling to grasp some of the concepts, and I got a lower grade on the last assignment than I hoped for.\n\nTherapist: That's valid evidence, but let's also consider the evidence against this thought. Have you had any successes in this class or other challenging courses?\n\nPatient: Well, I did get an A on the first exam, and I've done well in other science courses in the past.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're not smart enough. It shows that you have the ability to succeed in challenging courses. Now, let's look for alternative thoughts. Is there a more balanced way to view this situation?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could think, \"I may be struggling with some of the material right now, but I have a history of succeeding in challenging courses. With extra effort and support, I can improve my understanding and performance in this class.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent alternative thought. It acknowledges the current struggle but also recognizes your past successes and the potential for improvement. Now, with this new thought in mind, how intense is the emotion you feel, on that same 0-100 scale?\n\nPatient: It's gone down to about a 50.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant decrease in intensity. This shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing our emotions. By challenging the negative thought and finding a more balanced alternative, you were able to reduce the intensity of the emotion you felt. This is a skill you can practice with other negative thoughts as well.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll keep practicing this technique with other thoughts that come up.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, the more you practice, the easier it becomes. In addition to the thought records, another helpful technique for managing negative thoughts is the behavioral experiment. This involves testing out the validity of a negative thought by gathering evidence through action. For example, you could test the thought \"I'm not smart enough to understand this material\" by seeking help from your professor or a tutor and seeing if your understanding improves.",
