  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 9. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret your non-verbal cues, so please let me know if I miss or misinterpret anything. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being transparent about your limitations. I feel comfortable continuing our sessions with this in mind.\n\nTherapist: Great, I appreciate your understanding. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been since our last session? How has your mood been, and have you noticed any changes or insights?\n\nPatient: I've been doing alright. My mood has been relatively stable, although I still have moments of feeling overwhelmed and hopeless. I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and setting boundaries, but it's been challenging at times.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that your mood has been stable overall, and it's understandable that you still experience moments of feeling overwhelmed and hopeless. Practicing these techniques can be challenging, especially when you're just starting out. Can you share a specific situation where you found it difficult to use thought records or set boundaries?\n\nPatient: Last week, a coworker asked me to cover their shift at the animal shelter on short notice. I had plans to work on a photography project that day, but I felt guilty saying no. I tried to use a thought record to challenge my guilt, but I ended up agreeing to cover the shift anyway.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. It's a great opportunity for us to explore how we can apply the techniques we've discussed. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize? We could review your homework, discuss the challenges you faced with thought records and boundary-setting, and explore any other topics that are important to you.\n\nPatient: I think it would be helpful to review my homework and discuss the challenges I faced with the thought records and boundary-setting. I'm also interested in learning more about how my intermediate and core beliefs might be influencing my thoughts and behaviors.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. We'll start by reviewing your homework and discussing the challenges you encountered. Then, we'll explore how your intermediate and core beliefs might be contributing to those challenges. As we work through these topics, we'll identify any cognitive distortions that may be present and practice reframing your thoughts. Does this agenda sound good to you?",
