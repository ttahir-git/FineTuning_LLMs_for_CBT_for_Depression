  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 15. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the skills we've discussed, like using thought records and setting boundaries with my family. It's been challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making some progress.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've worked on and that you're noticing some progress. Can you tell me more about your experiences with using thought records and setting boundaries? What has been challenging, and what successes have you had?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to fill out thought records when I notice myself feeling really down or anxious. It's helped me to identify some of the negative thoughts that contribute to those feelings. The challenging part has been remembering to do it in the moment, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed. As for setting boundaries, I had a conversation with my mom about how often she calls me, and I was able to express my needs without feeling guilty. That felt like a big win.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been able to use thought records to identify negative thoughts and that you had a successful conversation with your mom about setting boundaries. Remembering to use these skills in the moment can be challenging, but with practice, it will become more automatic. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to continue working on identifying and challenging my negative thoughts and core beliefs. I also want to discuss some strategies for managing stress, especially with work and school.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan. We can start by reviewing some of the thought records you've completed since our last session and explore any patterns or themes that emerge. We can also discuss some stress management techniques, such as mindfulness and time management strategies. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds great. I'm ready to get started.",
