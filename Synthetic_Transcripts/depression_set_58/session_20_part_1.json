  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the stress management techniques we discussed, like deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. It's been helpful, but I still find myself struggling with setting boundaries, especially with my family.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the stress management techniques have been helpful for you. Setting boundaries can be challenging, particularly with family. Let's explore that further today. Before we do, let's take a moment to check in on your overall mood and any other experiences or changes since our last session. How would you describe your mood over the past week?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. I've had some good days where I feel motivated and hopeful, but I've also had days where I feel overwhelmed and sad. I think the boundary-setting issue with my family has been a significant contributor to my low moods.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience fluctuations in mood, and it's good that you're able to identify the boundary-setting issue as a contributing factor. We can definitely focus on that today. Other than the boundary-setting, have there been any other significant events or changes since our last session?\n\nPatient: Not really, just the usual work and school stress. I've been trying to keep up with my self-care routines, like going for walks and journaling, but it's been challenging with my busy schedule.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're making an effort to prioritize self-care, even with your busy schedule. Let's keep that in mind as we plan our agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, it seems like focusing on boundary-setting, particularly with your family, is a priority. We can also review your relapse prevention plan and discuss how to continue building on the skills you've learned in therapy. What are your thoughts on that?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I definitely want to focus on the boundary-setting issue, and I think reviewing the relapse prevention plan would be helpful too.\n\nTherapist: Great, so our agenda for today will include:\n1. Exploring and problem-solving the challenges you've faced with setting boundaries, particularly with your family\n2. Reviewing your relapse prevention plan and discussing how to continue building on the skills you've learned in therapy\n3. Checking in on your progress with stress management techniques and self-care routines\n\nDoes this agenda work for you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
