  "transcript": "Therapist: Grounding techniques help you stay present in the moment by focusing on your senses, rather than getting caught up in overwhelming thoughts or emotions. One simple grounding exercise is the 5-4-3-2-1 method. \n\nWhen you notice yourself feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to identify:\n- 5 things you can see around you\n- 4 things you can touch or feel\n- 3 things you can hear\n- 2 things you can smell\n- 1 thing you can taste\n\nBy focusing on your senses, you anchor yourself in the present moment and give your mind a break from the overwhelming thoughts or emotions. This technique can be particularly helpful when you're feeling anxious or stressed at work or school. What do you think about this technique, Emilio?\n\nPatient: I like the sound of that. It seems like a simple way to bring myself back to the present when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I can definitely see myself using this at work when things get stressful.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! The 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique is a great tool to have in your coping skills toolbox. Remember, the more you practice using it, the more effective it will become. I encourage you to try it out this week whenever you notice yourself feeling overwhelmed or stressed.\n\nAnother helpful distress tolerance technique is deep breathing. When we're feeling anxious or overwhelmed, our breathing often becomes shallow and rapid, which can actually increase feelings of anxiety. By focusing on taking slow, deep breaths, we can help our bodies relax and reduce the intensity of the emotions we're experiencing.\n\nOne simple deep breathing exercise is called \"square breathing\" or \"box breathing.\" It involves inhaling for a count of four, holding the breath for a count of four, exhaling for a count of four, and then holding the breath again for a count of four before repeating the cycle. This technique can help slow down your breathing and bring a sense of calm to your mind and body. What are your thoughts on this technique, Emilio?\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I've noticed that when I'm feeling anxious, my breathing does get shallow and fast. I like the idea of having a structured breathing exercise to help calm me down. I'll definitely give square breathing a try.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Emilio. Deep breathing exercises like square breathing can be very effective in managing overwhelming emotions. Remember, you can use this technique anytime, anywhere \u2013 whether you're at work, school, or home. The more you practice, the more natural it will feel.\n\nAs we continue to work on managing overwhelming emotions, it's also important to explore the thoughts and beliefs that may be contributing to these emotions. In our previous sessions, we've discussed the concept of intermediate beliefs and how they can influence our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. I'd like to spend some time now exploring any intermediate beliefs that may be related to your experiences of feeling overwhelmed and struggling to set boundaries.",
