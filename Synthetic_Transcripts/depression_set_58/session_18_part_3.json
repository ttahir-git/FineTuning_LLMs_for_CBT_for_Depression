  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you'd like to explore how your negative core beliefs may be influencing your feelings of guilt and worthlessness in relation to your family's expectations. Let's dive into that a bit more. Can you give me an example of a situation where you felt guilty or unworthy because you felt you weren't meeting your family's expectations?\n\nPatient: Sure, I can think of a recent example. Last week, I had a big exam coming up, and I didn't do as well as I had hoped. I knew my parents would be disappointed, and I immediately started feeling guilty and like I had let them down. I had thoughts like, \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'll never be able to make my family proud.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Emilio. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle, which illustrates how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. In this situation, the activating event was not doing as well as you had hoped on your exam. The thoughts that arose were \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'll never be able to make my family proud,\" which then led to feelings of guilt and worthlessness. Is that accurate?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's exactly right. It's like a vicious cycle \u2013 the thoughts feed into the feelings, which then reinforce the thoughts.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Emilio. That's why it's so important to identify and challenge these negative thoughts and beliefs. By doing so, we can start to break the cycle and create more balanced, self-affirming thoughts that lead to more positive feelings and behaviors.\n\nLet's look at the thought \"I'm not good enough.\" This thought likely stems from the core belief \"I'm a failure,\" which we've identified previously. What evidence do you have that challenges this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose I could look at my past academic successes, like the exams I have done well on and the positive feedback I've received from my professors. I've also been able to maintain a job while going to school, which shows that I'm capable of managing multiple responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: Excellent, Emilio! You've provided some great examples of evidence that challenge the thought \"I'm not good enough.\" By focusing on these successes and strengths, we can start to build a more balanced, realistic view of yourself.\n\nNow, let's look at the thought \"I'll never be able to make my family proud.\" This thought seems to be related to the intermediate belief \"If I don't meet my family's expectations, I'm letting them down.\" What do you think about this belief? Is it based on facts or feelings?\n\nPatient: When I really think about it, I can see that this belief is more based on feelings than facts. My family has expressed pride in me for things that aren't related to academics or career success, like my kindness and creativity. It's just hard to shake that feeling of needing to meet their expectations in order to be worthy of their pride.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. It's common for our feelings to cloud our perception of reality, especially when it comes to deeply-held beliefs about ourselves and our relationships. By examining the evidence and challenging these beliefs, we can start to create a more balanced, self-affirming perspective.\n\nOne way to do this is by creating a new, more adaptive belief to replace the old, negative one. For example, instead of \"If I don't meet my family's expectations, I'm letting them down,\" you could try \"My worth is not solely defined by meeting my family's expectations. I can still be proud of myself for my efforts and accomplishments, even if they don't align with what my family wants for me.\"\n\nHow does that new belief feel to you?",
