  "transcript": "Patient: Yes, that makes sense. I can see how my negative thoughts lead to feelings of sadness and then to behaviors like isolating myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. Now, let's talk about cognitive distortions. These are common patterns of thinking that can contribute to negative emotions. Some examples include all-or-nothing thinking, where you see things in black and white terms, or overgeneralization, where you assume that because something happened once, it will always happen. Do any of these sound familiar to you?\n\nPatient: I think I do a lot of all-or-nothing thinking. Like, if I don't get an A on a test, I feel like a complete failure, even if I still did well.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of all-or-nothing thinking, Emilio. Another cognitive distortion that might be relevant for you is \"disqualifying the positive,\" where you dismiss positive experiences or achievements as not counting. For instance, you might focus on the one negative comment you received on a work project, rather than the many positive ones. Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Definitely. I tend to dwell on the negative feedback and ignore the positive, which leaves me feeling like I'm not doing well enough at work.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're able to recognize that pattern, Emilio. As we continue with CBT, we'll work on identifying these cognitive distortions when they occur and learning how to challenge and reframe them. This can help you develop a more balanced and realistic view of yourself and your experiences. How do you feel about that?\n\nPatient: It sounds challenging, but I'm willing to give it a try. I know I need to change the way I think about myself and my life if I want to feel better.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Emilio. I'm confident that with practice, you can learn to recognize and challenge these negative thought patterns. In our next session, we'll dive deeper into specific techniques for doing this, such as examining the evidence for and against your negative thoughts, and generating alternative interpretations. For now, I'd like to encourage you to continue using the thought record to track your negative thoughts and the situations that trigger them. This will give us more material to work with in our upcoming sessions. How does that sound?",
