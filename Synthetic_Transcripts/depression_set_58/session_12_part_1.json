  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like setting boundaries with my family and using thought records. It's been challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making progress slowly.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been implementing the techniques we've discussed and that you're noticing some progress, even if it feels slow at times. Can you share a bit more about your experiences with setting boundaries and using thought records since our last session?\n\nPatient: Sure. I had a situation last week where my mom asked me to come over for dinner, but I had already made plans with a friend. Normally, I would have canceled my plans and gone to my mom's, but I decided to set a boundary and stick to my original plans. It was difficult, and I felt guilty afterwards, but I also felt a sense of relief for prioritizing my own needs.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of setting a boundary and prioritizing your own needs, even when it's difficult. It's normal to feel guilty, especially when it's a new experience. Did you use a thought record to work through the guilt you felt afterwards?\n\nPatient: I did. I wrote down my thoughts and emotions and tried to challenge the negative thoughts. It helped me see that setting boundaries doesn't make me a bad person and that it's okay to prioritize my own plans sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. Using thought records to challenge negative thoughts and reframe your perspective is a powerful tool. I'm glad it helped you in that situation. Now, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I'd like to continue working on setting boundaries and managing the guilt that comes with it. I also want to discuss strategies for maintaining my progress and coping with potential setbacks.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. I'd also like to introduce some additional cognitive restructuring techniques to help you challenge negative thoughts more effectively. We can start by reviewing your thought records and experiences with setting boundaries since our last session, then move on to discussing strategies for maintaining progress and coping with setbacks. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds perfect. I'm looking forward to learning more cognitive restructuring techniques and discussing strategies for maintaining progress.",
