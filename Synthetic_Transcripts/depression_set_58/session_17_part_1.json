  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your support. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like mindful breathing and keeping a Positive Data Log. It's been helpful to challenge my negative thoughts and focus on evidence that supports my new core belief. However, I've still had some rough days where I feel overwhelmed and down on myself.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've found the techniques helpful, even if there have been some challenging days. It's normal to have ups and downs in the process of managing depression. Can you tell me more about what's been contributing to those rough days?\n\nPatient: Work has been really stressful lately. We've been short-staffed at the animal shelter, so I've been picking up extra shifts. It's been hard to balance that with school and find time for self-care. When I'm exhausted and stressed, it's easier for those negative thoughts to creep in.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense. Stress can definitely make it harder to manage depressive symptoms. Let's make sure to discuss stress management and self-care strategies today. How have you been feeling emotionally? Have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. Some days I feel more hopeful and motivated, especially after practicing mindfulness or spending time in nature. But other days, I feel really drained and have a hard time focusing on my classes or enjoying the things I usually like to do. I've also been feeling guilty about not being able to do more at work and keep up with everything.\n\nTherapist: It's good that you're noticing those patterns and the connection between your mood and your activities. We can explore that further today. Guilt is a common emotion that can be tied to some of those intermediate and core beliefs we've been working on. Let's keep that in mind as we review your Positive Data Log and thought records. Speaking of which, how has the homework been going?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to keep up with the Positive Data Log and thought records. It's been helpful to write things down and challenge those negative thoughts. I went on a hike last weekend, which felt really good. And I reached out to a coworker to grab coffee, which was nice. But I didn't get around to setting aside time for a creative project. I guess I'm struggling with prioritizing that when I feel like I have so many other responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you were able to go on a hike and connect with a coworker. Those are important steps in building a support system and engaging in activities that bring you fulfillment. It's also understandable that it's challenging to prioritize creative projects when you're juggling work and school. We can brainstorm some ways to break that down into smaller, more manageable steps. \n\nGiven what you've shared, here are some topics I think could be helpful to focus on today:\n\n1. Reviewing your Positive Data Log and thought records\n2. Discussing stress management and self-care strategies, especially in the context of your busy schedule\n3. Exploring the guilt you've been feeling and how it relates to your intermediate and core beliefs\n4. Brainstorming ways to prioritize creative projects and other fulfilling activities\n\nDoes that sound like a good agenda to you? Is there anything else you'd like to make sure we cover today?",
