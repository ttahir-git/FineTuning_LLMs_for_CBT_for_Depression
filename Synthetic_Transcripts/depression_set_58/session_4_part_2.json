  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for CBT session 4 with Emilio:\n\nPatient: Sure, I had a negative thought the other day when I received a lower grade than expected on a biology exam. My initial thought was, \"I'm not smart enough to succeed in this program.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Emilio. Let's break down this thought using the thought record. In the situation column, you would write about receiving the lower grade on the biology exam. Under emotions, you might list feelings like disappointment, frustration, or sadness, along with their intensity on a scale of 0-100. What emotions did you experience in that moment?\n\nPatient: I felt really disappointed in myself and frustrated that I didn't do better. I'd say the disappointment was around an 80 and the frustration was about a 70.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's record those emotions and their intensities. Now, let's look at the automatic thought you identified: \"I'm not smart enough to succeed in this program.\" This thought seems to be an example of all-or-nothing thinking, where you see things in extreme, black-and-white terms. Would you agree with that?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess I was being pretty hard on myself. It's just one exam, but I felt like it meant I couldn't succeed in the entire program.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. All-or-nothing thinking is a common cognitive distortion that can lead to feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness. Let's look for evidence that supports or refutes this thought. What evidence do you have that you're not smart enough to succeed in the program?\n\nPatient: Well, the lower grade on the exam is one piece of evidence, I suppose.\n\nTherapist: Okay, that's one piece of evidence. Now, let's look for evidence that contradicts this thought. Have you had any successes in your courses so far?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. I've gotten good grades on other assignments and exams. And I've been able to understand most of the material we've covered.\n\nTherapist: Great! That's important evidence to consider. Let's add that to the \"Evidence Against\" column. Is there any other evidence that suggests you are capable of succeeding in the program?\n\nPatient: I guess the fact that I was accepted into the program in the first place means that the admissions committee believed I could handle it.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! That's another strong piece of evidence against the thought that you're not smart enough. Now, let's generate an alternative thought based on the evidence we've gathered. What's a more balanced way to view this situation?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"One lower grade doesn't define my entire academic ability. I've had successes in the program so far, and I'm capable of learning and improving.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent alternative thought, Emilio! It acknowledges the disappointment of the lower grade but also recognizes your capabilities and potential for growth. How do you feel when you consider this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit more hopeful and less discouraged. The disappointment is probably around a 50 now, and the frustration is closer to a 40.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in your emotional state, Emilio. By challenging the initial negative thought and generating a more balanced alternative, you've been able to reduce the intensity of your negative emotions. This is a great example of how thought challenging can be effective in managing depressive symptoms.",
