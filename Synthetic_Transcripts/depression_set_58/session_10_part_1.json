  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 10. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and setting boundaries, but it's still challenging at times. I find myself falling into old patterns of negative thinking and feeling guilty when I try to prioritize my own needs.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed, even though it's not always easy. Changing long-standing patterns of thinking and behavior takes time and practice. I'm here to support you through this process. Let's start by setting an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on? We could review your thought records and boundary-setting practice, explore any challenges you've encountered, and discuss strategies for maintaining progress and coping with setbacks. What feels most important to you right now?\n\nPatient: I think reviewing my thought records and boundary-setting practice would be helpful. I've noticed that I struggle with certain situations more than others, and I'd like to explore why that might be. I'm also interested in discussing strategies for maintaining progress and coping with setbacks, as I've had a few moments where I felt like I was backsliding into old habits.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan for our session today. We'll start by reviewing your thought records and boundary-setting practice, paying special attention to the situations where you've struggled the most. We'll explore the thoughts and beliefs that might be contributing to those challenges. Then, we'll discuss strategies for maintaining progress and coping with setbacks, including how to recognize when you might be slipping into old patterns and what you can do to get back on track. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds perfect. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into these topics and gaining more tools to help me manage my depression and anxiety.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your thought records. Can you share an example of a situation where you struggled to challenge negative thoughts or set boundaries?",
