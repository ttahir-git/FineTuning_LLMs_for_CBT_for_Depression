  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's explore some of the intermediate beliefs that may be contributing to your feelings of overwhelm and difficulty setting boundaries. Intermediate beliefs are often in the form of \"if-then\" statements or rules that we hold about ourselves, others, or the world around us. They can influence our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in various situations.\n\nFor example, an intermediate belief related to setting boundaries might be, \"If I say no to others, then they will think I'm selfish or uncaring.\" Can you think of any intermediate beliefs that may be affecting your ability to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs?\n\nPatient: I think one belief that comes up for me is, \"If I don't help others when they ask, then I'm not a good person.\" I feel like I have to put others' needs before my own, even if it means sacrificing my own well-being.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. This belief that you need to put others' needs before your own in order to be a good person can make it very difficult to set boundaries and prioritize self-care. Let's explore this belief a bit further.\n\nCan you think of any evidence that supports this belief? Have there been times when putting others' needs first has led to positive outcomes or made you feel like a good person?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess when I help others, they often express gratitude and appreciation. That makes me feel good about myself, like I'm making a positive difference in their lives.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point. Helping others and receiving appreciation can certainly contribute to feelings of being a good person. However, it's important to recognize that you can still be a good person while also setting boundaries and taking care of yourself.\n\nLet's consider some evidence against this belief. Have there been times when putting others' needs first has led to negative consequences for you, such as feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or neglecting your own needs?\n\nPatient: Yes, there have been many times when I've taken on too much and ended up feeling burnt out and resentful. I've also neglected my own needs, like skipping meals or not getting enough sleep, because I was too busy helping others.\n\nTherapist: Those are important examples of how always putting others' needs first can have negative consequences for your own well-being. It's essential to find a balance between helping others and taking care of yourself.\n\nAnother point to consider is that setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs can actually make you a better friend, family member, or colleague. When you take care of yourself, you have more energy and resources to support others in a sustainable way.\n\nWhat do you think about reframing this belief to something like, \"I can be a good person by balancing helping others with taking care of myself. Setting boundaries allows me to support others in a sustainable way.\"\n\nPatient: I like that reframing. It makes sense that taking care of myself can actually make me a better friend and colleague in the long run. It's just hard to break the habit of always saying yes to others.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, changing long-held beliefs and patterns can be challenging. It takes practice and patience with yourself. Remember that setting boundaries is a skill that you can develop over time, and it's okay to start small.\n\nAs you continue to practice setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care, pay attention to the thoughts and emotions that come up. Use the thought records and distress tolerance techniques we've discussed to manage any overwhelming emotions and challenge unhelpful thoughts.\n\nBefore we wrap up today's session, let's discuss some homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue using thought records to track negative thoughts and identify cognitive distortions, particularly in situations where you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to set boundaries.\n\nI also encourage you to practice the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique and square breathing whenever you notice yourself feeling anxious or stressed. Remember, the more you practice these techniques, the more effective they will become.\n\nFinally, I'd like you to continue practicing setting boundaries in small ways, both at work and in your personal life. Pay attention to the thoughts and emotions that arise when you set boundaries, and use your thought records to challenge any unhelpful beliefs.\n\nWhat do you think about this homework plan, Emilio? Do you have any questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: The homework plan seems manageable. I'm definitely going to keep practicing the grounding and breathing techniques, as I think those will be helpful for managing my anxiety. Setting boundaries is still challenging, but I'll try to start small and work on challenging those unhelpful beliefs.\n\nTherapist: That sounds great, Emilio. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have setbacks along the way. The important thing is that you keep practicing and being patient with yourself.\n\nBefore we end today's session, let's do a quick check-in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also hopeful. It's helpful to have these techniques and reframed beliefs to work with. I know it won't be easy, but I'm committed to making changes and prioritizing my well-being.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling hopeful and committed to making changes. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nThank you for your hard work and openness in today's session, Emilio. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Until then, take care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Emilio's experiences with thought records and boundary-setting practice since the last session\n  - Introduced distress tolerance techniques: 5-4-3-2-1 grounding and square breathing\n  - Explored intermediate beliefs related to setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care\n  - Reframed the belief \"If I don't help others when they ask, then I'm not a good person\" to \"I can be a good person by balancing helping others with taking care of myself.
