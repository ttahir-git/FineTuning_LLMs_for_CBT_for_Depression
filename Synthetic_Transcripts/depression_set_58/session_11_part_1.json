  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. I want to start by acknowledging my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to keep up with the thought records and boundary-setting practice, but it's been challenging at times. I've noticed that I still struggle with feelings of guilt when setting boundaries, even though I know it's important for my well-being.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been working on the thought records and boundary-setting practice. It's normal to experience challenges and setbacks along the way. Recognizing these difficulties is an important part of the process. Let's explore those feelings of guilt a bit more. Can you share a specific situation where you felt guilty about setting a boundary?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, a friend asked me to help them move on short notice. I had planned to spend that day focusing on self-care and catching up on schoolwork, but I felt guilty saying no. I ended up helping them, but I felt resentful and exhausted afterward.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to work with. Let's break this down using a thought record. What emotions did you experience when your friend asked for help, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt guilty, with an intensity of about 80. I also felt anxious, maybe around 60, because I didn't want to disappoint my friend.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so guilt and anxiety were the primary emotions. What automatic thoughts went through your mind when you considered saying no to your friend?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"If I don't help my friend, they'll think I'm selfish and uncaring. A good friend would always be there to help, no matter what.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are quite powerful and seem to be connected to some of the intermediate beliefs we've discussed before, like \"If I don't help others when they ask, then I'm not a good person.\" Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"If I don't help my friend, they'll think I'm selfish and uncaring.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, my friend might have been disappointed or frustrated if I said no. They might have had to find someone else to help on short notice.\n\nTherapist: That's possible. Now, what evidence do you have against this thought?\n\nPatient: My friend has told me before that they understand when I need to prioritize my own needs. They've also had to say no to me in the past due to their own commitments, and I didn't think they were selfish or uncaring.\n\nTherapist: That's an important piece of evidence. It shows that your friend is capable of understanding and respecting your needs, just as you've done for them. Based on the evidence for and against, what might be an alternative thought?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"Saying no to my friend doesn't mean I'm selfish or uncaring. I can be a good friend while also taking care of myself. My friend has shown understanding in the past, and our friendship can handle occasional disappointments.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges the importance of self-care and the strength of your friendship. If you had this thought in mind, how intense would your feelings of guilt and anxiety be?\n\nPatient: I think my guilt would be around 40, and my anxiety would be closer to 30.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in intensity. This shows how challenging our automatic thoughts and considering alternative perspectives can help us manage our emotions more effectively. Let's set an agenda for today's session. We can continue working on reframing intermediate beliefs related to setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care, and we can also discuss strategies for maintaining progress and coping with potential setbacks. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'd also like to discuss how to handle situations where I need to set boundaries with family members, as that's been particularly challenging for me.",
