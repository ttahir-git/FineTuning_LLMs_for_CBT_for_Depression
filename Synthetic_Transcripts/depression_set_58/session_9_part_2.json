  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your homework. Can you share some of the thought records you completed since our last session?\n\nPatient: Sure. One situation that stood out to me was when I received a lower grade than expected on a biology exam. My initial thoughts were, \"I'm not smart enough to pursue this degree\" and \"I'll never be able to have a successful career in environmental science.\" The emotions I experienced were disappointment, frustration, and hopelessness, all around 80% intensity.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. I can understand why that situation would lead to those thoughts and emotions. Let's explore this further. What evidence did you find for and against the thought \"I'm not smart enough to pursue this degree\"?\n\nPatient: Well, the evidence for that thought is that I didn't perform as well as I wanted to on the exam. However, the evidence against it is that I have successfully completed other courses in my program and have received positive feedback from my professors in the past.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. You've identified evidence that challenges the validity of that negative thought. What about the thought \"I'll never be able to have a successful career in environmental science\"? What evidence did you find for and against that thought?\n\nPatient: The evidence for that thought is that I'm struggling in some of my courses, and I worry that I won't be able to find a job after graduation. However, the evidence against it is that I have a strong passion for environmental science, and I've gained valuable experience through my work at the animal shelter. I also know that many successful people have faced challenges and setbacks in their careers.\n\nTherapist: Excellent work in identifying evidence against those negative thoughts. It's important to recognize that setbacks and challenges are a normal part of the learning process and don't necessarily predict long-term success. Now, let's look at how you can reframe those thoughts based on the evidence you've gathered. What would be a more balanced and realistic way to view this situation?\n\nPatient: I could reframe the thought \"I'm not smart enough to pursue this degree\" to something like, \"I may struggle with certain concepts, but I have the ability to learn and improve. One exam grade doesn't define my overall intelligence or potential.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic reframe! You're acknowledging the challenge while also recognizing your ability to grow and learn from it. How about the thought \"I'll never be able to have a successful career in environmental science\"? How can you reframe that based on the evidence you identified?\n\nPatient: I could reframe it to, \"Pursuing a career in environmental science may have its challenges, but my passion, experience, and determination will help me overcome obstacles and find success in the long run.\"\n\nTherapist: I really like that reframe. You're acknowledging the potential challenges while also focusing on your strengths and resilience. How did the process of completing this thought record impact your emotions?\n\nPatient: After going through the process, my feelings of disappointment, frustration, and hopelessness decreased from around 80% intensity to about 50%. It helped me see the situation in a more balanced way and reminded me that one setback doesn't define my entire future.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in your emotional intensity, and it demonstrates the power of challenging negative thoughts and reframing them based on evidence. You did an excellent job with this thought record. Let's discuss how you can apply this process to the situation you mentioned earlier, where you struggled to set boundaries with your coworker who asked you to cover their shift.",
