Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care. It's been challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making progress slowly.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been making an effort to apply the techniques we've discussed. It's normal for it to feel challenging at times, but the fact that you're noticing progress is a positive sign. Can you tell me more about your experiences with setting boundaries and practicing self-care since our last session?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to say \"no\" more often when people ask me to do things that I don't have the energy for. It's difficult because I feel guilty, like I'm letting them down. But I'm starting to realize that I need to prioritize my own well-being too. As for self-care, I've been trying to carve out time for activities that I enjoy, like photography and going for walks in nature.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're recognizing the importance of prioritizing your own well-being and setting boundaries, even when it feels challenging. The guilt you're experiencing is a common reaction, but it's something we can continue to work on. I'm also glad to hear that you've been making time for photography and nature walks, as those activities can be very nourishing for your mental health. \n\nGiven what you've shared, I'd like to suggest a few items for our agenda today. We could review your experiences with thought records and boundary-setting practice, continue exploring and reframing intermediate beliefs related to setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care, and introduce some additional distress tolerance techniques for managing overwhelming emotions. We can also discuss strategies for maintaining progress and coping with potential setbacks. What do you think about this plan, and is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan to me. I'm particularly interested in learning more distress tolerance techniques, as I sometimes struggle with overwhelming emotions. I think the other topics you mentioned are also relevant to what I've been working on.\n\nTherapist: Great, we'll make sure to focus on distress tolerance techniques today. Before we dive into that, let's start by reviewing your experiences with thought records and boundary-setting practice since our last session. Can you share some examples of when you used these techniques and how they worked for you?\n\nPatient: Sure, I can give you an example of when I used thought records. Last week, I was feeling really overwhelmed with my coursework and my job at the animal shelter. I started thinking that I would never be able to keep up with everything and that I was going to fail my classes. I caught myself having these negative thoughts and decided to write them down in a thought record.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Can you walk me through the process of completing the thought record? What emotions were you experiencing, and how did you identify the cognitive distortions in your thinking?\n\nPatient: Well, I started by writing down the situation, which was feeling overwhelmed with my coursework and job. The emotions I was experiencing were anxiety, stress, and a sense of hopelessness. I rated the intensity of these emotions as pretty high, around 8 out of 10.\n\nThen, I wrote down the automatic thoughts I was having, like \"I'll never be able to keep up with everything\" and \"I'm going to fail my classes.\" As I looked at these thoughts, I realized that I was engaging in all-or-nothing thinking and catastrophizing.\n\nTherapist: You did a great job identifying those cognitive distortions. All-or-nothing thinking, also known as black-and-white thinking, is when we see things in extreme terms without considering the middle ground. Catastrophizing is when we assume the worst possible outcome will happen. What evidence did you find for and against these thoughts?\n\nPatient: When I thought about evidence against these thoughts, I remembered that I've been able to handle my coursework and job before, even though it's been challenging. I also reminded myself that one difficult week doesn't mean I'm going to fail my classes. As for evidence for the thoughts, I guess I was just focusing on how overwhelmed I felt in the moment.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you were able to find evidence against the negative thoughts. This is an important step in reframing our thoughts and finding more balanced perspectives. What was the outcome after completing the thought record? Did you notice any changes in the intensity of your emotions?\n\nPatient: After completing the thought record, I did feel a bit better. My anxiety and stress levels went down to about a 5 out of 10. I realized that I was jumping to conclusions and that I needed to take things one step at a time. It helped me feel more in control of the situation.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant improvement in your emotional state. This shows how powerful thought records can be in helping us challenge negative thoughts and find more balanced perspectives. You did an excellent job applying this technique.\n\nNow, let's talk about your experiences with setting boundaries since our last session. Can you share an example of when you practiced setting boundaries and how it went?\n\nPatient: One example is when my coworker at the animal shelter asked me to cover their shift last minute. Normally, I would have said yes without hesitation, even if I had other plans or needed time for myself. But this time, I remembered our discussion about setting boundaries and decided to say no.\n\nI told my coworker that I had plans and wouldn't be able to cover their shift. It was difficult because I felt guilty, like I was letting them down. But I also knew that I needed to prioritize my own needs and well-being.\n\nTherapist: Setting boundaries can be challenging, especially when we're used to putting others' needs before our own. It's natural to feel guilty or uncomfortable at first. But, as you said, prioritizing your own well-being is essential. How did your coworker respond, and how did you feel after setting that boundary?\n\nPatient: My coworker was understanding and said they would find someone else to cover their shift. After setting that boundary, I felt a sense of relief and pride in myself for standing up for my needs. It made me realize that setting boundaries is not selfish, but rather a form of self-care.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Setting boundaries is a crucial aspect of self-care, and it's wonderful that you were able to experience the benefits firsthand. As we continue to practice setting boundaries, it will become easier and more natural over time.\n\nNow, let's move on to discussing distress tolerance techniques. These are tools that can help you manage overwhelming emotions in the moment, especially when you're facing challenging situations or stressors. One effective technique is called \"grounding.\"\n\nTherapist: Grounding techniques help you stay present in the moment by focusing on your senses, rather than getting caught up in overwhelming thoughts or emotions. One simple grounding exercise is the 5-4-3-2-1 method. \n\nWhen you notice yourself feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to identify:\n- 5 things you can see around you\n- 4 things you can touch or feel\n- 3 things you can hear\n- 2 things you can smell\n- 1 thing you can taste\n\nBy focusing on your senses, you anchor yourself in the present moment and give your mind a break from the overwhelming thoughts or emotions. This technique can be particularly helpful when you're feeling anxious or stressed at work or school. What do you think about this technique, Emilio?\n\nPatient: I like the sound of that. It seems like a simple way to bring myself back to the present when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I can definitely see myself using this at work when things get stressful.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! The 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique is a great tool to have in your coping skills toolbox. Remember, the more you practice using it, the more effective it will become. I encourage you to try it out this week whenever you notice yourself feeling overwhelmed or stressed.\n\nAnother helpful distress tolerance technique is deep breathing. When we're feeling anxious or overwhelmed, our breathing often becomes shallow and rapid, which can actually increase feelings of anxiety. By focusing on taking slow, deep breaths, we can help our bodies relax and reduce the intensity of the emotions we're experiencing.\n\nOne simple deep breathing exercise is called \"square breathing\" or \"box breathing.\" It involves inhaling for a count of four, holding the breath for a count of four, exhaling for a count of four, and then holding the breath again for a count of four before repeating the cycle. This technique can help slow down your breathing and bring a sense of calm to your mind and body. What are your thoughts on this technique, Emilio?\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I've noticed that when I'm feeling anxious, my breathing does get shallow and fast. I like the idea of having a structured breathing exercise to help calm me down. I'll definitely give square breathing a try.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Emilio. Deep breathing exercises like square breathing can be very effective in managing overwhelming emotions. Remember, you can use this technique anytime, anywhere \u2013 whether you're at work, school, or home. The more you practice, the more natural it will feel.\n\nAs we continue to work on managing overwhelming emotions, it's also important to explore the thoughts and beliefs that may be contributing to these emotions. In our previous sessions, we've discussed the concept of intermediate beliefs and how they can influence our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. I'd like to spend some time now exploring any intermediate beliefs that may be related to your experiences of feeling overwhelmed and struggling to set boundaries.\n\nTherapist: Let's explore some of the intermediate beliefs that may be contributing to your feelings of overwhelm and difficulty setting boundaries. Intermediate beliefs are often in the form of \"if-then\" statements or rules that we hold about ourselves, others, or the world around us. They can influence our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in various situations.\n\nFor example, an intermediate belief related to setting boundaries might be, \"If I say no to others, then they will think I'm selfish or uncaring.\" Can you think of any intermediate beliefs that may be affecting your ability to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs?\n\nPatient: I think one belief that comes up for me is, \"If I don't help others when they ask, then I'm not a good person.\" I feel like I have to put others' needs before my own, even if it means sacrificing my own well-being.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. This belief that you need to put others' needs before your own in order to be a good person can make it very difficult to set boundaries and prioritize self-care. Let's explore this belief a bit further.\n\nCan you think of any evidence that supports this belief? Have there been times when putting others' needs first has led to positive outcomes or made you feel like a good person?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess when I help others, they often express gratitude and appreciation. That makes me feel good about myself, like I'm making a positive difference in their lives.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point. Helping others and receiving appreciation can certainly contribute to feelings of being a good person. However, it's important to recognize that you can still be a good person while also setting boundaries and taking care of yourself.\n\nLet's consider some evidence against this belief. Have there been times when putting others' needs first has led to negative consequences for you, such as feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or neglecting your own needs?\n\nPatient: Yes, there have been many times when I've taken on too much and ended up feeling burnt out and resentful. I've also neglected my own needs, like skipping meals or not getting enough sleep, because I was too busy helping others.\n\nTherapist: Those are important examples of how always putting others' needs first can have negative consequences for your own well-being. It's essential to find a balance between helping others and taking care of yourself.\n\nAnother point to consider is that setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs can actually make you a better friend, family member, or colleague. When you take care of yourself, you have more energy and resources to support others in a sustainable way.\n\nWhat do you think about reframing this belief to something like, \"I can be a good person by balancing helping others with taking care of myself. Setting boundaries allows me to support others in a sustainable way.\"\n\nPatient: I like that reframing. It makes sense that taking care of myself can actually make me a better friend and colleague in the long run. It's just hard to break the habit of always saying yes to others.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, changing long-held beliefs and patterns can be challenging. It takes practice and patience with yourself. Remember that setting boundaries is a skill that you can develop over time, and it's okay to start small.\n\nAs you continue to practice setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care, pay attention to the thoughts and emotions that come up. Use the thought records and distress tolerance techniques we've discussed to manage any overwhelming emotions and challenge unhelpful thoughts.\n\nBefore we wrap up today's session, let's discuss some homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue using thought records to track negative thoughts and identify cognitive distortions, particularly in situations where you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to set boundaries.\n\nI also encourage you to practice the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique and square breathing whenever you notice yourself feeling anxious or stressed. Remember, the more you practice these techniques, the more effective they will become.\n\nFinally, I'd like you to continue practicing setting boundaries in small ways, both at work and in your personal life. Pay attention to the thoughts and emotions that arise when you set boundaries, and use your thought records to challenge any unhelpful beliefs.\n\nWhat do you think about this homework plan, Emilio? Do you have any questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: The homework plan seems manageable. I'm definitely going to keep practicing the grounding and breathing techniques, as I think those will be helpful for managing my anxiety. Setting boundaries is still challenging, but I'll try to start small and work on challenging those unhelpful beliefs.\n\nTherapist: That sounds great, Emilio. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have setbacks along the way. The important thing is that you keep practicing and being patient with yourself.\n\nBefore we end today's session, let's do a quick check-in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also hopeful. It's helpful to have these techniques and reframed beliefs to work with. I know it won't be easy, but I'm committed to making changes and prioritizing my well-being.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling hopeful and committed to making changes. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nThank you for your hard work and openness in today's session, Emilio. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Until then, take care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Emilio's experiences with thought records and boundary-setting practice since the last session\n  - Introduced distress tolerance techniques: 5-4-3-2-1 grounding and square breathing\n  - Explored intermediate beliefs related to setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care\n  - Reframed the belief \"If I don't help others when they ask, then I'm not a good person\" to \"I can be a good person by balancing helping others with taking care of myself.
