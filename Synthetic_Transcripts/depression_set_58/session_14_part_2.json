  "transcript": "Here is Part 2 of the CBT session transcript with Emilio:\n\nPatient: One situation that comes to mind is when I got a lower grade than I expected on a recent assignment. I immediately felt overwhelmed and anxious, thinking that I'm not cut out for this program and that I'll never succeed in my career. It was hard to separate those thoughts from the intense emotions I was experiencing.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, and it's very common for thoughts and emotions to become intertwined in situations like this. Let's break it down using a thought record. Can you walk me through the situation, your emotions, and the automatic thoughts that came up?\n\nPatient: The situation was getting my assignment back with a lower grade than I hoped for. I felt really anxious, discouraged, and overwhelmed. My automatic thoughts were things like \"I'm not good enough,\" \"I'll never succeed in this program,\" and \"I'm going to disappoint everyone.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have the situation, emotions, and automatic thoughts identified. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the thought \"I'm not good enough\"?\n\nPatient: Well, the lower grade on this assignment feels like evidence that I'm not good enough. I also tend to compare myself to my classmates who seem to be doing better than me.\n\nTherapist: I see. And what about evidence against that thought? Have there been times when you've performed well or received positive feedback?\n\nPatient: When I think about it, I have had some assignments where I did well. And my professor did say that this was a particularly challenging assignment for everyone in the class. It's not like I'm always getting low grades.\n\nTherapist: That's important to recognize. It sounds like there's evidence on both sides, but the initial automatic thought might be an example of all-or-nothing thinking. Let's try to come up with an alternative thought that takes both sides into account. What might be a more balanced way to look at this situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be something like \"One lower grade doesn't define my entire academic ability. I've had successes in the past, and this is an opportunity to learn and improve.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought! It acknowledges the challenge of this particular assignment while also recognizing your past successes and the potential for growth. How does that thought feel compared to the initial automatic thought?\n\nPatient: It feels more hopeful and less overwhelming. I can see how getting stuck in that all-or-nothing thinking pattern makes me feel worse.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Challenging those automatic thoughts and finding more balanced alternatives can help shift your emotional response. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the easier it becomes to untangle thoughts and emotions. Let's keep working on this together.",
