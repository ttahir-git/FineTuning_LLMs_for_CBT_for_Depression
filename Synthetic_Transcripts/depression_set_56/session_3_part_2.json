  "transcript": "Patient: Yes, that definitely resonates with my experience. It's helpful to see how these negative thought patterns contribute to my depression and low self-esteem.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that resonates with you. Recognizing these patterns is an important first step in changing them. As we move forward with therapy, we'll work on developing skills to challenge and reframe these negative thoughts, which can help improve your mood and self-esteem over time.\n\nSpeaking of moving forward, let's discuss some specific goals for your therapy. You mentioned earlier that you'd like to work on managing your depressive symptoms and improving your self-esteem. Can you tell me more about what that might look like for you?\n\nPatient: I think one goal would be to have more control over my negative thoughts, so they don't consume me as much. I'd also like to feel more confident in my abilities at work and in my relationships.\n\nTherapist: Those are great goals! Let's break them down into smaller, more specific objectives that we can work on together. For example, one objective might be to identify and challenge at least one negative thought per day using the techniques we've discussed, like looking for evidence that contradicts the thought. Another objective could be to practice self-care activities, such as engaging in hobbies or reaching out to supportive friends, to help improve your mood and self-esteem. How do those sound to you?\n\nPatient: Those sound like good objectives. I think having specific things to work on will help me feel like I'm making progress.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Setting specific, measurable goals is an important part of CBT. It allows us to track your progress and make adjustments as needed. As we continue with therapy, we'll introduce more techniques and strategies to help you reach these goals.\n\nOne technique we'll be using is called thought recording. This involves writing down your negative thoughts, identifying the cognitive distortions, and then challenging those thoughts by looking for evidence that contradicts them. Would you like to practice this together now?\n\nPatient: Sure, that sounds helpful. How do we start?\n\nTherapist: Let's start by identifying a negative thought you've had recently. It could be something related to work, relationships, or any other area of your life. Once we have the thought, we'll work on identifying the cognitive distortion and challenging it together. Can you think of a negative thought you'd like to work with?",
