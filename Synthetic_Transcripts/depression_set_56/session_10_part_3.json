  "transcript": "Patient: It's helpful to see how challenging my thoughts can make them feel less intense. I guess I need to practice this more, so it becomes easier to do when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Jamie. Like any skill, challenging distressing thoughts takes practice. The more you do it, the more natural it will feel. I'm glad you're finding it helpful so far.\n\nSince we've been talking about work-related stress, I'm curious about your experience with the behavioral experiment we discussed last session. Do you remember the plan to initiate a conversation with a colleague and observe their response?\n\nPatient: Yes, I remember. I did try it a couple of times this past week. I asked a colleague about their weekend plans and another time, I complimented someone's work on a project. Both times, the conversations went better than I expected. My colleagues seemed friendly and receptive.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Jamie! It takes courage to step out of your comfort zone like that. What did you learn from those experiences?\n\nPatient: I guess I learned that my fears about how others perceive me might not always be accurate. Just because I feel like I'm not doing well doesn't mean others see me that way.\n\nTherapist: That's a valuable insight, Jamie. Our perceptions of ourselves can often be distorted, especially when we're feeling depressed or anxious. Engaging in behavioral experiments like this can help us gather more accurate information about how others see us and challenge some of those negative beliefs.\n\nI'd like to explore this a bit further. When you have thoughts like \"My colleagues probably think I'm not pulling my weight,\" what do you think that says about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel like I'm not good enough, like I'm a failure.\n\nTherapist: So, it taps into a deeper belief about your self-worth. This is what we call a core belief. Core beliefs are often formed early in life and can be activated by situations that feel similar to those early experiences. In our work together, we'll be identifying and challenging these core beliefs, as they can contribute to the negative thoughts and feelings you experience.\n\nLet's try an exercise called the downward arrow technique. I'll ask you a series of questions, and I want you to answer with the first thought that comes to mind. Okay?\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll try my best.\n\nTherapist: Great. So, if it's true that your colleagues think you're not pulling your weight, what does that mean about you?\n\nPatient: It means I'm not a valuable team member.\n\nTherapist: And if you're not a valuable team member, what does that mean about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It means I'm not worthy of respect or appreciation.\n\nTherapist: And if you're not worthy of respect or appreciation, what does that say about your value as a human being?\n\nPatient: It means I'm not valuable or worthy at all.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for being so open and honest, Jamie. I can see how painful that belief is for you. This is an example of a negative core belief: \"I'm not valuable or worthy as a person.\" These beliefs can color how we see ourselves and the world around us.\n\nThe good news is that core beliefs can be changed. It takes time and practice, but we can work on developing more balanced and compassionate beliefs about yourself. Would you be willing to explore this further with me?",
