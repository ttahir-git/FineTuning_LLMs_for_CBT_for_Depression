  "transcript": "Patient: I like that perspective of treating myself with the same kindness I would offer a loved one. It's a good reminder that I deserve compassion too, even if it feels unnatural at first.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. Self-compassion is a skill that takes practice, just like any other skill. The more you engage in self-compassionate thoughts and behaviors, the more natural it will start to feel over time.\n\nLet's practice applying this concept to a specific situation you've faced recently. Can you think of a time when you were particularly hard on yourself, but you would have responded differently if a friend was in the same situation?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. Last week, I forgot about a Zoom call with my church group. I felt terrible about it and kept thinking, \"I'm so irresponsible. Everyone must think I don't care about the group.\" But if a friend had missed the call, I would have thought, \"It's okay, everyone forgets things sometimes. I'm sure they didn't mean to miss it.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Jamie. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle, which illustrates the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\n\nIn this situation, your automatic thought was, \"I'm so irresponsible. Everyone must think I don't care about the group.\" How did that thought make you feel?\n\nPatient: It made me feel really guilty and anxious. I was worried that people would be upset with me or think poorly of me.\n\nTherapist: And how did those feelings influence your behavior?\n\nPatient: I avoided reaching out to the group to apologize because I felt so embarrassed. I also noticed myself being extra critical of my actions for the rest of the day, like beating myself up for small mistakes.\n\nTherapist: So, the thought \"I'm so irresponsible\" led to feelings of guilt and anxiety, which in turn influenced your behavior of avoiding the group and being self-critical. Does that sound accurate?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's exactly how it played out.\n\nTherapist: Now, let's consider the alternative thought you mentioned, the one you would have had if a friend missed the call: \"It's okay, everyone forgets things sometimes. I'm sure they didn't mean to miss it.\" How do you think that thought would have made you feel?\n\nPatient: I think I would have felt more understanding and compassionate. I might have even reached out to check on my friend and see if they were okay.\n\nTherapist: And how might that compassionate response have influenced your behavior?\n\nPatient: I probably would have been more likely to reach out to the group, apologize for missing the call, and let them know I was looking forward to the next meeting. I wouldn't have spent the rest of the day criticizing myself for small mistakes.\n\nTherapist: So, the alternative thought of \"It's okay, everyone forgets things sometimes\" could have led to feelings of understanding and compassion, which in turn could have influenced more adaptive behaviors like reaching out and apologizing. Do you see how changing the thought can impact the entire CBT triangle?\n\nPatient: Yes, I do. It's interesting to see how one thought can have such a ripple effect on my emotions and actions.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. That's the power of cognitive restructuring \u2013 by challenging and reframing negative thoughts, we can influence our feelings and behaviors in a more positive direction.\n\nAs you continue to practice self-compassion, I encourage you to use this CBT triangle framework to examine how your thoughts are impacting your feelings and behaviors. When you catch yourself being self-critical, try to pause and consider how you would respond to a friend in the same situation. Then, practice extending that same understanding and kindness to yourself.\n\nRemember, self-compassion is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. Be patient with yourself as you work on building this new habit. Every small step counts, and every moment of self-compassion is a victory.\n\nWhat do you think about continuing to practice this skill as part of your homework for the next session?",
