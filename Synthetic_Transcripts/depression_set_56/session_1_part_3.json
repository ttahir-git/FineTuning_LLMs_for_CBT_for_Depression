  "transcript": "Patient: Yes, that definitely resonates with me. I've always felt like I have to hide parts of myself or be someone I'm not in order to be accepted. It's exhausting, and it's left me feeling really alone and disconnected.\n\nTherapist: It takes a lot of emotional energy to constantly monitor and adjust yourself to fit others' expectations. That sense of having to hide or suppress parts of yourself can contribute to feelings of isolation and disconnection, which can fuel depression. I'm wondering, though, about the coping strategies you've developed to manage these challenges. You mentioned earlier that your faith and church community have been important sources of support. Can you tell me more about how you've coped with your depression over the years?\n\nPatient: Well, like I said, my church has been a big part of my coping. Going to services and being part of that community gives me a sense of purpose and connection. I also try to stay busy with hobbies like cooking and reading. I find that when I'm focused on a task or immersed in a story, I don't feel as depressed.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've found some healthy coping strategies that provide a sense of purpose and distraction from your depressive symptoms. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and connection can be really helpful in managing depression. I'm curious, though, about whether you've ever sought professional help for your depression before. Have you ever been in therapy or tried any other treatments?\n\nPatient: No, I've never been in therapy before. To be honest, I've always been a little skeptical of therapy. I grew up in a family that didn't really believe in mental health treatment. They thought you should just pray and push through it. But I've been struggling for so long, and nothing seems to be working. That's why I decided to give therapy a try.\n\nTherapist: It takes a lot of courage to seek help, especially when it goes against the beliefs and norms you grew up with. I'm glad you're open to trying therapy, even if it feels unfamiliar or uncomfortable at first. It's not uncommon for people to have mixed feelings or misconceptions about therapy, especially if they've had negative experiences with mental health treatment in the past. Can you tell me more about your expectations or concerns about starting therapy?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm worried that it won't work or that I'll be judged for my thoughts and feelings. I'm also not sure what to expect in terms of the process. How does therapy actually help with depression?\n\nTherapist: Those are really common concerns, and it's important that we address them upfront. Therapy is a collaborative process, and my role is to create a safe, non-judgmental space where you can explore your thoughts and feelings openly. We'll work together to identify patterns and beliefs that may be contributing to your depression and develop new coping strategies and perspectives. It's not about fixing you or telling you what to do, but rather empowering you with tools and insights to make changes that align with your goals and values. Does that make sense?",
