  "transcript": "Therapist: On those low days, it can feel like a heavy weight is pulling you down, making it hard to find the energy or motivation to practice self-care and self-compassion. It's important to remember that these feelings are temporary, even though they might feel all-consuming in the moment.\n\nOne strategy that can be helpful is to create a \"crisis plan\" for yourself, which is a set of steps you can take when you're feeling really low and struggling to practice your skills. This might include reaching out to a trusted friend or family member, engaging in a comforting activity like taking a warm bath or listening to soothing music, or even just getting outside for a short walk to change your environment.\n\nThe key is to have a plan in place ahead of time, so that when those low moments hit, you don't have to rely on your motivation or energy to figure out what to do. You can simply follow the steps you've already laid out for yourself.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of having a crisis plan. It takes some of the pressure off in those moments when I'm feeling really down. I can just focus on following the steps, rather than trying to talk myself into feeling better.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And as you continue to practice following your crisis plan, it will start to feel more automatic and natural, even on the tough days. Another strategy that can be helpful is to break down your self-care and self-compassion practices into smaller, more manageable steps.\n\nFor example, if the idea of doing a full thought record feels overwhelming, you might start by just noticing and labeling your emotions in the moment. Or if practicing self-compassion feels like too much, you might start by simply placing a hand on your heart and taking a few deep breaths.\n\nThe key is to start small and build up gradually, rather than putting pressure on yourself to do everything perfectly right away. Every small step counts, and over time, those small steps add up to big changes.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can see how breaking things down into smaller steps could make it feel more manageable, especially on days when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And remember, self-compassion is a practice, not a perfect. There will be days when it feels easier and days when it feels harder, and that's okay. The important thing is that you keep showing up for yourself, even when it's difficult.\n\nAnother strategy that can be helpful is to enlist the support of others in your self-care and self-compassion practices. This might mean reaching out to a trusted friend or family member and asking them to remind you of your self-compassionate phrases, or even just to check in on you on the days when you're struggling.\n\nHaving that external support and accountability can be really powerful, especially when your inner critic is being particularly loud. It's a reminder that you're not alone in this journey, and that there are people who care about you and want to support you.\n\nPatient: I'm lucky to have a few close friends who I know would be happy to support me in this way. It's just hard sometimes to reach out and ask for help.\n\nTherapist: Asking for help can be really vulnerable, especially if you're used to being independent and self-reliant. But reaching out for support is actually a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes courage to be honest about your struggles and to allow others to be there for you.\n\nOne way to make it easier to reach out for support might be to have a pre-written text or email that you can send to your trusted friends or family members on the days when you're struggling. That way, you don't have to come up with the words in the moment, you can simply send the message you've already prepared.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I could even include some of my self-compassionate phrases in the message, so they know exactly how to support me.\n\nTherapist: That's a great way to set yourself up for success. And remember, your friends and family members care about you and want to support you, even if they don't always know exactly what to say or do. Simply knowing that they're there for you can be a powerful reminder that you're not alone in this journey.\n\nAs we continue to work on building your self-compassion practice, it can also be helpful to explore the roots of your inner critic. Often, our inner critic develops as a way to protect ourselves from pain or rejection, even though it ultimately ends up causing us more harm than good.\n\nBy understanding where your inner critic comes from and what function it's trying to serve, you can start to have more compassion for that part of yourself, even as you work to challenge and reframe those negative thoughts.",
