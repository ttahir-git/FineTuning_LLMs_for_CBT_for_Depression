  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me, Nova. I think focusing on my automatic thoughts related to work stress and others' perceptions would be really helpful. I'm also interested in discussing strategies for managing overwhelming moments, as I've been struggling with that a lot lately.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad the agenda resonates with you, Jamie. Let's start by exploring some of the automatic thoughts you mentioned earlier. Can you think of a specific situation at work recently where you found yourself having thoughts like \"I'm not good enough\" or \"Everyone thinks I'm incompetent\"?\n\nPatient: Yes, just last week I was working on a project with a tight deadline. I felt like I was struggling to keep up and make progress. I kept thinking to myself, \"I should be able to handle this better\" and \"My colleagues probably think I'm not pulling my weight.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Jamie. I can understand how those thoughts would be distressing and contribute to feelings of overwhelm. Let's take a closer look at these thoughts using a thought record. First, can you tell me what emotions you were experiencing in that situation and how intense they were on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I was feeling really anxious, probably around an 80. I also felt sad and frustrated with myself, maybe around a 60.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so anxiety at an 80 and sadness and frustration around 60. Now, let's identify the most prominent automatic thought in that situation. It sounds like \"I should be able to handle this better\" and \"My colleagues probably think I'm not pulling my weight\" were the loudest thoughts. Which one stands out to you as the most distressing?\n\nPatient: I think \"My colleagues probably think I'm not pulling my weight\" was the most distressing. It made me feel like I was letting everyone down.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why that thought would be so distressing, Jamie. It taps into fears of being judged and not meeting others' expectations. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your colleagues think you're not pulling your weight?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I don't have any direct evidence. No one has said anything to me about it. But I feel like they must be thinking that because I'm not making as much progress as I'd like on the project.\n\nTherapist: So, the main evidence you have is your own perception of your progress on the project. Let's consider that for a moment. Is it possible that your standards for yourself are higher than what others expect of you?\n\nPatient: I suppose that's possible. I do tend to be pretty hard on myself when it comes to work.\n\nTherapist: That's a good insight, Jamie. Perfectionism and setting unrealistically high standards for ourselves can often fuel thoughts like \"I'm not good enough\" or \"Others are judging me.\" Now, let's look at the evidence against the thought that your colleagues think you're not pulling your weight. Have you received any positive feedback from colleagues or supervisors recently?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. My supervisor complimented my work on a different project just last month. And one of my colleagues thanked me for helping them with a task a few weeks ago.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that your colleagues think you're not pulling your weight, Jamie. It sounds like you have received positive feedback and appreciation from others at work. What do you make of that?\n\nPatient: I guess it shows that not everyone thinks poorly of my work. It's hard to remember those positive moments when I'm feeling overwhelmed, though.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience, Jamie. When we're feeling anxious or distressed, it's easy to focus on the negative and discount the positive. That's why it can be helpful to intentionally look for evidence that contradicts our negative thoughts, like we just did with the thought record. How are you feeling now about the thought that your colleagues think you're not pulling your weight?\n\nPatient: It feels a bit less intense now. Maybe more like a 50 instead of an 80.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, Jamie. It shows that by examining the evidence for and against our thoughts, we can start to develop a more balanced perspective. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to challenge distressing thoughts in the moment.",
