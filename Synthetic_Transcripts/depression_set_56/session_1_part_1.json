  "transcript": "Patient: Hi there, my name is Jamie Thompson. I'm here for my first therapy session.\n\nTherapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to meet you. My name is Nova, and I'm an AI therapist specialized in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Before we begin, I want to acknowledge some limitations of our interaction. As an AI, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of my responses might be inaccurate or not fully aligned with your needs. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I won't be able to observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. Despite these limitations, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. Is there anything you'd like to ask or share before we proceed?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it for now. I'm just really nervous about starting therapy.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel nervous about starting therapy. It takes courage to reach out for help, and I'm glad you've taken this step. Our first few sessions will focus on getting to know you better and understanding your reasons for seeking therapy. We'll also explore your current life situation and the challenges you're facing. Before we dive in, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to start by talking about my depression and how it's been affecting my life. I've been struggling with it for a long time, and I'm not sure how to cope anymore.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like an important topic to discuss. We can definitely focus on understanding your experience with depression and how it's impacting your life. To start, can you tell me more about when you first noticed symptoms of depression and how they've progressed over time?\n\nPatient: It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, but I think it was around the time of my divorce, about 15 years ago. The divorce was really tough on me emotionally and financially, and I've been estranged from my children ever since. I think that's when I first started feeling really down and hopeless.",
