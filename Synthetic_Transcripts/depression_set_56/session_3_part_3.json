  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, that sounds helpful. How do we start?\n\nTherapist: Let's start by identifying a negative thought you've had recently. It could be something related to work, relationships, or any other area of your life. Once we have the thought, we'll work on identifying the cognitive distortion and challenging it together. Can you think of a negative thought you'd like to work with?\n\nPatient: Well, just the other day at work, I made a small mistake on a project, and I immediately thought to myself, \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to work with. Let's start by identifying the cognitive distortion in that thought. Based on what we've discussed previously, what distortion do you think might be at play here?\n\nPatient: I think this is an example of all-or-nothing thinking. I'm seeing things in black and white terms, rather than acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! You've correctly identified the cognitive distortion as all-or-nothing thinking. Now, let's work on challenging this thought. What evidence can you think of that contradicts the idea that you're a failure and can't do anything right?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been at my job for over 25 years, so I must be doing something right. And I've received positive feedback from my colleagues and supervisors in the past.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic evidence to contradict the negative thought! You have a long history of success at your job, and you've received positive feedback from others. This helps to paint a more balanced, realistic picture of your performance, rather than the all-or-nothing view that you're a failure. How does it feel to challenge the negative thought in this way?\n\nPatient: It feels good to recognize that there's evidence against the negative thought. It helps me see that the thought isn't entirely accurate or fair.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. Challenging negative thoughts can be powerful in shifting our perspective and improving our mood. As we continue with therapy, we'll practice this skill more and more, so it becomes easier to catch and reframe negative thoughts as they occur.\n\nNow that we've practiced thought recording together, let's revisit our discussion about therapy goals. We talked about setting objectives related to managing negative thoughts and improving self-esteem. Do you feel like the thought recording technique aligns with those goals?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think thought recording will be really helpful for me in reaching those goals. It gives me a concrete way to work on changing my negative thought patterns.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Thought recording is a key technique in CBT for depression, and it can be very effective in helping to shift negative thought patterns and improve mood. As we continue with therapy, we'll also introduce other techniques, such as behavioral activation and problem-solving, to help you reach your goals.\n\nSpeaking of continuing with therapy, I want to make sure we address any concerns or questions you might have about the therapy process. Is there anything you'd like to discuss or clarify before we move forward?",
