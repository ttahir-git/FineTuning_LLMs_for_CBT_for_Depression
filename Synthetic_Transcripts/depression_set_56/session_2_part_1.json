  "transcript": "Therapist: Welcome back, Jamie. It's good to see you again. Before we dive into our session, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How are you feeling about our session today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more at ease now that I know what to expect. I did the homework you assigned, keeping a thought record. It was interesting to see my thoughts written down like that.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more comfortable and that you completed the homework. That's a great start! Before we review your thought record, let's set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to spend some time discussing the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors within the CBT framework. We can also explore some of the thought patterns you noticed in your homework. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm curious to learn more about how my thoughts might be affecting my depression.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your thought record. Can you share some of the situations, emotions, and thoughts you wrote down over the past week?\n\nPatient: Sure. One situation that stood out to me was when I was at work, and my boss gave me some critical feedback on a project. I immediately felt really down and started thinking things like, \"I'm not good enough,\" \"I'll never be successful,\" and \"Everyone thinks I'm a failure.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. I can imagine how difficult it must have been to receive critical feedback and have those negative thoughts. This is a great example of how our thoughts can influence our emotions. In this case, your thoughts about not being good enough and being a failure led to feelings of sadness and depression. Does this connection make sense to you?",
