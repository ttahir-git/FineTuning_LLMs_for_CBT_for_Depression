  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that comes to mind is when I was trying to cook a new recipe the other night. I ended up burning the dish and having to order takeout instead. My first thought was \"I can't even cook a simple meal right, I'm so incompetent.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to work with. Let's start by identifying the different components of that experience, using the CBT triangle framework. The situation was trying a new recipe and burning the dish. The emotion you experienced was likely frustration or disappointment, perhaps even shame. And the automatic thought was \"I can't even cook a simple meal right, I'm so incompetent.\"\n\nDoes that sound accurate? Can you rate the intensity of the emotion you felt in that moment, on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds about right. I'd say the intensity of the emotion was around 80. I felt really frustrated with myself and embarrassed, even though I was alone.\n\nTherapist: I can understand how that experience would bring up strong emotions and self-critical thoughts. Now, let's take a closer look at the automatic thought \"I can't even cook a simple meal right, I'm so incompetent.\"\n\nWhat would you say is the evidence that supports this thought? And what is the evidence against it?\n\nPatient: Well, the evidence for it is that I did burn the dish, even though I was following the recipe. But the evidence against it is that I've successfully cooked many meals before. One burnt dish doesn't necessarily mean I'm incompetent in the kitchen.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you're able to recognize evidence on both sides. It's true that burning the dish could be seen as evidence of incompetence in that moment. But you're also right that one mistake doesn't define your overall competence in the kitchen.\n\nLet's think about this from a more balanced perspective. How could you reframe that original thought in a way that acknowledges the mistake, but doesn't make a global judgment about your competence?\n\nPatient: I guess I could say something like \"I made a mistake with this recipe, but that doesn't mean I'm incompetent overall. Everyone burns a dish now and then.\"\n\nTherapist: I really like that reframe. It acknowledges the mistake, but doesn't overgeneralize it to your entire sense of self. It also normalizes the experience, recognizing that everyone makes mistakes in the kitchen sometimes.\n\nNow, let's check back in with your emotions. After reframing the thought, how intense does the frustration and embarrassment feel now, on that 0-100 scale?\n\nPatient: It feels less intense, maybe around a 40 now. I still feel a bit frustrated, but it doesn't feel as all-consuming as it did before.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in intensity! This is a great example of how reframing our thoughts can have a real impact on our emotional experience.\n\nAs we continue practicing this skill, it will start to become more automatic. The goal is to get to a point where you can catch those self-critical thoughts in the moment and reframe them right away, before they have a chance to really take hold emotionally.\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be really helpful. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable. It takes a lot of practice to build that mental muscle of catching and reframing thoughts. One thing that can help is to set aside a few minutes each day to intentionally practice this skill.\n\nYou could even make it a little ritual, like doing a thought record every evening before bed. Over time, that regular practice will help make the skill more automatic and accessible in the moment.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I could set aside some time each evening to review my day and practice reframing any self-critical thoughts that came up.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic plan! You could even keep a little notebook by your bed, to make it easy to jot down your thoughts and reframes.\n\nAs you continue practicing, you'll likely start to notice patterns in your thinking. Certain situations or experiences might tend to trigger self-critical thoughts more than others.\n\nNoticing those patterns can help you be more prepared to catch and reframe the thoughts when they come up. It's like having a little mental map of your common thought traps.\n\nPatient: I can definitely see some patterns already, like being more self-critical when I'm trying something new or when I'm feeling stressed.\n\nTherapist: Those are really common triggers for self-critical thoughts. Noticing those patterns is a great first step in being able to catch and reframe the thoughts more quickly.\n\nAnother helpful technique can be to come up with some general self-compassionate phrases that you can use in those situations. For example, when you're trying something new, you could remind yourself \"It's okay to make mistakes when I'm learning. That's part of the process.\"\n\nHaving those go-to phrases can help shift your perspective more quickly in the moment. We can work together to come up with some phrases that feel authentic and helpful to you.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's like having a little self-compassion toolkit ready for when I need it.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Building up that self-compassion toolkit can make a big difference in managing self-critical thoughts and the emotions that come with them.\n\nAs we wrap up today, I'd love to hear about how you're feeling now. What are some of your main takeaways from our session today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful. It's good to know that there are techniques I can use to manage the self-critical thoughts, even if it takes some practice.\n\nI think my main takeaway is that I need to be more intentional about practicing these skills, like setting aside time each day to do thought records and building up my self-compassion toolkit.\n\nTherapist: Those are great takeaways! Being intentional about practice is key in making these skills more automatic and accessible.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the cognitive restructuring and self-compassion techniques we've been working on. Try setting aside some time each day to do a thought record, and start building up your self-compassion toolkit with some go-to phrases.\n\nWe can review your progress and any challenges that come up next session. I'm also happy to brainstorm more self-care ideas and discuss any other topics that feel relevant to you.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll definitely prioritize the daily thought records and self-compassion practice. And I'd love to brainstorm more self-care ideas next session.\n\nTherapist: Great, I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress and exploring more self-care ideas together.\n\nBefore we wrap up, let me just check in one more time about how you're feeling. Do you feel like you have a clear plan for practicing these skills this week? And is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end today's session?\n\nPatient: I feel pretty clear on the plan for this week. I'm sure some challenges will come up, but I feel more equipped to handle them now.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to discuss today. I appreciate you taking the time to work through that example with me and help me come up with a plan.\n\nTherapist: It's been my pleasure. I'm really proud of the progress you're making and the effort you're putting into practicing these skills.\n\nRemember, it's okay if it feels challenging at times. That's a natural part of the process. What matters is that you keep showing up for yourself and doing your best.\n\nIf any urgent concerns come up before our next session, please don't hesitate to reach out for support. Otherwise, I look forward to hearing about your progress next week!\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate the encouragement and support. I'll definitely reach out if anything urgent comes up. Otherwise, I'll see you next week!\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed and practiced cognitive restructuring technique using a recent example of a self-critical thought\n  - Discussed the importance of regular practice in making cognitive restructuring and self-compassion skills more automatic and accessible\n  - Explored patterns in self-critical thoughts and how noticing those patterns can help with catching and reframing thoughts more quickly\n  - Introduced the idea of building a self-compassion toolkit with go-to phrases for common triggering situations\n  - Checked in on patient's current mood and provided encouragement and support\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Cognitive restructuring: Practiced identifying and reframing a self-critical thought using the CBT triangle framework.
