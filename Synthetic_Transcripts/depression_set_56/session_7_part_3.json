  "transcript": "Patient: Starting small and building up gradually feels a lot more manageable. I think I've been putting too much pressure on myself to do everything at once, and then I end up feeling overwhelmed and not doing anything at all.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common experience, Jamie. It's great that you're recognizing that pattern and considering a different approach. Starting small and building up gradually can help you build momentum and confidence without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nLet's look at your activity schedule for the coming week and see if we can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Do you have your schedule with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I have it here. I was planning to go grocery shopping on Monday, but that feels like a big task.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's break that down into smaller steps. What are the individual tasks involved in going grocery shopping?\n\nPatient: Well, first I need to make a list of what I need to buy. Then I need to drive to the store, do the actual shopping, and then drive back home and put everything away.\n\nTherapist: Great, so those are the main steps. Now let's break those down even further. For making the list, what are the smaller steps involved?\n\nPatient: I guess I need to look in my fridge and pantry to see what I already have, think about what meals I want to make for the week, and then write down the ingredients I need.\n\nTherapist: Perfect. So the steps for making the list might be:\n\n1. Check the fridge and pantry\n2. Plan meals for the week\n3. Write down needed ingredients\n\nAnd you can use positive self-talk to encourage yourself at each step, like \"I can handle this one small task\" or \"Planning ahead will make the shopping trip easier.\"\n\nHow does breaking it down like that feel?\n\nPatient: It feels a lot more manageable when I think about it that way. I can focus on one small step at a time instead of getting overwhelmed by the whole thing.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And you can apply that same approach to the other steps of the shopping trip, like driving to the store and putting the groceries away. Breaking it down into smaller pieces and using positive self-talk can make it feel more doable.\n\nAs you go through this process, it can be helpful to notice how each step feels and how it impacts your mood. That way, you can start to see the connection between your actions and your emotions.\n\nFor example, you might notice that the process of making the list feels satisfying because you're being organized and planning ahead. Or you might find that the act of driving to the store feels empowering because you're taking charge of your errands.\n\nNoticing those connections can help reinforce the benefits of engaging in activities, even when it feels challenging at first. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be helpful. I've been so focused on how hard everything feels that I haven't really paid attention to the positive aspects of doing these activities. I'll try to be more mindful of that this week.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Jamie. Being mindful of the connections between your actions and your emotions can be really powerful in shifting your perspective and motivation.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that it's okay to adjust your schedule as needed. If you find that a particular activity is feeling too challenging or overwhelming, it's okay to break it down further or even set it aside and focus on a different activity instead.\n\nThe goal is to find a balance between challenging yourself and being compassionate with yourself. It's not about being perfect or doing everything flawlessly. It's about making small, consistent efforts to engage in your life in a meaningful way.\n\nWhat do you think about that approach?",
