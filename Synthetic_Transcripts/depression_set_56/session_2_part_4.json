  "transcript": "Therapist: As we're nearing the end of our session today, I'd like to take a moment to review the main points we've discussed. We explored the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in the context of CBT, and we identified some common cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking and overgeneralization. We also discussed the importance of setting goals for our work together, and you expressed interest in focusing on improving self-esteem and developing healthier coping strategies. Does this summary capture the key points from our session today?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds about right. It's a lot to take in, but I feel like I'm starting to understand how my thoughts are affecting my mood.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Jamie. Before we wrap up, I'd like to assign a small homework task related to thought monitoring. This week, I'd like you to continue keeping a thought record, but with a focus on identifying any cognitive distortions you notice. When you write down your thoughts, see if you can label them as all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, or any other distortions we discussed today. How does that feel for you?\n\nPatient: I think I can handle that. It'll be good practice for me to start recognizing these patterns.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Jamie. Remember, the goal is not to judge or criticize yourself for having these thoughts, but simply to build awareness. If you find yourself getting stuck or feeling overwhelmed, feel free to bring those experiences back to our next session so we can problem-solve together.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Thank you for your support and guidance today.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Jamie. I'm here to support you every step of the way.
