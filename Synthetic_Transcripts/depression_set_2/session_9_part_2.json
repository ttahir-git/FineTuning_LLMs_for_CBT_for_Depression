  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by taking a closer look at the challenges you faced with the thought records. Can you walk me through an example of a situation where you struggled to find evidence against your negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: Sure. A few days ago, I was at work and made a small mistake on a project. My first thought was, \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right.\" When I tried to challenge that thought, I couldn't think of any evidence to the contrary. All I could focus on were past mistakes and the fact that I'm not where I want to be in my career.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Samir. It's common to have difficulty finding evidence against deeply ingrained negative thoughts, especially when we're feeling overwhelmed. One strategy that can be helpful is to break down the thought into smaller, more specific parts. For example, instead of focusing on the broad idea of being a failure, we could look at specific aspects of your work performance. Are there any areas where you feel more competent or have received positive feedback?\n\nPatient: I suppose I do generally complete my work on time, and my manager has commented on my attention to detail in the past. But it's hard to focus on those things when I make a mistake.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Samir. It's easier for our minds to latch onto negative experiences and discount positive ones. This is known as the negativity bias, a common cognitive distortion. By intentionally focusing on specific, positive aspects of your work performance, we can start to build a more balanced perspective. Another helpful question to ask yourself is, \"Would I judge a friend or colleague as harshly as I'm judging myself in this situation?\"\n\nPatient: Probably not. I tend to be more understanding of others' mistakes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Samir. Often, we hold ourselves to much higher standards than we would ever expect from others. Practicing self-compassion involves treating ourselves with the same kindness and understanding we would offer a friend. As we continue working on thought records, let's try to break down the thoughts into smaller parts and consider how we would respond to a friend in a similar situation. Does this approach feel manageable?\n\nPatient: It does. Breaking it down into smaller parts seems less overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Samir. Remember, challenging negative thoughts is a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself as you continue working on it. Now, let's shift our focus to the social goal you set for yourself. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and feelings that came up when you considered attending the event?",
