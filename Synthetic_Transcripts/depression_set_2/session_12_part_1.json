  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Samir, it's good to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week. I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and worry time, but I've been struggling with work stress and feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Samir. It's not uncommon to face challenges when implementing new skills. Can you tell me more about the work stress you've been experiencing and how it's been impacting you?\n\nPatient: I feel like I'm constantly behind on deadlines and not meeting expectations. It's been difficult to focus, and I find myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns, like \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I'll never be able to keep up.\"\n\nTherapist: Those negative thoughts can be really distressing and can contribute to feelings of overwhelm. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a situation at work that triggered these thoughts?\n\nPatient: Last week, I made a mistake on a project, and my supervisor pointed it out in a team meeting. I felt embarrassed and started thinking that everyone must think I'm incompetent.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a difficult situation. Let's use this example to practice the thought record technique we've been working on. Can you walk me through the different columns of the thought record, starting with the situation or trigger?\n\nPatient: The situation was my supervisor pointing out my mistake in the team meeting. The emotions I felt were embarrassment and shame, both at around an 8 out of 10 intensity. The automatic thought was \"Everyone thinks I'm incompetent.\"\n\nTherapist: Good. Now let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that everyone thinks you're incompetent?\n\nPatient: Well, my supervisor pointed out my mistake in front of the whole team, so that feels like evidence that they think I'm incompetent.\n\nTherapist: Okay, and what about evidence against that thought? Have there been times when you've received positive feedback or successfully completed projects?\n\nPatient: When I think about it, I have had successful projects in the past, and my supervisor has praised my work before. It's just hard to remember those moments when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Samir. Our negative thoughts can be so loud that they drown out the evidence that contradicts them. Let's look at alternative thoughts now. Based on the evidence for and against, what's a more balanced way to view the situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"I made a mistake, but that doesn't mean I'm incompetent. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and I've had successes in the past.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent! That's a much more balanced and realistic way of looking at the situation. How does that alternative thought impact the intensity of your emotions?\n\nPatient: When I think about it that way, the embarrassment and shame feel less intense, maybe more like a 4 out of 10.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, Samir. This is a great example of how challenging our negative thoughts can help reduce distressing emotions. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I'd like to continue practicing thought records and cognitive restructuring, especially related to work stress. I also want to discuss how to manage the overwhelm I've been feeling.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan. We can also explore how your negative thoughts might be connected to deeper beliefs about yourself and your abilities. Let's start by reviewing some of the thought records you've completed since our last session.",
