  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Samir, it's great to see you again for our 19th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. With all that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the thought records and use the coping cards we created, but it's been challenging at times. Work has been stressful, and I've been feeling more isolated lately.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you've been practicing the skills we've worked on, even though it's been difficult. It's normal to have ups and downs in the process of managing depression. Can you tell me more about the stress you've been experiencing at work and the feelings of isolation?\n\nPatient: At work, I've been feeling overwhelmed with the amount of tasks I have to complete, and I often feel like I'm not doing a good job. It's hard to stay focused and motivated. As for the isolation, I've been spending more time alone and avoiding social interactions, even with my religious community.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Samir. It sounds like we should prioritize discussing your work stress and the feelings of isolation in today's session. We can also review how the thought records and coping cards have been working for you. What do you think about setting that as our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think it would be helpful to talk about my work stress and isolation, and I'd like to discuss how I can better use the thought records and coping cards when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: Great, so our agenda for today will be:\n1. Discuss your work stress and explore ways to manage it using CBT techniques\n2. Address your feelings of isolation and brainstorm strategies to increase social connection\n3. Review your experience with thought records and coping cards, and problem-solve any challenges\nDoes this agenda cover the main points you'd like to focus on today, or is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it. Let's start with discussing my work stress.",
