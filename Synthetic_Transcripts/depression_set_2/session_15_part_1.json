  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Samir, it's great to see you again for session 15. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week, but I've been trying to apply the techniques we've discussed. I've noticed that I'm more aware of my negative thoughts and how they impact my mood. However, I still struggle with feelings of inadequacy, especially at work.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been applying the techniques and noticing your thoughts more. It's a great step towards change. Let's explore your feelings of inadequacy at work further. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I'd like to focus on my work-related stress and how it's affecting my self-esteem. I also want to discuss the Positive Data Log homework and how I can use it more effectively.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan. We can start by reviewing your experiences with the thought records and Positive Data Log homework assignments. Then, we'll explore your work-related stress and feelings of inadequacy in more depth. We'll also discuss how to make the most of the Positive Data Log to reframe your core beliefs. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds great. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Let's begin with the thought records. How did you find practicing them this past week?",
