  "transcript": "Patient: I've been struggling with feeling overwhelmed at work. I have so many tasks to complete, and I feel like I'm not doing a good job. It's hard to stay focused and motivated.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging that must be, Samir. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me about a specific situation at work that left you feeling overwhelmed and doubting your abilities?\n\nPatient: Well, last week I was working on a big project with a tight deadline. I found myself getting really stressed and anxious about it. I kept thinking, \"I'm not going to be able to finish this on time\" and \"My boss is going to be disappointed in me.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. It sounds like you were experiencing some negative automatic thoughts related to the project and your performance. Let's break this down using a thought record. First, can you describe the situation objectively, without any judgments or interpretations?\n\nPatient: The situation was that I had a big project due by the end of the week, and I had limited time to complete it.\n\nTherapist: Good. Now, what emotions did you feel in that situation, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt really anxious, maybe around 80%. I also felt overwhelmed and a bit hopeless, like I wouldn't be able to get it done.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you felt anxious at 80%, overwhelmed, and hopeless. What thoughts were going through your mind in that moment that contributed to those emotions?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I'm not going to be able to finish this on time. My boss is going to be disappointed in me. I'm going to let everyone down.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are some powerful negative thoughts. Let's look at them more closely. What evidence do you have that supports these thoughts?\n\nPatient: Well, I've struggled with meeting deadlines in the past, and my boss has expressed frustration with me before. I guess that's why I assume I'll disappoint him again.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, given your past experiences. Now, let's consider some evidence that doesn't support these negative thoughts. Have there been times when you've successfully completed projects on time?\n\nPatient: Yes, actually. Just last month, I finished a project ahead of schedule, and my boss praised my work.\n\nTherapist: That's great! So, there is evidence that contradicts your negative thoughts. You have successfully completed projects in the past. Now, let's look at the situation from a more balanced perspective. Based on the evidence, what's a more realistic and adaptive thought?\n\nPatient: I guess a more realistic thought would be, \"I've completed challenging projects before, and I have the skills to do it again. I can break the project down into smaller tasks and focus on one step at a time.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent! That's a much more balanced and helpful thought. How do you feel when you think about the situation from this perspective?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit less anxious and overwhelmed. I'd say my anxiety is more around 50% now.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant improvement. This is a great example of how challenging negative thoughts can help reduce distressing emotions. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to catch and reframe negative thoughts in the moment.",
