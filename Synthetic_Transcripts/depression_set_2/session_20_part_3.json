  "transcript": "Patient: Some evidence-based thoughts that support my ability to maintain progress are that I've been consistently practicing the skills we've discussed, like thought records and behavioral experiments, and I've seen improvements in my mood and functioning. I've also been able to challenge some of my long-held negative beliefs, like the belief that I'm a failure, and develop more compassionate beliefs about myself.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of evidence-based thoughts that support your ability to maintain progress, Samir. You've demonstrated consistency in practicing CBT skills and have made significant strides in challenging negative beliefs and developing more compassionate ones. Another piece of evidence is that you've been able to apply these skills in real-life situations, like attending the social event at your religious community center. This shows that you can take the insights and skills you've gained in therapy and apply them to your daily life.\n\nPatient: That's true. I guess I have been able to apply these skills in real-life situations, even though it's been challenging at times. It's just hard to believe in myself sometimes, especially when I'm feeling down or facing a difficult situation.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to have doubts or struggles with self-belief, especially when facing challenges. That's why it's important to have a plan in place for managing difficult situations and emotions. One strategy we've discussed is creating coping cards with reminders of adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs. What are some other strategies you can include in your plan for maintaining progress and managing challenges?\n\nPatient: Some other strategies I can include are reaching out to my support system, like friends or people from my religious community, when I'm feeling down or struggling. I can also engage in self-care activities, like hiking or painting, to help me cope with difficult emotions. And if I start to feel really overwhelmed, I can seek professional help again, like scheduling a booster session with a therapist.\n\nTherapist: Those are all excellent strategies to include in your plan, Samir. Reaching out to your support system, engaging in self-care activities, and seeking professional help when needed are all important ways to maintain your progress and manage challenges. Another helpful tool is to create a \"wellness action plan\" that outlines specific steps you can take if you start to notice your symptoms worsening or if you face a particularly difficult situation. This can include things like reviewing your coping cards, reaching out to a specific friend or family member, or scheduling a therapy session. What are some steps you would include in your wellness action plan?\n\nPatient: In my wellness action plan, I would include reviewing my coping cards daily, even when I'm feeling good, to remind myself of the progress I've made and the skills I've learned. I would also include reaching out to my friend Ali from my religious community if I'm feeling down or struggling, since he's been supportive in the past. And if I notice my symptoms worsening or if I'm facing a particularly difficult situation, I would schedule a booster session with a therapist to get some extra support.\n\nTherapist: Those are great steps to include in your wellness action plan, Samir. Reviewing your coping cards daily, reaching out to supportive friends like Ali, and scheduling booster sessions with a therapist when needed are all proactive ways to maintain your progress and manage challenges. Another important aspect of your plan is to continue practicing the CBT skills we've discussed, like thought records and behavioral experiments, even when you're feeling good. This can help reinforce the progress you've made and prevent setbacks.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll definitely continue practicing the CBT skills we've discussed, even when I'm feeling good. It's just hard sometimes to motivate myself to do the work when I'm not in crisis mode.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to struggle with motivation at times, especially when you're not in crisis mode. That's why it's important to set realistic goals and create a routine for practicing your CBT skills. One strategy is to schedule a specific time each day or week to practice thought records or behavioral experiments, even if it's just for a short period of time. You can also set reminders on your phone or calendar to help you stay on track. What are some realistic goals you can set for practicing your CBT skills?",
