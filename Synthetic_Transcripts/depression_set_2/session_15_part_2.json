  "transcript": "Patient: Practicing the thought records has been challenging, but I'm starting to see how my thoughts influence my emotions. I've noticed that I often have thoughts like \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I'll never be successful\" when I'm at work, and these thoughts make me feel really down and unmotivated.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're noticing these patterns. Recognizing the connection between your thoughts and emotions is a crucial step in CBT. Let's look at a specific situation from your thought record where you felt inadequate at work. Can you walk me through it?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I made a mistake on a report I submitted to my supervisor. I immediately started thinking, \"I'm such a failure. I can't even get a simple report right. My supervisor must think I'm incompetent.\" I felt really anxious and ashamed.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that. Let's examine this situation using the thought record. What emotions did you feel, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt anxious at about 80% and ashamed at around 90%.\n\nTherapist: Okay, now let's identify the automatic thought that stood out the most. It seems like \"I'm such a failure\" and \"My supervisor must think I'm incompetent\" were the most prominent. Is that right?\n\nPatient: Yes, those thoughts were the strongest.\n\nTherapist: Let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're a failure or that your supervisor thinks you're incompetent?\n\nPatient: Well, I made a mistake on the report, and my supervisor pointed it out. That's evidence that I failed in that task.\n\nTherapist: I see. Now, let's consider the evidence against these thoughts. Have you received any positive feedback from your supervisor or colleagues recently?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. Just last month, my supervisor praised me for my attention to detail on another project. And my colleagues often come to me for help with their work.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're a failure or incompetent. Let's generate an alternative thought based on this evidence. What's a more balanced way to view this situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. One mistake doesn't define my entire work performance or my worth as an employee.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought! It acknowledges the mistake but doesn't overgeneralize it to your entire self-worth. How do you feel when you consider this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: When I think about it that way, my anxiety and shame decrease. I'd say my anxiety is now around 40%, and my shame is about 50%.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in the intensity of your emotions. This shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing how we feel. With practice, generating alternative thoughts will become easier and more automatic.\n\nPatient: I can see how this could be helpful. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge. It takes time and practice to make this a habit. One way to make it easier is to schedule a specific time each day to review your thoughts and emotions. This can be during your worry time or at another designated time. The more you practice, the more natural it will become.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to set aside some time each day to work on this.\n\nTherapist: Great! Now, let's discuss the Positive Data Log homework. How did you find that exercise?\n\nPatient: It was challenging to come up with evidence that supports the new core belief \"I am capable and worthy, even when I make mistakes.\" I'm so used to focusing on my flaws and mistakes that it's hard to see the positive aspects of myself.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. It takes time to shift our focus and start recognizing our strengths and accomplishments. Let's brainstorm some examples of evidence that support this new core belief.",
