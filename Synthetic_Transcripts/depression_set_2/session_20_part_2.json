  "transcript": "Patient: One example of self-efficacy is when I decided to attend a social event at my religious community center, even though I was nervous about it. I remembered the behavioral experiments we had discussed and decided to test out my belief that people would judge me or think I don't belong. I ended up having a good conversation with someone and realized that people were more accepting than I initially thought.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of self-efficacy, Samir. You took a risk and challenged your negative beliefs by attending the social event, even though it was uncomfortable. This shows that you have the ability to apply CBT skills independently and make progress towards your goals. Another important aspect of maintaining your progress is planning for potential setbacks and challenges. Have you thought about how you might cope with difficult situations or emotions after our sessions end?\n\nPatient: I know that I'll still face challenges after therapy ends, so I've been trying to come up with a plan. One thing I want to do is continue practicing the skills we've discussed, like thought records and behavioral experiments. I also want to make sure I have a support system in place, whether that's reaching out to friends or attending support groups. And if I start to feel really overwhelmed, I know that I can always seek professional help again.\n\nTherapist: Those are all great strategies for maintaining your progress and coping with challenges. It's important to have a plan in place and to remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Another helpful tool is creating coping cards with reminders of adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs. These can be a tangible resource to support you after therapy. What are some thoughts or beliefs that you would like to include on your coping cards?\n\nPatient: One thought I want to include is \"I am capable of learning and growing, and my worth is not defined by my job or successes.\" This has been a helpful reminder for me when I start to feel like a failure. Another belief I want to include is \"I am worthy of love and acceptance, even if my family doesn't accept me.\" This is something I still struggle with, but I'm working on believing it more.\n\nTherapist: Those are powerful and meaningful beliefs to include on your coping cards, Samir. They reflect the progress you've made in reframing negative thoughts and developing more compassionate beliefs about yourself. Another helpful exercise we can do is a meta-thought record about the experience of CBT itself and the progress you've made. This can help address any concerns or anxieties you may have about ending therapy. What are some thoughts or feelings that come up for you when you think about our sessions coming to an end?\n\nPatient: I feel a mix of emotions when I think about ending therapy. On one hand, I feel proud of the progress I've made and grateful for the skills I've learned. But on the other hand, I feel anxious about whether I'll be able to maintain my progress on my own. I worry that without the structure and support of our sessions, I might fall back into old patterns of negative thinking and isolation.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions about ending therapy, including pride, gratitude, and anxiety. Let's explore these thoughts and feelings further using a meta-thought record. What are some evidence-based thoughts that support your ability to maintain progress after therapy ends?",
