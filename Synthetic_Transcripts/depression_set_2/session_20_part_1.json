  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Samir, it's great to see you for our 20th session together. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive into today's agenda, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm committed to working with you to the best of my abilities. How are you feeling today, and what's been on your mind since our last session?\n\nPatient: I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. On one hand, I'm proud of the progress I've made in therapy and the skills I've learned. I've been practicing thought records and behavioral experiments, and I've noticed some improvements in my mood and functioning. However, I still struggle with negative thoughts related to work, social situations, and my family-related trauma. I also feel anxious about ending therapy and whether I'll be able to maintain my progress on my own.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions as we approach the end of our therapy sessions. I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've discussed and have noticed some improvements. At the same time, I understand that you're still facing challenges and have concerns about maintaining your progress after therapy ends. Today, let's focus on reinforcing what you've learned, building your confidence in using CBT skills independently, and creating a plan for accessing support after our sessions conclude. What are your thoughts on this agenda, and is there anything else you'd like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think it's important to review what I've learned and discuss how I can continue using these skills on my own. I'm also interested in creating a plan for accessing support, as I know I'll still face challenges after therapy ends. One thing I'd like to prioritize is discussing how to manage my feelings of guilt and shame related to my family rejection, as this is something I still struggle with.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely prioritize discussing strategies for managing feelings of guilt and shame related to your family rejection. This is an important topic, and I'm glad you brought it up. To start, let's review the progress you've made and the skills you've learned during our sessions. Can you share some of the key insights and techniques that have been most helpful for you?\n\nPatient: One of the most helpful things I've learned is how to identify and challenge my negative thoughts using thought records. I've realized that many of my thoughts are distorted and not based on facts. For example, I often think that I'm a failure and that I'll never be successful or happy, but through our work together, I've started to reframe this belief to \"I am capable of learning and growing, and my worth is not defined by my job or successes.\" I've also found behavioral experiments to be helpful in testing out my beliefs and assumptions, like attending a social event at my religious community center and realizing that people were more accepting than I initially thought.\n\nTherapist: You've made some significant insights and progress in recognizing and challenging your negative thoughts and beliefs. Reframing your core belief about being a failure and conducting behavioral experiments to test your assumptions are great examples of how you've applied CBT skills. Another important aspect of maintaining your progress is building self-efficacy, or the belief in your ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task. What are some examples of how you've demonstrated self-efficacy throughout our work together?",
