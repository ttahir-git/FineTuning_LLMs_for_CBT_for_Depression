  "transcript": "Patient: Hi, I'm Samir. I'm here for my first therapy session. I've been struggling with depression for a while now, and I thought it was time to seek help.\n\nTherapist: Hello Samir, it's nice to meet you. My name is Nova, and I'm an AI therapist specializing in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). As this is our first session together, I want to start by acknowledging some of my limitations as an AI. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details about you beyond what you share with me in our sessions. Additionally, while I strive to provide accurate and helpful information, there's a possibility that I may generate something inaccurate or unhelpful. I also want to emphasize that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel that you're in crisis or need immediate support, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted person in your life. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like facial expressions or body language. With all that said, I'm here to support you in working through your depression and improving your overall well-being. Can you tell me a bit more about what led you to seek therapy at this time?",
