  "transcript": "Patient: Some realistic goals I can set are practicing thought records at least once a week, even if I'm feeling good, and trying to do a behavioral experiment once a month to continue challenging my negative beliefs. I can also set a reminder on my phone to review my coping cards every day and reach out to Ali or another friend at least once a week to stay connected.\n\nTherapist: Those are great realistic goals, Samir. Practicing thought records weekly, doing a behavioral experiment monthly, reviewing your coping cards daily, and reaching out to friends regularly are all proactive steps you can take to maintain your progress and prevent setbacks. It's also important to remember that setbacks are a normal part of the recovery process and don't mean that you've failed or that your progress isn't real. If you do experience a setback, try to practice self-compassion and use your wellness action plan to get back on track.\n\nPatient: That's a good reminder. I guess I need to be prepared for setbacks and not beat myself up if they happen. I'll try to remember to use my wellness action plan and reach out for support if I need it.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Samir. Being prepared for setbacks and having a plan in place can make them feel less overwhelming and help you get back on track more quickly. As we wrap up our sessions together, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made and the hard work you've put into your recovery. You've demonstrated a strong commitment to your mental health and have made significant strides in challenging negative beliefs, developing more compassionate thoughts, and applying CBT skills in your daily life. I have confidence in your ability to continue this work independently and to use your wellness action plan and support system to maintain your progress.\n\nPatient: Thank you, that means a lot to hear you say that. I know I still have work to do, but I feel more equipped to handle challenges now than I did before starting therapy. I appreciate all of your support and guidance throughout this process.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Samir. It's been a pleasure working with you and seeing your growth over these past 20 sessions. Remember that you have the skills and resources to continue making progress and that seeking support when needed is a sign of strength, not weakness. Before we end our session, do you have any final thoughts or questions you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I don't think I have any final questions, but I just want to say thank you again for everything. I feel like I've learned a lot about myself and have made some important changes in my life because of our work together. I know it won't always be easy, but I feel more hopeful about the future now.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Samir. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful about the future. Remember that hope is a skill that you can continue to cultivate, even in the face of challenges. You have the tools and the resilience to keep moving forward, one day at a time. If you don't have any other questions or concerns, let's go ahead and wrap up our session here. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need support in the future. I wish you all the best on your continued journey of growth and healing.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I'll definitely reach out if I need support. Take care.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed the patient's progress in therapy, including the skills learned and the improvements in mood and functioning\n  - Discussed strategies for maintaining gains after therapy ends, including creating a CBT toolbox and a plan for accessing support\n  - Explored the patient's feelings about ending therapy and instilled confidence in their ability to continue using CBT skills independently\n  - Completed a meta-thought record about the experience of CBT and the progress made\n  - Developed a wellness action plan for managing potential setbacks and challenges\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Reviewed the patient's progress and challenges, and practiced challenging negative thoughts related to work, social situations, and family-related trauma\n  - Behavioral experiments: Discussed the patient's experience attending a social event at their religious community center and the insights gained from the experiment\n  - Coping cards: Created cards with self-compassionate thoughts to challenge feelings of guilt and shame related to family rejection\n  - Self-care activities: Encouraged the patient to continue engaging in activities that bring joy and connection, like hiking and attending community events\n  - Mindfulness and deep breathing exercises (from previous sessions)\n  - Behavioral activation (from previous sessions)\n  - Positive Data Log (from previous sessions)\n  - Worry time (from previous sessions)\n  - Meta-thought record: Completed a thought record about the experience of CBT and the progress made\n  - Wellness action plan: Developed a plan for managing potential setbacks and challenges, including reviewing coping cards, reaching out for support, and scheduling booster sessions with a therapist\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Create a personalized CBT toolbox with key skills and strategies learned in therapy, such as thought records, behavioral experiments, self-compassion, and mindfulness exercises\n  - Develop a plan for accessing support after therapy ends, including reaching out to friends, attending support groups, and scheduling booster sessions with a therapist\n  - Practice thought records at least once a week, even when feeling good\n  - Conduct a behavioral experiment once a month to continue challenging negative beliefs\n  - Review coping cards daily and reach out to a friend at least once a week to stay connected\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details:\n  - The patient reported feeling proud of their progress in therapy and more confident about managing their depression after therapy ends\n  - The patient demonstrated progress in practicing thought records, conducting behavioral experiments, and engaging in self-care activities\n  - The patient expressed ongoing challenges with negative thoughts related to work, social situations, and family-related trauma, as well as feelings of guilt and shame\n  - The patient's depression symptoms appear to be gradually improving, but they still experience periods of low mood and negative thinking\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Continued working on reframing the core belief \"I'm a failure, and I'll never be successful or happy\" to \"I am capable of learning and growing, and my worth is not defined by my job or successes\"\n  - Explored intermediate beliefs related to social situations, such as \"If I'm quiet or awkward, people will judge me and think I don't belong\"\n  - Introduced the concept of self-compassion to challenge feelings of guilt and shame related to family rejection\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - The patient's progress in practicing thought records, conducting behavioral experiments, and engaging in self-care activities\n  - The patient's experiences with and reactions to the homework assignments\n  - The patient's specific challenges and goals related to work stress, social isolation, family-related trauma, and self-compassion\n  - The plan for the patient to create a CBT toolbox and support plan for after therapy ends\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - As this was the final scheduled session, the patient was encouraged to continue practicing CBT skills independently and to use their wellness action plan and support system to maintain progress\n  - The patient was reminded that they can schedule booster sessions with a therapist if needed for additional support in the future",
