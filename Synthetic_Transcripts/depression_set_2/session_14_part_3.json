  "transcript": "Patient: Work has been really stressful lately. I feel like I'm constantly behind and not meeting expectations. My boss has been critical of my work, and it's making me doubt myself even more.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like work stress is really impacting your self-esteem and emotional well-being. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a recent situation at work that triggered these feelings of inadequacy?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I was working on a project, and I made a mistake in the data entry. My boss called me out on it in front of the whole team during a meeting. I felt so embarrassed and ashamed.\n\nTherapist: That must have been a difficult experience. Let's break this down using a thought record. What emotions did you feel in that moment, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt embarrassed, ashamed, and like a failure. I'd say the intensity was around 85 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: Okay, and what automatic thoughts went through your mind when your boss called you out?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I'm such an idiot. I can't do anything right. Everyone thinks I'm incompetent.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are some strong negative thoughts. Let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're incompetent?\n\nPatient: Well, I made that mistake, and my boss called me out on it. That's pretty clear evidence, isn't it?\n\nTherapist: I can see how that experience would make you feel that way. However, one mistake doesn't necessarily mean you're incompetent overall. Let's look at the evidence against this thought. Have there been times when you've performed well at work or received positive feedback?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been times when I've done good work. I did receive a positive performance review a few months ago, and I've successfully completed other projects in the past.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're incompetent. It shows that you have the ability to perform well and contribute to your team. Now, let's look for an alternative thought that's more balanced and based on the evidence. What's another way to view this situation?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could view it as \"I made a mistake, but everyone makes mistakes sometimes. One mistake doesn't define my entire work performance.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic thought. How does that thought make you feel compared to the original thought?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel a bit better. I still feel embarrassed about the mistake, but I don't feel as much like a complete failure.\n\nTherapist: That's good to hear. Let's rate the intensity of your emotions again with this alternative thought in mind. How intense are the feelings of embarrassment and shame now on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I'd say they're more like 60 out of 100 now.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant decrease in intensity. This shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing our emotions. By examining the evidence and finding a more balanced thought, you were able to reduce the intensity of your negative emotions.\n\nPatient: I can see that. It's just hard to remember to do this in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. It takes practice to apply these skills in the moment. One technique that can be helpful is to set aside a few minutes each day to practice thought records on past situations. This can help build the skill so it becomes more automatic over time. Would you be willing to try that as homework this week?",
