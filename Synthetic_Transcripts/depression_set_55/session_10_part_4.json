  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great strides in challenging your negative thoughts and beliefs around productivity and self-care. As we wrap up today's session, I want to emphasize the importance of continuing to practice these skills regularly. The more you engage in reframing your thoughts and prioritizing self-care, the more natural it will become over time.\n\nPatient: I understand. It's a process, and I need to be patient with myself. I'm committed to keeping up with the thought records and scheduling self-care into my daily routine.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic to hear, Noor. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there may be days when it feels more challenging. On those days, be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories. Before we end today's session, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful. It's reassuring to know that I have strategies to manage my thoughts and feelings around productivity and self-care. I know it won't be easy, but I feel more equipped to handle it now.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and equipped with strategies. Remember, you can always reach out for support if you need it. Now, let's discuss your homework for the next week. In addition to scheduling a 10-minute walk each day and practicing thought records, I'd like you to try one new self-care activity that you haven't done before. It could be something small, like trying a new hobby or calling a friend you haven't spoken to in a while. The goal is to expand your self-care repertoire.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I've been wanting to try out a new recipe, so maybe I'll do that as my new self-care activity this week.\n\nTherapist: That sounds perfect! Trying out a new recipe is a great way to practice self-care while also engaging in an activity you enjoy. Remember to be mindful during the process and take note of how it makes you feel. We can discuss your experience in our next session.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely try the new recipe and pay attention to how it feels. Thank you for today's session, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Noor. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Keep up the great work, and remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself. If any challenges arise during the week, feel free to bring them to our next session. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next time.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Challenging negative thoughts and beliefs around productivity and self-care, managing guilt related to taking breaks and engaging in self-care activities.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Noor will continue practicing thought records, focusing on challenging negative thoughts related to productivity and self-care.
