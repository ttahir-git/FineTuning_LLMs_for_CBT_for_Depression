  "transcript": "Patient: Hello, my name is Noor Samir. I'm here for my first therapy session.\n\nTherapist: Welcome, Noor. It's nice to meet you. My name is Nova, and I'm an AI therapist specializing in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Before we begin, I want to acknowledge some of my limitations as an AI. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. Sometimes, I might generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. Also, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I can't observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. Despite these limitations, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. Is there anything you'd like to ask or share before we proceed?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it for now. I'm just hoping to find some ways to cope with my depression and improve my overall well-being.\n\nTherapist: I understand, and I'm here to help you work towards those goals. Our first few sessions will be focused on assessment, which means I'll be asking you questions to better understand your background, current challenges, and what you hope to achieve through therapy. This will help us create a tailored treatment plan that addresses your specific needs. Does that sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's begin by discussing what brought you to therapy. Can you tell me more about the challenges you've been facing and how they've been impacting your life?",
