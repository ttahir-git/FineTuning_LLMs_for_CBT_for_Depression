  "transcript": "Patient: I noticed that a lot of my negative thoughts are related to my work and my family's expectations. Even though I'm doing well in my career, I often feel like I'm not doing enough or that I'm disappointing my parents.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important insights, Noor. The thoughts you're describing are quite common in depression. In CBT, we call these types of thoughts \"cognitive distortions.\" Cognitive distortions are inaccurate or exaggerated thought patterns that often contribute to negative emotions. One example of a cognitive distortion is \"all-or-nothing thinking,\" where we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms. It sounds like you might be experiencing some of this when it comes to your work and family expectations. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nPatient: Well, I feel like if I'm not the best at my job or if I don't meet every expectation my family has for me, then I'm a complete failure. There's no in-between. I'm either succeeding or failing, with nothing in between.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of all-or-nothing thinking. Another cognitive distortion that might be at play here is \"disqualifying the positive,\" where we dismiss our accomplishments and focus only on our perceived failures or shortcomings. I noticed in your thought record that you mentioned getting positive feedback from a client at work, but then you wrote off that success by telling yourself it was \"just one project\" and \"not a big deal.\" Does that sound familiar?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's exactly what I do. I have a hard time accepting compliments or acknowledging my own successes. I always feel like I could have done better or that I just got lucky.\n\nTherapist: That's really common with depression. These cognitive distortions can be so automatic that we don't even realize we're doing them. But the good news is that CBT can help us learn to identify and challenge these thought patterns. One technique we might use is called \"examining the evidence.\" When you have a negative thought, like \"I'm not doing enough at work,\" we would look at the actual evidence for and against that thought. What would you say if we examined the evidence for that thought right now?\n\nPatient: I guess the evidence for that thought is that I sometimes miss deadlines or struggle to make decisions at work. But the evidence against it is that I have a lot of satisfied clients and I'm supporting myself with my business. I'm not perfect, but I am doing well overall.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Noor. You're already starting to challenge those negative thoughts by examining the evidence. As we continue with CBT, we'll practice this skill and others to help you develop more balanced and realistic thinking patterns. How are you feeling about this so far?\n\nPatient: It feels a little strange to challenge my thoughts like this, but I can see how it could be helpful. I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. Remember, these skills take practice, so be patient with yourself as you're learning. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Before we move on, do you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed so far?",
