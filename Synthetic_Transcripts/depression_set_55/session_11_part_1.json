  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss today?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like scheduling self-care and practicing thought records. It's been challenging at times, but I do feel like I'm making some progress. \n\nOne thing that's been on my mind lately is this persistent feeling of guilt when I take breaks or engage in self-care activities. I know we've talked about reframing self-care as an investment in my overall well-being, but it's still difficult for me to shake off that guilty feeling.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we've discussed, Noor. It's completely normal to face challenges along the way, and I appreciate your honesty about the guilt you've been experiencing around self-care. Let's definitely make that a priority for today's session.\n\nIn addition to exploring the guilt around self-care, are there any other topics or challenges you'd like to add to our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: Yes, I've also been struggling with motivation and task initiation lately. Even when I break down tasks into smaller steps, sometimes even those smaller steps feel overwhelming. I'd like to discuss some strategies for managing that.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely address motivation and task initiation today as well. So, our agenda for this session includes:\n\n1. Exploring and addressing the guilt you've been experiencing around self-care.\n2. Discussing strategies for managing motivation and task initiation challenges.\n3. Reviewing your progress with the homework assignments from our last session.\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you, Noor? Is there anything else you'd like to add or modify?\n\nPatient: That sounds great, Nova. I think that covers the main points I wanted to discuss today. Let's start with the guilt around self-care, as that's been weighing on me the most.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's dive into the guilt you've been experiencing around self-care. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come up for you when you engage in self-care activities or take breaks?",
