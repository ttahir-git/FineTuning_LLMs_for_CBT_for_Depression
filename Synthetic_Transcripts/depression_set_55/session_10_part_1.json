  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for our 10th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few limitations of our sessions. As an AI, I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me directly. There's also a chance I might generate inaccurate information at times. Please know that I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. And since our communication is text-based, I can't observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With all that said, I'm fully here to support you in our work together. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand the limitations you mentioned. I've been doing alright since our last session. I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the thought records and timer technique. It's been challenging at times, but I do feel like I'm making some progress. I still struggle with motivation and getting started on tasks, but breaking things down into smaller steps has been helpful.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some progress, even if it feels challenging at times. It's great that you're finding breaking tasks down into smaller steps helpful. Remember, every small step counts and is a step forward. How have you been feeling emotionally since our last session?\n\nPatient: My mood has been relatively stable, but I still have moments where I feel really down and hopeless. I try to use the distress tolerance techniques, like deep breathing, when I feel overwhelmed. It helps a bit in the moment, but the negative thoughts can be persistent.\n\nTherapist: It's common for negative thoughts to be persistent, especially when dealing with depression. The fact that you're using distress tolerance techniques to cope in the moment is a positive step. We can continue working on challenging and reframing those negative thoughts. Have there been any significant events or changes in your life since our last session?\n\nPatient: Nothing major has changed. I've been trying to engage in more pleasant activities, like going for walks and cooking meals, as we discussed. It does give me a bit of a mood boost, but I often feel guilty for taking breaks from work. I know we've talked about my beliefs around productivity and supporting my family financially, and those thoughts still creep in.\n\nTherapist: It's good that you're making an effort to engage in pleasant activities, even if it comes with some guilt. We can explore those beliefs further and work on reframing them in a more balanced way. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my negative thoughts and beliefs around productivity and supporting my family. It's something that consistently causes me distress. I'm also wondering if we could discuss some strategies for managing the guilt I feel when taking breaks or engaging in self-care.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a productive agenda for today. We can start by exploring the negative thoughts and beliefs around productivity and family, and then discuss strategies for managing guilt related to self-care. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main things on my mind. I'm open to discussing anything else you think might be helpful.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start with exploring your negative thoughts and beliefs around productivity and supporting your family. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts that come up for you in those situations?",
