  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate your encouragement and understanding. It helps to know that progress isn't always linear and that setbacks are a normal part of the process.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Noor. Setbacks are a natural part of any learning and growth process. What matters most is how we respond to those setbacks and whether we're able to learn from them. Speaking of learning, I'd like to introduce a new concept today that builds on the work we've been doing with thought records and challenging cognitive distortions. It's called a meta-thought record.\n\nPatient: A meta-thought record? What does that involve?\n\nTherapist: A meta-thought record is similar to a regular thought record, but instead of focusing on a specific situation or event, it focuses on your thoughts and beliefs about the process of therapy itself. It's a way to explore any concerns, doubts, or expectations you might have about CBT and your progress.\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. Can you give me an example of how it works?\n\nTherapist: Sure! Let's say you have the thought, \"I'm not making enough progress in therapy.\" We would start by identifying the emotions that thought brings up for you, such as frustration, disappointment, or anxiety. Then, we would look for any cognitive distortions in that thought, like all-or-nothing thinking or disqualifying the positive.\n\nPatient: I think I understand. So, we'd be applying the same principles of CBT to my thoughts about therapy itself?\n\nTherapist: Exactly! The goal is to help you develop a more balanced and realistic perspective on your progress and the therapeutic process. It can also help us identify any barriers or challenges that might be getting in the way of your progress.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I do sometimes have doubts about whether I'm doing enough or making enough progress.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Noor. Let's explore that thought a bit further. Can you tell me more about the emotions that come up when you think, \"I'm not making enough progress in therapy\"?\n\nPatient: When I have that thought, I feel frustrated with myself and disappointed. I also feel anxious about whether I'll be able to reach my goals.\n\nTherapist: Those are understandable emotions to have. Now, let's look for any cognitive distortions in that thought. Do you notice any all-or-nothing thinking or disqualifying the positive?\n\nPatient: I think there might be some all-or-nothing thinking. I tend to see progress as either all good or all bad, without much in between.\n\nTherapist: That's a great catch, Noor. All-or-nothing thinking is a common distortion, and it can make it hard to see the smaller, incremental changes that are happening. What might be a more balanced thought about your progress in therapy?\n\nPatient: A more balanced thought might be, \"I'm making progress at my own pace, and every small step counts. It's okay if I'm not where I want to be yet, as long as I keep working towards my goals.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought, Noor. It acknowledges the progress you've made while also recognizing that growth is an ongoing process. When we focus on the small steps and celebrate each one, it can help us stay motivated and engaged in the therapeutic process.\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be helpful. It's easy to get caught up in all-or-nothing thinking and lose sight of the smaller changes.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. That's why meta-thought records can be such a powerful tool. They help us step back and look at our thoughts about therapy in a more balanced and realistic way. Would you like to practice completing a meta-thought record together?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that would be really helpful. Can we use the example I just shared about feeling like I'm not making enough progress?",
