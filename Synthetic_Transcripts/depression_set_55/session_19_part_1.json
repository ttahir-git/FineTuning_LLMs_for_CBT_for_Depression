  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. However, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities within these constraints. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I've been doing alright, thanks for asking. It's been a bit of a mixed bag, with some good days and some challenging ones. I've been trying to keep up with the thought records and self-compassion practices, but it's not always easy. I did have a situation at work this week where I missed a deadline, and it triggered a lot of those familiar negative thoughts about not being good enough.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Noor. It's common to have ups and downs, and it's okay if the skills we've been working on don't feel easy or natural all the time. That's why we practice. I'd like to explore that situation at work further, but first, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize? We could discuss the work situation, review your progress with the thought records and self-compassion, or explore how your cultural and religious background may have influenced your reaction to missing the deadline. What feels most important to you?",
