  "transcript": "Patient: No, I don't have any questions right now. I'm just trying to take it all in.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable, Noor. This is a lot of new information, and it can feel overwhelming at first. Remember, we'll be working through this together, and we'll go at a pace that feels comfortable for you. I'm curious, what are your initial thoughts about setting goals for our work together? What would you like to get out of therapy?\n\nPatient: I think my main goal is to feel better overall - less sad and hopeless. I'd also like to improve my relationships and feel more connected to the people in my life. And it would be great if I could be more productive at work and not get so stuck in negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Those are all excellent goals, Noor, and they align well with what we can work on in CBT. As we continue, we'll break those larger goals down into smaller, more specific objectives. For example, we might set a goal related to challenging negative thoughts about your work performance or finding ways to increase your social connections. We'll also track your progress over time so we can see how you're doing with each goal. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I like the idea of having specific goals to work towards. It feels more manageable that way.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Setting specific, achievable goals is a key part of CBT. Another important aspect of CBT is something we call \"homework.\" Homework in therapy is different from the kind of homework you might have had in school. In CBT, homework refers to the activities and exercises you do between sessions to practice the skills we're working on. For example, I might ask you to keep a thought record, like the one you did last week, or to try out a new coping strategy when you're feeling down. The idea is that the real work of therapy happens between sessions, in your daily life. What are your thoughts about doing homework as part of therapy?\n\nPatient: I'm open to it. I know that change doesn't happen overnight, and I'll need to practice these skills outside of our sessions. I'm willing to put in the work if it means I can start feeling better.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Noor. Your willingness to engage with the homework is a really positive sign. I'll make sure to explain each homework assignment clearly and give you a chance to ask questions before you try it on your own. And remember, homework is not about being perfect or getting everything right. It's about practicing and learning, even if that means making mistakes along the way. How are you feeling about all of this so far?",
