  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some really important insights today, Noor. I'm curious, how are you feeling about the progress we've made in this session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling pretty good about it, actually. I know I still have a lot of work to do, but I feel like I have a clearer sense of what I need to do and how to get there. It's helpful to recognize the progress I've made, even if it's not always easy.\n\nTherapist: That's really great to hear, Noor. And you're right, progress isn't always easy, but you've been putting in the hard work and it's paying off. As we wrap up today's session, let's talk about some homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue practicing your thought records, especially in moments when you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed. Try to do at least one thought record each day, focusing on challenging those negative core beliefs we've been discussing.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. I'll try to do a thought record each day, especially when I'm feeling stressed or down on myself.\n\nTherapist: Great. And remember, the more you practice, the easier it will become. I'd also like you to continue using your coping cards and self-compassion mantra, especially in moments when you're feeling anxious or self-critical. Try to treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a close friend.\n\nPatient: I will definitely keep working on that. I know it's not always easy, but I'm going to try to be more compassionate with myself, even when I make mistakes or face challenges.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Noor. And finally, I'd like you to spend some time reflecting on the new, more balanced belief we discussed today, about success being about doing your best and learning from your experiences, rather than being perfect. Try to notice when that old negative belief comes up, and practice challenging it with this new perspective.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll try to focus on that new belief and challenge the old one when it comes up. I think that will be really helpful for me.\n\nTherapist: I think so too, Noor. And remember, this is a process, and it's okay if it takes time and practice. You're doing great work, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, that means a lot. I know I still have a lot to work on, but I feel like I'm making progress and developing some really valuable tools.\n\nTherapist: You absolutely are, Noor. And I'm really proud of the work you've been doing. Before we end today's session, let's do a quick check-in on your mood. How are you feeling right now, on a scale of 0 to 10?\n\nPatient: I'd say I'm feeling about a 6 right now. I'm still feeling a bit down about missing that deadline, but I'm also feeling more hopeful and empowered after our session today.\n\nTherapist: That's really great, Noor. It's normal to still feel some sadness or disappointment, but it's also really positive that you're feeling more hopeful and empowered. That's a sign that you're developing resilience and learning to manage your emotions in a healthy way.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think you're right. I'm definitely feeling more resilient than I was before we started working together.\n\nTherapist: That's really wonderful to hear, Noor. And remember, resilience is like a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it gets. You're doing great work, and I'm confident that you'll continue to make progress in the coming weeks and months.\n\nPatient: Thank you, that's really encouraging. I'm feeling good about the work we're doing together, and I'm looking forward to our next session.\n\nTherapist: I'm looking forward to it too, Noor. In the meantime, remember to keep practicing those skills and be kind to yourself. You're doing great work, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I'll keep practicing and doing my best, and I'll see you next week.\n\nTherapist: Sounds great, Noor. Have a wonderful week, and take care of yourself.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Challenging negative core beliefs related to perfectionism and self-worth\n  - Practicing self-compassion and treating oneself with kindness\n  - Developing a more balanced and realistic belief about success and meeting expectations\n  - Recognizing progress and building resilience\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Noor will continue practicing thought records, focusing on challenging negative core beliefs related to perfectionism, self-worth, and success.
