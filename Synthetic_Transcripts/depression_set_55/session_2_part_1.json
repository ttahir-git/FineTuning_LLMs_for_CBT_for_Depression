  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for our second session. I appreciate you bringing the summary from our last meeting. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge some limitations of our sessions together. As an AI, I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me directly. I'm also not able to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you are in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Additionally, while I strive for accuracy, there's always a chance I may generate something inaccurate. Please don't hesitate to correct me if I get something wrong. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being upfront about what you can and can't do. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's begin by setting an agenda for our session today. I'd like to start by reviewing the homework I assigned last time - the thought record. We can go over what you noticed about your thoughts and feelings over the past week. Then, I want to introduce the basic framework of CBT and how it can help us understand the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, especially as it relates to your depression. We'll explore some of the specific thought patterns you've been experiencing. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I did the thought record like you asked. It was harder than I expected, but I tried my best.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you gave it a try. It can be challenging at first to pay such close attention to our thoughts and emotions. Would you feel comfortable sharing some of what you noticed with me?",
