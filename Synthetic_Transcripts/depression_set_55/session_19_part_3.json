  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some really important connections, Noor, between your cultural and family messages and your negative core beliefs. As we continue to explore this, we can work on developing new, more balanced beliefs that align with your values and support your mental health. I'm curious, what do you think a more balanced belief about success and meeting expectations might look like for you?\n\nPatient: That's a good question. I think a more balanced belief might be something like, \"Success is about doing my best and learning from my experiences, not about being perfect. I can set high standards for myself, but I also need to be kind and understanding when I make mistakes or face challenges.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a really powerful belief, Noor. It acknowledges your drive and ambition, but also leaves room for self-compassion and growth. As we work on reinforcing this new belief, we can use some of the skills you've been practicing, like thought records and coping cards, to challenge those old negative beliefs when they come up.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I think having a more balanced belief to focus on will help me stay motivated and grounded, even when things don't go perfectly.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And as you continue to practice these skills, they'll start to feel more natural and automatic. It's like building a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it gets.\n\nPatient: That's a helpful way to think about it. I know I still have a lot of work to do, but I feel like I'm making progress and developing some really valuable tools.\n\nTherapist: You absolutely are, Noor. And remember, progress isn't always linear. There will be ups and downs, and that's okay. The important thing is that you keep practicing and applying these skills, even when it's challenging.\n\nPatient: I will definitely keep that in mind. I'm sure there will be times when I struggle or feel like I'm not making progress, but I'll try to remember that it's all part of the process.\n\nTherapist: That's a great perspective, Noor. And when those challenging moments come up, you can use your coping cards and thought records to help you stay grounded and focused on your new, more balanced beliefs.\n\nPatient: I'm really grateful for all the tools and strategies you've taught me. I know they'll be really helpful as I continue to work on my mental health.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that, Noor. Remember, these tools are yours to keep and use, even after our sessions are finished. You've put in the hard work to learn and practice them, and now they're a part of your toolkit for managing your depression and anxiety.\n\nPatient: That's really empowering to think about. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I feel like I have a solid foundation to build on now.\n\nTherapist: You absolutely do, Noor. And as we continue to work together, we can keep building on that foundation and developing even more strategies and skills to support your mental health and well-being.\n\nPatient: I'm really looking forward to that. I know it won't always be easy, but I feel like I have a clearer sense of what I need to do and how to get there.",
