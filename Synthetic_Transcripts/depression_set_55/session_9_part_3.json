  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's practice applying some of these strategies to a specific situation you've faced recently. Can you think of a task or situation that felt overwhelming, even when you tried to break it down into smaller steps?\n\nPatient: Yes, I can think of an example. Last week, I was supposed to work on a project for a client, but I kept putting it off because it felt like too much. Even when I tried to break it down into smaller tasks, like researching information or outlining the project, I still felt overwhelmed and ended up avoiding it altogether.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to work with. Let's start by identifying the thoughts and feelings that came up when you thought about working on this project. What was going through your mind?\n\nPatient: I kept thinking that I wasn't going to be able to do a good job, that I didn't have enough knowledge or skills to complete the project successfully. I also felt anxious and worried about disappointing my client.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts and feelings are understandable, especially given the pressure you put on yourself to meet your own high standards. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought that you weren't going to be able to do a good job. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've never worked on a project exactly like this before, so I don't have direct experience with it. I also know that the client has high expectations, and I'm worried I won't be able to meet them.\n\nTherapist: Okay, those are valid concerns. Now, let's look at the evidence against this thought. What evidence do you have that you are capable of doing a good job on this project?\n\nPatient: I have successfully completed similar projects in the past, even if they weren't exactly the same. I also have a strong skill set in the areas that are relevant to this project, like research and analysis. And I know that I'm capable of learning new things when I need to.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you can't do a good job. Now, let's try to reframe this thought in a more balanced and realistic way. Based on the evidence you just identified, what's an alternative thought that feels more accurate?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be that while I may not have direct experience with this specific type of project, I have successfully completed similar projects in the past and have the skills and ability to learn what I need to in order to do a good job.\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic thought. How does that feel compared to the original thought that you couldn't do a good job?\n\nPatient: It feels more empowering and less overwhelming. I can see how focusing on my past successes and skills could help me feel more confident in my ability to complete the project.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Reframing our thoughts in a more balanced and realistic way can have a big impact on our feelings and behaviors. Now, let's go back to the strategy of setting a timer for a short amount of time and committing to working on a small task related to the project. What's a small task you could have set a timer for?\n\nPatient: I could have set a timer for 10 minutes and committed to doing some initial research on the topic of the project.\n\nTherapist: That's a great small task to start with. And remember, the goal is not to complete the entire project in those 10 minutes, but rather to get started and make some progress. How do you think setting a timer and focusing on that small task could have helped you feel less overwhelmed?\n\nPatient: I think it could have helped me break out of the cycle of procrastination and avoidance. By committing to just 10 minutes of research, it feels less daunting than trying to tackle the entire project at once.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And once you've completed those 10 minutes, you can celebrate that small victory and decide if you want to continue working or take a break and come back to it later. The key is to focus on the process and the small steps, rather than getting overwhelmed by the bigger picture.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can see how setting a timer and breaking the project down into even smaller tasks could help me feel more in control and less overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that strategy resonates with you. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Every small step you take is a step forward, and it's okay if some days are more challenging than others. The important thing is to keep practicing these strategies and being kind and compassionate with yourself along the way.",
