  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and self-compassion. It's been challenging at times, but I do notice some small improvements in my mood and overall outlook. I'm still struggling with perfectionism and self-criticism, especially when it comes to my work and meeting family expectations.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. It's completely normal to face challenges along the way, and we can continue working on those areas where you're struggling. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my perfectionism and self-criticism, as those seem to be the biggest hurdles for me right now. I also want to discuss how my family's expectations are affecting my self-perception and beliefs.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan. We can definitely explore your perfectionism, self-criticism, and the impact of family expectations on your self-perception. To start, can you share a recent situation where you noticed these thoughts and beliefs coming up?",
