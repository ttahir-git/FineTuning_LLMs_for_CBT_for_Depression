  "transcript": "Patient: Breaking down the work project into smaller steps was helpful. I felt less overwhelmed and more focused. But I still struggled with getting started on each step. It's like I have this mental block that keeps me from taking action.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. Breaking tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps is a key part of graded task assignments, and it's encouraging that you found it helpful for reducing overwhelm. The challenge of getting started on each step is something we can explore further. When you're facing that mental block, what thoughts and feelings come up for you?\n\nPatient: When I'm trying to start a task, I often think things like, \"This is going to be too hard,\" or \"I don't have the energy for this.\" I feel anxious and overwhelmed, like the task is this big, insurmountable thing, even if it's actually pretty small.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts and feelings are really important to recognize, as they can significantly impact your motivation and behavior. It seems like you might be experiencing some cognitive distortions, such as magnification (\"This is going to be too hard\") or fortune-telling (\"I don't have the energy for this\"). Let's explore these thoughts further. When you think, \"This is going to be too hard,\" what emotions do you feel?\n\nPatient: When I think that, I feel discouraged and anxious. It's like I'm defeated before I even start.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. You've identified a clear connection between your thoughts and emotions, which is a key concept in CBT. When we feel discouraged and anxious, it's much harder to take action, even if that action could be beneficial. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought, \"This is going to be too hard.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I have evidence from the past when I've struggled with tasks and found them challenging. Like, I can remember times when I've had to push myself really hard to get something done.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. Past experiences can definitely influence our current thoughts and beliefs. Now, what evidence do you have against the thought, \"This is going to be too hard\"?\n\nPatient: I suppose the fact that I've broken the task down into smaller steps means that each step should be more manageable. And logically, I know that I've completed similar tasks before, even if they were challenging.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! That's a great point. Breaking tasks down into smaller steps is meant to make them more manageable, and your past successes with similar tasks provide evidence that you can handle challenges. Now, based on the evidence for and against the thought, how could you reframe or modify it to be more balanced and helpful?\n\nPatient: I could try thinking something like, \"This might be challenging, but I've broken it down into manageable steps, and I've succeeded at similar tasks before.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic reframe! It acknowledges the potential for challenge, but it also recognizes your ability to handle challenges and the benefits of breaking tasks down. How do you think this new thought would impact your motivation to start on each step of a task?\n\nPatient: I think it would help me feel more confident and motivated. If I remind myself that I've prepared for the challenge and that I have a track record of success, I might be more likely to push through the initial resistance and start the task.\n\nTherapist: I completely agree. This is another great example of how challenging and reframing our thoughts can lead to positive changes in our emotions and behaviors. As we continue with therapy, we'll work on building this skill of recognizing, evaluating, and reframing unhelpful thoughts related to motivation and task initiation.",
