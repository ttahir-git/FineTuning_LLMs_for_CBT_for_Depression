  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or significant events in your life?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like thought records and self-compassion. It's been challenging at times, but I do notice small improvements in my mood and overall outlook. I'm still struggling with feelings of guilt around self-care and productivity, but I'm working on reframing those thoughts.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we discussed and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. Change takes time, and it's normal to face challenges along the way. I'm glad you're bringing up the feelings of guilt around self-care and productivity, as these seem to be recurring themes for you. Let's definitely explore that further today.\n\nBefore we dive in, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize today? I think it could be helpful to review your homework, discuss your progress with the techniques, and spend some time exploring the guilt you mentioned. We can also touch on any other topics that feel important to you. What are your thoughts?",
