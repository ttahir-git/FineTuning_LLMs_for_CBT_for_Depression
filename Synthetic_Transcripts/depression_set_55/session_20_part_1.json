  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you for our 20th session today. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the skills we've discussed, like completing thought records and using my self-compassion mantra. It's been challenging at times, but I do feel like I'm making progress.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've worked on and that you're noticing some progress. Can you tell me more about how your mood has been and if you've noticed any changes in your thoughts or behaviors since we last met?\n\nPatient: My mood has been relatively stable, around a 6 out of 10. I've had some moments where I've felt more down, but I've been trying to use the coping card we created to remind myself of the new perspectives and skills we've discussed. In terms of my thoughts, I've been catching myself when I start to engage in negative self-talk and trying to reframe those thoughts in a more balanced way.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been able to maintain a relatively stable mood and that you're using the coping card to support yourself during challenging moments. Recognizing and reframing negative self-talk is a crucial skill, and it's wonderful that you're putting it into practice. Let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to review some of the thought records I've completed since our last session and get your feedback. I also want to discuss how I can continue to challenge my negative core beliefs and maintain the progress I've made after our sessions end.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. We can start by reviewing your thought records and discussing any insights or challenges that came up as you completed them. Then, we can explore strategies for continuing to challenge your negative core beliefs and maintaining your progress after our sessions end. I'd also like to spend some time creating a relapse prevention plan to help you manage any potential setbacks in the future. How does that sound?",
