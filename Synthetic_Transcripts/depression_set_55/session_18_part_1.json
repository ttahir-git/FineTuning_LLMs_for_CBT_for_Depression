  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and self-compassion, but it's been challenging at times. I find myself falling back into old patterns of negative thinking and self-criticism, especially when it comes to my work and meeting deadlines.\n\nTherapist: It's common to face challenges when implementing new skills, and it's great that you're aware of the patterns you're falling back into. Today, we can explore those challenges further and discuss strategies to help you maintain progress. Before we set our agenda, can you share a bit more about your mood and any significant experiences since our last session?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. I had a few good days where I felt more motivated and productive, but then I missed a deadline for a project, and it sent me into a spiral of negative thoughts and self-blame. I tried to use the self-compassion mantra we discussed, but it felt forced and unconvincing in the moment. I'm starting to feel like I'm not making real progress, and it's frustrating.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you've had a mix of experiences since our last session, with some positive moments and some challenges. I want to acknowledge the effort you've put into practicing the skills we've discussed, even if it doesn't always feel successful in the moment. Progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are a normal part of the process. Today, let's focus on understanding the obstacles you're facing and developing strategies to overcome them. What would you like to prioritize in our agenda for this session?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on how to make self-compassion feel more authentic and effective for me, especially in moments when I'm struggling with negative thoughts related to work and deadlines. I also want to discuss how my cultural and religious background might be influencing my perfectionism and self-criticism, as I've been reflecting on that more since our last session.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. Let's start by exploring your experiences with self-compassion and the challenges you've faced in applying it to your negative thoughts about work and deadlines. Can you share an example of a situation where you tried to use self-compassion but found it difficult to do so effectively?",
