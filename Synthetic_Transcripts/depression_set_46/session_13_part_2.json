  "transcript": "Patient: I think that covers everything I wanted to discuss today, Nova. We can start with reviewing my progress with the thought records and the modified worry time technique.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start there. Can you share with me how you've been doing with the thought records? Have you been able to identify evidence against your negative thoughts and generate alternative thoughts?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to do the thought records regularly, but it's been challenging at times. I find it easier to identify the evidence that supports my negative thoughts than to find evidence against them. And even when I do come up with alternative thoughts, it's hard to really believe them.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Robert. Our negative thoughts can be very convincing, and it takes practice to start questioning them and considering alternative perspectives. Let's look at an example from your thought records this week. Can you share a situation where you struggled to find evidence against your negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I was working on the bookshelf project, and I made a mistake with the measurements. I immediately started thinking, \"I'm useless. I can't even get this simple task right.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's break this down. What evidence did you find that supported the thought \"I'm useless\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I messed up the measurements, which seemed like clear evidence that I can't even do a simple task correctly. And then I started thinking about all the other times I've made mistakes or failed at something.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable how that mistake could trigger those negative thoughts. Now, let's try to find evidence against the thought \"I'm useless.\" What would you say to a friend who made a mistake like that? Would you tell them they're useless?\n\nPatient: No, I wouldn't. I'd probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it doesn't mean they're useless.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Robert. We often have different standards for ourselves than we do for others. Let's think about some more evidence against the thought \"I'm useless.\" Have there been times when you've successfully completed a project or task?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I have. I've built plenty of things in the past that turned out well. And I've been able to fix things around the house when they break.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent examples of evidence against the thought \"I'm useless.\" It shows that you have skills and abilities, even if you make mistakes sometimes. Now, let's try to generate an alternative thought based on this evidence. What could be a more balanced way of looking at the situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"I made a mistake, but that doesn't mean I'm useless. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and I have plenty of evidence that I'm capable of completing projects successfully.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Robert. It acknowledges the mistake but doesn't jump to the extreme conclusion that you're useless. How does that thought feel compared to the original negative thought?\n\nPatient: It feels more realistic and less harsh. But it's still hard to fully believe it.\n\nTherapist: That's okay. It takes time and practice to start believing the alternative thoughts. The more you practice generating them and looking at the evidence, the more natural it will feel over time. Let's keep working on this throughout our session today.",
