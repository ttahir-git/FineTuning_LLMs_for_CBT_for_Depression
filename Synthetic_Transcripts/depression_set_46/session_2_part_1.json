  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Robert, it's great to see you again for our second session. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last meeting. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. I'm ready to get started with today's session.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's begin by setting an agenda for today's session. I'd like to start by reviewing the homework I assigned last time - the thought record you kept over the past week. We'll identify any patterns or areas to focus on based on what you recorded. Then, I'll introduce the CBT framework and how it relates to the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We'll explore some of your specific thought patterns related to your depression. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm curious to learn more about the CBT framework and how it can help me.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Let's start by reviewing your thought record. Can you share some of the strong emotions, distressing thoughts, triggering situations, and responses you noted over the past week?",
