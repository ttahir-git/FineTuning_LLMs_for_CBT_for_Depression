  "transcript": "Patient: Using the modified worry time technique has been interesting. I've noticed that I tend to get caught up in worries throughout the day, so setting aside a specific time to focus on them has been helpful. It's not always easy to postpone the worries until the designated time, but I'm getting better at it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. The modified worry time technique can be challenging at first, as it requires consciously shifting your focus away from worries during the day. It's encouraging that you're finding it helpful, even if it's not always easy. Can you tell me more about how you've been using the thought records?\n\nPatient: The thought records have been a bit more challenging for me. I understand the concept, but sometimes I struggle to identify the evidence against my negative thoughts. It's like my mind gets stuck on the negative and has trouble seeing anything else.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge when starting to use thought records. Our negative thoughts can be very convincing, and it takes practice to start recognizing evidence against them. Let's look at an example from your thought records, if you're comfortable sharing. Was there a particular situation or thought that you found challenging to find evidence against?\n\nPatient: Yeah, there was one situation earlier this week that stands out. I was working on a project, and I made a mistake that set me back a few hours. I immediately started thinking, \"I can't do anything right. I'm useless.\" I tried to find evidence against that thought, but in the moment, it felt so true.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. It's not uncommon for our negative thoughts to feel very true, especially when we're feeling down or have made a mistake. Let's explore this together and see if we can find some evidence against the thought \"I'm useless.\" I want to acknowledge that this can be a challenging process, but it's also an important step in starting to shift those negative thought patterns.\n\nCan you think of any times in the past when you've completed a project successfully or received positive feedback on your work?\n\nPatient: Well, now that I think about it, there have been projects I've completed successfully in the past. Just last month, I finished a big project for my daughter's room, and she seemed really happy with how it turned out. And a few weeks ago, my neighbor commented on how much he liked the work I did on my front porch.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of evidence against the thought \"I'm useless.\" Even though you made a mistake on this recent project, that doesn't negate your past successes or the positive feedback you've received. It's important to remember that making mistakes is a normal part of the learning and growth process. Everyone makes mistakes at times, and it doesn't mean that you're useless.\n\nWhat do you think about reframing the thought to something like, \"Even though I made a mistake on this project, that doesn't mean I'm useless. I've had successes in the past and have received positive feedback on my work.\" How does that feel?\n\nPatient: It feels more balanced. I guess I have a tendency to focus on the negative and discount the positive. It's helpful to remind myself of those past successes and positive feedback.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Focusing on the negative and discounting the positive is a common cognitive distortion called \"disqualifying the positive.\" It's something we'll continue to work on throughout our sessions. Recognizing and challenging these distortions is a key part of the CBT process.\n\nI want to acknowledge the progress you've made in starting to identify and challenge your negative thoughts. It's not an easy process, but the fact that you're noticing your thought patterns and making efforts to reframe them is a significant step forward.\n\nGiven what we've discussed so far, I'm wondering if we could spend some time practicing cognitive restructuring with another example from your thought records. We could also explore any other challenges or insights that have come up since our last session. What do you think about focusing on that for the remainder of our time today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm realizing that I have a lot of these negative thought patterns, and I want to get better at challenging them. Let's dive into another example.",
