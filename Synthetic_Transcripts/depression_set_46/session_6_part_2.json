  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's begin with reviewing your experience with the sleep strategies we discussed last time. Can you tell me how it went implementing those techniques over the past week?\n\nPatient: Well, I tried to stick to a consistent sleep schedule like we talked about, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day. That part wasn't too bad. But when I'm lying in bed, my mind just starts racing with all these negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that. Racing thoughts can definitely make it challenging to fall asleep. Were you able to use the \"worry time\" technique we discussed, where you set aside time earlier in the day to write down your worries?\n\nPatient: I tried it a couple times, but I had trouble sticking with it. I guess I'm just not used to setting aside time to worry on purpose.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. It can feel unnatural at first to intentionally focus on worries, especially when we're used to pushing them away. What do you think got in the way of using the worry time technique consistently?\n\nPatient: I think part of it is that I feel like I should be able to handle my worries without needing to write them down. Like, I should just be able to shut them off when it's time to sleep.\n\nTherapist: It's interesting that you say that. It sounds like there might be some self-critical thoughts popping up around needing to use this technique. I want to explore that a bit more. What do you think would be the downside of needing to write down your worries?\n\nPatient: I guess it makes me feel weak, like I can't even control my own thoughts. I should be able to just tough it out and not let them bother me.\n\nTherapist: I hear you. That's a common belief, that we should be able to control our thoughts and feelings. But the reality is, our minds are complex, and trying to just push away worries often makes them louder. Using techniques like worry time isn't a sign of weakness, it's actually a sign of strength. It takes courage to face our worries head-on and be proactive in managing them.\n\nPatient: I never thought about it that way before. That it could actually be a sign of strength to write down my worries.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. It's about recognizing that our thoughts and feelings are valid, even the difficult ones. And it's okay to need support in managing them. That's what the worry time technique is - a tool to help you take control of your worries, rather than letting them control you. How do you feel about giving it another try this week, knowing that it's an act of strength, not weakness?\n\nPatient: I'm willing to give it another shot. I like the idea of taking control of my worries, instead of them controlling me.\n\nTherapist: That's great. And remember, it's a practice. It might feel awkward at first, but the more you do it, the more natural it will start to feel. I'd love to hear how it goes for you this week.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll try to stick with it and let you know how it goes.\n\nTherapist: I look forward to hearing about your experience. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about the thoughts that have been making it hard to find motivation for activities. You mentioned earlier the thought, \"What's the point? Nothing's going to change anyway.\" Let's explore that thought a bit more. Can you tell me about a specific time this past week when that thought popped up?",
