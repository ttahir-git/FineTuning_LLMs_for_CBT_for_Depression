  "transcript": "Patient: Last week, I had planned to go to the gym, but when the time came, I just couldn't make myself get out of bed. I kept thinking, \"What's the point? I'm just going to feel tired and awful anyway.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's use this situation to practice the thought record technique we've been working on. First, can you tell me what emotions you were feeling in that moment, and how intense they were on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I was feeling really hopeless, like an 80. And also frustrated with myself, maybe a 60.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you were feeling hopeless at an 80 and frustrated at a 60. Those are strong emotions. Now, let's identify the automatic thought that was driving those feelings. It sounds like the thought was, \"What's the point? I'm just going to feel tired and awful anyway.\" Is that right?\n\nPatient: Yeah, that's the main thought that kept running through my head.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's write that down in the \"Automatic Thought\" column of the thought record. Now, I want you to think about the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that there's no point in going to the gym because you'll just feel tired and awful?\n\nPatient: Well, there have been times in the past when I've pushed myself to exercise and ended up feeling even more exhausted afterwards. So that's kind of the evidence for the thought, I guess.\n\nTherapist: That's good evidence to consider. Now, what about evidence against the thought? Have there been any times when you've exercised and felt better afterwards, even if it was just a little bit?\n\nPatient: I mean, there have been a few times when I actually had more energy after working out. And I usually feel a sense of accomplishment afterwards, like I did something good for myself.\n\nTherapist: That's really important evidence to remember. So even though there have been times when exercise left you feeling tired, there have also been times when it gave you more energy and a sense of accomplishment. It's not all or nothing. Now, let's look at the evidence on both sides and see if we can come up with a more balanced thought. What do you think would be a more helpful way to view the situation?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"Even if I feel tired afterwards, exercise might give me a little more energy and help me feel better about myself.\"\n\nTherapist: I think that's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges the possibility of feeling tired, but also recognizes the potential benefits of exercise. Now, with that alternative thought in mind, how intense are the feelings of hopelessness and frustration?\n\nPatient: The hopelessness feels more like a 50 now, and the frustration is maybe a 30.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant drop in intensity for both emotions. This is a great example of how examining our thoughts and finding a more balanced perspective can help shift our emotions. I want to acknowledge the great work you're doing in practicing this skill.\n\nPatient: Thanks, it does feel good to see the difference it can make.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And the more you practice, the more natural it will become. Now, I want to tie this back to the concept of behavioral activation we've been working on. When you're feeling hopeless and frustrated, it's really tempting to avoid activities like exercise. But as we just saw, avoidance can actually reinforce those negative thoughts and emotions. Whereas engaging in the activity, even if it's challenging, can help shift your perspective and improve your mood. Does that make sense?",
