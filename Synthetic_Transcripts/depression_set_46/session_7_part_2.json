  "transcript": "Patient: To be honest, I've had some trouble with the worry time technique. I keep forgetting to do it, and when I do remember, I find it hard to stick to the 15-minute limit. My mind just keeps wandering back to my worries throughout the day.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge when starting to use the worry time technique. It takes practice to train your mind to postpone worries and limit them to a specific time. Let's explore what might be making it difficult for you to stick to the 15-minute limit. Can you walk me through what happens when you try to do the worry time?\n\nPatient: Well, I usually set aside time in the evening, after dinner. I sit down with a notebook and start writing down my worries. But as I'm writing, I start to feel more and more anxious, and I can't seem to stop thinking about them even after the 15 minutes are up.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like the process of writing down your worries might be triggering more anxiety for you. That's valuable information. One thing we could try is modifying the worry time technique a bit. Instead of writing down your worries, you could try saying them out loud or recording them on your phone. Sometimes, changing the way we engage with our worries can make it easier to let them go after the allotted time. What do you think about giving that a try?\n\nPatient: That's an interesting idea. I hadn't thought about saying them out loud or recording them. I can give that a shot and see if it helps.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, the goal of worry time is to help you gain more control over your worries and limit the impact they have on your day. It's okay to experiment with different approaches until you find what works best for you. Now, let's take a look at the thought records you've been working on. How has that process been for you?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to do the thought records, but I'm not sure if I'm doing them right. I have trouble identifying the automatic thoughts sometimes, and I'm not always sure what kind of evidence to look for.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point to bring up. Identifying automatic thoughts can be tricky at first, and it's normal to feel unsure about the evidence. Let's walk through an example together, and I can help you break it down. Can you think of a situation from the past week where you noticed a strong emotion?\n\nPatient: Yeah, just the other day, I was supposed to meet a friend for lunch, but I ended up canceling at the last minute. I felt really guilty and down on myself about it.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's use that situation for the thought record. The first step is to identify the emotion you were feeling and rate its intensity on a scale of 0-100. What would you say the intensity of your guilt was in that moment?\n\nPatient: I'd say it was pretty high, maybe around 85.\n\nTherapist: Alright, now let's see if we can identify the automatic thought that was connected to that feeling of guilt. What was going through your mind when you decided to cancel the lunch?\n\nPatient: I was thinking that I'm a terrible friend and that I'm just letting everyone down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great catch. Those are the kinds of automatic thoughts we're looking for. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're a terrible friend?\n\nPatient: Well, I canceled the lunch at the last minute, and I've done that kind of thing before. I feel like I'm always flaking out on people.\n\nTherapist: Okay, and what about evidence against the thought? Are there times when you've been a good friend or followed through on plans?\n\nPatient: I guess there are times when I do show up for my friends. I've been there for them during tough times, and I try to be supportive when I can.\n\nTherapist: That's important to acknowledge. Now, let's look at the evidence on both sides and see if we can come up with an alternative thought that's more balanced. Based on the evidence, what's another way you could look at the situation?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could say that even though I struggle with following through on plans sometimes, that doesn't mean I'm a terrible friend. I do care about my friends, and I try to be there for them when I can.\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought! It acknowledges the struggle you have with following through on plans, but it also recognizes the efforts you make to be a good friend. Now, let's re-rate the intensity of the guilt you're feeling, with this alternative thought in mind. Where would you say it falls on the 0-100 scale now?\n\nPatient: I'd say it's lower, maybe around 50.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant drop in intensity. This is a great example of how challenging automatic thoughts and finding more balanced alternatives can help shift our emotions. As you practice this skill more, it will start to feel more natural, and you'll find it easier to identify and challenge those automatic thoughts in the moment.",
