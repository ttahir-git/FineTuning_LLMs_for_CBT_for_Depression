  "transcript": "Patient: Hi, I'm back for session 12. Here is the summary you provided me at the end of our last session:\n\n- Reviewed patient's experience with the modified worry time technique and thought records, focusing on identifying evidence against negative thoughts and generating alternative thoughts.\n- Explored patient's feelings of worthlessness and guilt, particularly in relation to relationships and a recent canceled plan with a friend.\n- Introduced the concept of core beliefs and used the downward arrow technique to identify a core belief of \"I'm not good enough\" underlying patient's negative thoughts about a difficult DIY project.\n- Discussed the concept of behavioral experiments and collaboratively developed a plan for patient to challenge core belief by taking on a new bookshelf project.\n- Introduced \"talking back\" technique for challenging self-critical thoughts and practiced developing specific \"talking back\" statements.\n- Checked in on patient's current mood and provided validation and encouragement for the progress made in therapy.\n- Assigned homework: Continue practicing the modified worry time technique daily, complete at least one thought record per day with a focus on identifying evidence against negative thoughts and generating alternative thoughts, start working on the bookshelf project with a focus on breaking it down into smaller steps and setting realistic goals, and practice \"talking back\" to self-critical thoughts.\n- Patient's depression symptoms remain present, with feelings of worthlessness and guilt being current challenges. The patient is showing increased insight into the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and is actively engaging in practicing CBT skills.\n- Plan for the next session: Review patient's experience with the modified worry time technique and thought records, with a focus on identifying evidence against negative thoughts and generating alternative thoughts. Discuss patient's progress with the bookshelf project and explore any challenges that arose. Continue practicing \"talking back\" technique and develop additional \"talking back\" statements. Address any other concerns or topics the patient would like to discuss.\n\nTherapist: Hello Robert, it's good to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please let me know if there's anything important I might be missing. With that said, how have you been since our last session? How has your mood been, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. My mood has been relatively stable, although I still have moments where I feel down or discouraged. I've been trying to keep up with the techniques we've discussed, like the modified worry time and thought records. It's been helpful to have those tools, but it's not always easy to put them into practice. One thing that's been on my mind is the bookshelf project we talked about last time. I've made some progress on it, but I've also been struggling with self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've found the techniques we've discussed helpful, even if it's not always easy to apply them. It's completely normal to have moments of self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy, especially when taking on new challenges like the bookshelf project. I'm proud of you for making progress on it despite those difficulties. Today, I'd like to focus on exploring those feelings further and see how we can work through them together. We can also discuss your experience with the modified worry time and thought records, and see if there are any adjustments we can make to better support you. How does that sound for our agenda today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I definitely want to talk more about the bookshelf project and the feelings that have come up around it. I also think it would be helpful to review the modified worry time and thought records, as I'm not sure I'm using them as effectively as I could be. There's one other thing I wanted to bring up - I had a bit of a falling out with a friend recently, and it's been weighing on me. I'm not sure if it's related to my depression, but I thought it might be worth discussing.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss the falling out with your friend and explore how it might be impacting your mental health. It's important that we address the things that are weighing on you, even if they don't seem directly related to your depression. Our agenda for today will be:\n1. Discuss your progress and challenges with the bookshelf project, focusing on the feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy that have come up.\n2. Review your experience with the modified worry time and thought records, and see if there are any adjustments we can make to better support you.\n3. Explore the falling out with your friend and how it might be impacting your mental health.\nDoes this agenda work for you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think that agenda covers everything I wanted to discuss today. I'm ready to dive in whenever you are.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by discussing your progress and challenges with the bookshelf project. You mentioned that you've made some progress but have also been struggling with self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been challenging for you?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been able to get started on the project, which is good. I've cut all the pieces and have started assembling them. But as I'm working on it, I keep having these thoughts like \"This isn't going to turn out well\" or \"I'm not skilled enough to do this right.\" It's like there's this voice in my head telling me that I'm going to fail, even though I'm putting in the effort.\n\nTherapist: I understand how those thoughts can be discouraging and make it difficult to stay motivated. It sounds like you're experiencing some negative automatic thoughts related to the bookshelf project. Let's explore this further. When you have those thoughts, what emotions do you notice coming up?\n\nPatient: I feel frustrated, mostly with myself. I also feel a bit hopeless, like no matter how hard I try, it won't be good enough. And I guess there's some shame too, like I should be better at this.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important insights, Robert. I appreciate you sharing that with me. What you're describing is a great example of how our thoughts can influence our emotions and even our behaviors. The negative thoughts you're having about the bookshelf project are leading to feelings of frustration, hopelessness, and shame, which I imagine might make it harder to stay motivated and keep working on it.\n\nPatient: Yeah, that's exactly right. It's like I get stuck in this cycle of negative thinking, and it's hard to break out of it.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience, and it's something we can work on together. One technique that can be helpful in situations like this is cognitive restructuring, which involves identifying negative thoughts and challenging them by looking at the evidence for and against them. We've done some work with thought records before, but let's try applying it to this specific situation with the bookshelf project.\n\nLet's start by identifying the most prominent negative thought you're having about the project. What would you say is the main thought that's been bothering you?\n\nPatient: I think the main thought is \"I'm not skilled enough to do this right.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write that down as the negative automatic thought. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not skilled enough?\n\nPatient: Well, I've made some mistakes while working on the project, like cutting a piece too short or not getting the measurements exactly right. And I've struggled with some of the more technical aspects, like making sure everything is level and square.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid points, and it's good to acknowledge the challenges you've faced. Now, let's look at the evidence against that thought. What evidence do you have that suggests you are skilled enough to complete this project?\n\nPatient: I guess I have completed other projects in the past that were similar to this one. And even though I've made some mistakes, I've been able to problem-solve and find ways to fix them. I also have been learning a lot as I go, so even if I'm not an expert, I'm developing my skills.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of evidence against the negative thought. It's important to recognize that even though you may be facing challenges, you have the ability to problem-solve and learn from them. Let's look at the evidence for and against the negative thought and see if we can come up with a more balanced alternative thought.\n\nBased on the evidence, what would be a more accurate and helpful way to think about your skills in relation to the bookshelf project?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be something like \"I may not be an expert, but I have the skills and ability to complete this project, even if I face challenges along the way.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Robert. It acknowledges the challenges you've faced while also recognizing your abilities and potential for growth. How does that thought feel compared to the original negative thought?\n\nPatient: It feels a lot more hopeful and motivating. Like, I can acknowledge that it's not going to be perfect, but that doesn't mean I can't do it.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By challenging the negative thought and coming up with a more balanced alternative, we can shift our perspective and feel more empowered to keep moving forward. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the easier it becomes.\n\nI'd like to challenge you to continue practicing this skill as you work on the bookshelf project. When you notice those negative thoughts coming up, try to pause and go through the process of looking at the evidence for and against them, and coming up with a more balanced alternative thought. It can be helpful to write it down in a thought record, like we just did together.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll definitely try to do that. It's just hard sometimes to catch those thoughts in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, and it's something that a lot of people struggle with at first. One thing that can be helpful is to set aside a specific time each day to reflect on your thoughts and practice this skill. It could be part of your modified worry time or just a separate time that works for you. The more you practice, the easier it will become to catch those thoughts in the moment.\n\nAnother thing that can be helpful is to have some go-to phrases or mantras that you can use to challenge those negative thoughts. We've talked before about the \"talking back\" technique, where you come up with specific statements to counteract self-critical thoughts. Let's brainstorm some phrases you could use related to the bookshelf project.\n\nWhat are some things you could tell yourself when you start having those negative thoughts about your skills or the outcome of the project?\n\nPatient: I could remind myself that \"Mistakes are part of the learning process\" or \"I have the ability to problem-solve and figure this out.\" Or even just something simple like \"I am capable and competent.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are all great examples of \"talking back\" statements. Having those phrases ready can be a powerful tool in challenging negative thoughts and shifting your perspective. I encourage you to write those down and keep them somewhere accessible, like on your phone or a sticky note near your workspace.\n\nAs you continue working on the bookshelf project, try to incorporate both the thought records and the \"talking back\" statements. It might feel a bit awkward or forced at first, but the more you practice, the more natural it will become.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll definitely give that a try. It's helpful to have some concrete tools to use when those negative thoughts come up.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find those tools helpful, Robert. Remember, it's a skill that takes practice, so be patient with yourself as you're learning. We can continue to work on it together in our sessions.\n\nBefore we move on to the next topic, I want to check in with how you're feeling about the bookshelf project and the negative thoughts you've been having. How are you feeling now, after going through the cognitive restructuring process?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful and motivated. It's helpful to recognize that those negative thoughts aren't necessarily true, and that I have evidence to counteract them. I know it's going to take practice, but I feel like I have some tools now to work with.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Robert. It's wonderful that you're feeling more hopeful and motivated after going through this process. Recognizing that negative thoughts aren't always accurate and that you have the power to challenge them is a big step in managing depression.\n\nI want to acknowledge the effort you've put into this session and the progress you've made. It takes courage to face negative thoughts and work on challenging them. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. It's not easy, but it helps to have your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Robert. I'm happy to be here for you. Let's move on to the next topic on our agenda, which is reviewing your experience with the modified worry time and thought records. How have those been going for you since our last session?\n\nPatient: They've been going okay, I think. I've been trying to do the modified worry time every day, and it has been helpful to have a designated time to focus on my worries instead of letting them take over all the time. But I've noticed that I still tend to get caught up in worries outside of that time, especially when I'm trying to fall asleep at night.\n\nWith the thought records, I've been doing them when I remember to, but I don't always feel like I'm doing them right. Sometimes it's hard to identify the evidence against my negative thoughts, or I feel like I'm just going through the motions without really believing the alternative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Robert. It's common to face challenges when implementing these techniques, and it's good that you're able to recognize what's been difficult for you.\n\nRegarding the modified worry time, it's great that you've been consistent with doing it every day. It's also normal to still experience worries outside of that designated time, especially in moments when your mind is more prone to wandering, like when you're trying to fall asleep. One thing that can be helpful is to have a plan for how to handle those worries when they come up outside of worry time.\n\nFor example, you could try briefly acknowledging the worry, reminding yourself that you have a designated time to address it, and then gently redirecting your attention to something else, like focusing on your breath or a calming mental image. It's not about trying to suppress the worry completely, but rather about postponing it until your worry time.\n\nAs for the thought records, it's okay if you don't always feel like you're doing them perfectly. The important thing is that you're making an effort to engage with the process. When you're having trouble identifying evidence against your negative thoughts, it can be helpful to think about what you would say to a friend who was having those same thoughts. We're often more compassionate and objective when it comes to other people than we are with ourselves.\n\nIt's also normal to feel like you're going through the motions at times, especially when you're first starting out with this skill. The more you practice, the more natural it will feel, and the more you'll start to internalize those alternative thoughts. It can be helpful to try to really connect with the alternative thoughts on an emotional level, not just an intellectual one.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of thinking about what I would say to a friend who was having those same thoughts. That might make it easier to come up with evidence against the negative thoughts.\n\nAnd I'll try to be more patient with myself when it comes to the thought records. I know it's a skill that takes time to develop, so I shouldn't expect myself to be perfect at it right away.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Robert. Being patient and compassionate with yourself is so important in this process. Learning to challenge negative thoughts is a skill, just like any other, and it takes time and practice to develop.\n\nI'm glad you found the suggestion about thinking of what you would say to a friend helpful. That's a great strategy to use when you're having trouble generating evidence against negative thoughts.\n\nAnother thing that can be helpful is to try to connect with the alternative thoughts on a deeper level. When you come up with an alternative thought, take a moment to really imagine what it would feel like if you fully believed that thought. How would it change your emotional experience and your behavior?\n\nFor example, if the alternative thought is \"I am capable and competent,\" try to really envision yourself feeling confident and empowered. Imagine how you would carry yourself and approach the bookshelf project differently if you fully believed in your own capabilities.\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be helpful. It's one thing to intellectually know that an alternative thought is more accurate, but it's another thing to really feel it on an emotional level.\n\nI'll try to take that extra step of really imagining myself believing the alternative thoughts. I can see how that could make a big difference in how I feel and act.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Robert. Connecting with the alternative thoughts on an emotional level can be really powerful in shifting your overall mindset and experience.\n\nIt's great that you're open to trying that out. Remember, it's a practice, and it might feel a bit awkward or unnatural at first. But the more you do it, the more it will start to feel authentic and true for you.\n\nI'd like to challenge you to continue practicing the modified worry time and thought records, incorporating the strategies we've discussed today. And remember, it's okay if it's not perfect. The important thing is that you're making an effort and being consistent with the practice.\n\nPatient: I will definitely keep practicing. It's helpful to have these tools and strategies to work with, even if it's not always easy.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find the tools and strategies helpful, Robert. And you're right, it's not always easy, but it's worth the effort. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nLet's move on to the next topic on our agenda, which is the falling out you had with your friend recently. Can you tell me more about what happened and how it's been impacting you?\n\nTherapist: I understand how a falling out with a friend can be really challenging and impact your mental health. Conflict and tension in relationships can often trigger negative thoughts and emotions, especially for someone dealing with depression. Can you tell me more about what happened with your friend and how it's been affecting you?\n\nPatient: Well, my friend and I had made plans to get together last weekend, but he ended up canceling at the last minute. He said something came up with work, but I guess I felt like he just didn't want to hang out with me. It brought up a lot of those feelings of worthlessness and like I'm not important to people.\n\nTherapist: I can see how that would be really difficult, especially given the negative thoughts and beliefs we've been working on challenging. It sounds like this situation triggered some of those core beliefs about yourself and your worth. Let's explore this further.\n\nWhat thoughts went through your mind when your friend canceled the plans? What emotions did you notice coming up?\n\nPatient: I guess I immediately started thinking that he just didn't value our friendship or care about me. I felt really sad and disappointed, but also kind of angry at him for canceling. And then I started beating myself up, thinking that I must have done something wrong or that I'm just not fun to be around.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Robert. It's clear how this situation tapped into some of those deeper beliefs and negative thought patterns we've been working on. I want to acknowledge the emotions that came up for you - the sadness, disappointment, and anger are all valid responses to feeling let down by a friend.\n\nLet's take a step back and look at the thoughts you had in that moment. It sounds like there were a few key negative automatic thoughts, like \"He doesn't value our friendship\" and \"I must have done something wrong.\" I'd like to explore those thoughts further and see if we can challenge them using some of the CBT techniques we've been practicing.\n\nAre you open to doing a thought record together on this situation with your friend?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that could be helpful. I know I tend to jump to negative conclusions, so it would be good to try to look at it more objectively.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's do that. We'll start by identifying the most prominent negative automatic thought you had in that situation. What would you say was the main thought that was driving your emotional response?\n\nPatient: I think the main thought was \"He doesn't value our friendship or care about me.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write that down as the negative automatic thought. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your friend doesn't value your friendship or care about you?\n\nPatient: Well, he canceled our plans at the last minute, and he didn't seem to have a very good reason. And he didn't suggest rescheduling or anything.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid points, and I can see how they would lead you to question his investment in the friendship. Now, let's look at the evidence against that thought. What evidence do you have that suggests your friend does value your friendship and care about you?\n\nPatient: I guess I have to remember that this is just one incident, and we've had a lot of good times together in the past. And he's always been there for me when I needed him, like when my brother died. He checked in on me a lot during that time.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important pieces of evidence to consider. It sounds like your friend has shown care and investment in your friendship in significant ways, even if this particular situation was disappointing.\n\nLet's look at the evidence for and against the negative thought and see if we can come up with a more balanced alternative thought. Based on the evidence, what would be a more accurate and helpful way to think about your friend's actions and feelings towards you?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be something like \"Even though he canceled this time, our friendship has a history of care and support, and one incident doesn't negate that.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Robert. It acknowledges the disappointment of the situation while also recognizing the broader context of your friendship. How does that thought feel compared to the original negative thought?\n\nPatient: It feels a lot more balanced and less extreme. I guess I was jumping to conclusions based on one incident, without considering the bigger picture of our friendship.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Robert. It's easy to get caught up in the emotions of a disappointing situation and lose sight of the larger context. By challenging the negative thought and coming up with a more balanced alternative, we can shift our perspective and feel more grounded.\n\nI'd like to challenge you to continue practicing this skill when you find yourself having negative thoughts about your relationships. It can be helpful to take a step back and look at the evidence for and against the thought, and try to come up with a more balanced perspective.\n\nPatient: I will definitely try to do that. It's not easy, but I can see how it could make a big difference in how I feel and react to situations.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it's not always easy, but it's a skill that gets easier with practice. And it can have a big impact on your emotional well-being and your relationships.\n\nBefore we wrap up, I want to check in with how you're feeling now, after going through this process with the situation with your friend. How are you feeling about the situation and about yourself in relation to it?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more at peace with it. I still feel disappointed about the canceled plans, but I don't feel as upset or down on myself about it. I can see how I was jumping to negative conclusions, and that's not really fair to myself or to my friend.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Robert. It's great that you're able to have a more balanced and compassionate perspective on the situation. Being able to challenge those negative thoughts and shift your emotional response is a big step in managing depression.\n\nI want to acknowledge the effort you've put into this session and the progress you've made. It takes courage to face negative thoughts and work on challenging them, especially when it comes to relationships and feelings of self-worth. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. It's not easy, but it helps to have your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Robert. I'm happy to be here for you. Let's wrap up by discussing some homework for you to work on before our next session.\n\nI'd like to challenge you to continue practicing the modified worry time and thought records, incorporating the strategies we've discussed today. Try to do a thought record whenever you notice yourself having a strong emotional reaction to a situation, and see if you can come up with a more balanced alternative thought.\n\nI also encourage you to continue working on the bookshelf project, using the \"talking back\" statements we brainstormed to challenge any negative thoughts that come up. Remember to connect with the alternative thoughts on an emotional level, not just an intellectual one.\n\nFinally, I'd like you to practice the skill of challenging negative thoughts in relation to your relationships, like we did with the situation with your friend. When you find yourself having negative thoughts about your relationships or your worth in them, try to take a step back and look at the evidence for and against those thoughts.\n\nDoes this homework feel manageable for you? Do you have any questions or concerns about it?\n\nPatient: It feels manageable. I know it's going to take practice, but I feel like I have some good tools to work with now. I don't have any questions at the moment, but I'll let you know if anything comes up.\n\nTherapist: Great, I'm glad the homework feels manageable for you. Remember, it's okay if it's not perfect. The important thing is that you're making an effort and being consistent with the practice.\n\nIf any questions or concerns do come up, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you and help you work through any challenges that arise.\n\nBefore we end our session, I want to do a quick check-in on your current mood. Can you give me a sense of how you're feeling right now, and if there's anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling okay right now. A bit tired, but also more hopeful than I was at the beginning of the session. I don't think there's anything else I need to discuss right now. I feel like we covered a lot of ground today.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful, Robert. I'm glad we were able to cover a lot of ground today and that you're feeling okay.\n\nI want to thank you for your hard work and openness in our session today. I know this work isn't easy, but I'm consistently impressed by your willingness to engage with it and your insights throughout the process.\n\nRemember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. If anything comes up between now and our next session, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nTake care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Reviewed patient's experience with the modified worry time technique and thought records, focusing on identifying evidence against negative thoughts and generating alternative thoughts.\n- Discussed patient's progress and challenges with the bookshelf project, exploring feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy that arose.
