  "transcript": "Therapist: I understand how a falling out with a friend can be really challenging and impact your mental health. Conflict and tension in relationships can often trigger negative thoughts and emotions, especially for someone dealing with depression. Can you tell me more about what happened with your friend and how it's been affecting you?\n\nPatient: Well, my friend and I had made plans to get together last weekend, but he ended up canceling at the last minute. He said something came up with work, but I guess I felt like he just didn't want to hang out with me. It brought up a lot of those feelings of worthlessness and like I'm not important to people.\n\nTherapist: I can see how that would be really difficult, especially given the negative thoughts and beliefs we've been working on challenging. It sounds like this situation triggered some of those core beliefs about yourself and your worth. Let's explore this further.\n\nWhat thoughts went through your mind when your friend canceled the plans? What emotions did you notice coming up?\n\nPatient: I guess I immediately started thinking that he just didn't value our friendship or care about me. I felt really sad and disappointed, but also kind of angry at him for canceling. And then I started beating myself up, thinking that I must have done something wrong or that I'm just not fun to be around.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Robert. It's clear how this situation tapped into some of those deeper beliefs and negative thought patterns we've been working on. I want to acknowledge the emotions that came up for you - the sadness, disappointment, and anger are all valid responses to feeling let down by a friend.\n\nLet's take a step back and look at the thoughts you had in that moment. It sounds like there were a few key negative automatic thoughts, like \"He doesn't value our friendship\" and \"I must have done something wrong.\" I'd like to explore those thoughts further and see if we can challenge them using some of the CBT techniques we've been practicing.\n\nAre you open to doing a thought record together on this situation with your friend?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that could be helpful. I know I tend to jump to negative conclusions, so it would be good to try to look at it more objectively.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's do that. We'll start by identifying the most prominent negative automatic thought you had in that situation. What would you say was the main thought that was driving your emotional response?\n\nPatient: I think the main thought was \"He doesn't value our friendship or care about me.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write that down as the negative automatic thought. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your friend doesn't value your friendship or care about you?\n\nPatient: Well, he canceled our plans at the last minute, and he didn't seem to have a very good reason. And he didn't suggest rescheduling or anything.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid points, and I can see how they would lead you to question his investment in the friendship. Now, let's look at the evidence against that thought. What evidence do you have that suggests your friend does value your friendship and care about you?\n\nPatient: I guess I have to remember that this is just one incident, and we've had a lot of good times together in the past. And he's always been there for me when I needed him, like when my brother died. He checked in on me a lot during that time.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important pieces of evidence to consider. It sounds like your friend has shown care and investment in your friendship in significant ways, even if this particular situation was disappointing.\n\nLet's look at the evidence for and against the negative thought and see if we can come up with a more balanced alternative thought. Based on the evidence, what would be a more accurate and helpful way to think about your friend's actions and feelings towards you?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be something like \"Even though he canceled this time, our friendship has a history of care and support, and one incident doesn't negate that.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Robert. It acknowledges the disappointment of the situation while also recognizing the broader context of your friendship. How does that thought feel compared to the original negative thought?",
