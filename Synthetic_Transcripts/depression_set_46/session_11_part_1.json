  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Robert, it's good to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the modified worry time technique and complete thought records as you suggested. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some progress in managing my negative thoughts. However, I've still been struggling with feelings of worthlessness and guilt, especially when it comes to my relationships with others.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we discussed and that you've noticed some progress. It's understandable that feelings of worthlessness and guilt can persist, especially when it comes to relationships. Let's make sure to address those feelings today. How about we start by reviewing your experience with the modified worry time technique and thought records, and then we can explore the challenges you've been facing with worthlessness and guilt. Does that sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I think I could use some help in understanding why these feelings keep coming up despite my efforts to challenge my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, and we can definitely explore that together. Before we do, I want to check in on the homework I assigned last session. Were you able to schedule a social interaction as we discussed?\n\nPatient: I did reach out to an old friend and we made plans to meet up, but they ended up canceling at the last minute. It brought up a lot of those feelings of being unimportant and not valued.\n\nTherapist: I can understand how that experience would trigger those feelings, especially given the progress you've been making in challenging similar thoughts. Let's add that to our agenda for today, to explore how that situation impacted you and how we can work through it together. We can also discuss strategies for continuing to reach out and connect with others, even when faced with setbacks. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds really helpful. I appreciate you being willing to address these challenges with me.\n\nTherapist: Of course, that's what I'm here for. Let's start by reviewing your thought records from the past week. Can you share an example of a thought you worked on and how you challenged it?",
