  "transcript": "Patient: I think that agenda covers everything I wanted to discuss today. I'm ready to dive in whenever you are.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by discussing your progress and challenges with the bookshelf project. You mentioned that you've made some progress but have also been struggling with self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been challenging for you?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been able to get started on the project, which is good. I've cut all the pieces and have started assembling them. But as I'm working on it, I keep having these thoughts like \"This isn't going to turn out well\" or \"I'm not skilled enough to do this right.\" It's like there's this voice in my head telling me that I'm going to fail, even though I'm putting in the effort.\n\nTherapist: I understand how those thoughts can be discouraging and make it difficult to stay motivated. It sounds like you're experiencing some negative automatic thoughts related to the bookshelf project. Let's explore this further. When you have those thoughts, what emotions do you notice coming up?\n\nPatient: I feel frustrated, mostly with myself. I also feel a bit hopeless, like no matter how hard I try, it won't be good enough. And I guess there's some shame too, like I should be better at this.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important insights, Robert. I appreciate you sharing that with me. What you're describing is a great example of how our thoughts can influence our emotions and even our behaviors. The negative thoughts you're having about the bookshelf project are leading to feelings of frustration, hopelessness, and shame, which I imagine might make it harder to stay motivated and keep working on it.\n\nPatient: Yeah, that's exactly right. It's like I get stuck in this cycle of negative thinking, and it's hard to break out of it.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience, and it's something we can work on together. One technique that can be helpful in situations like this is cognitive restructuring, which involves identifying negative thoughts and challenging them by looking at the evidence for and against them. We've done some work with thought records before, but let's try applying it to this specific situation with the bookshelf project.\n\nLet's start by identifying the most prominent negative thought you're having about the project. What would you say is the main thought that's been bothering you?\n\nPatient: I think the main thought is \"I'm not skilled enough to do this right.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write that down as the negative automatic thought. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not skilled enough?\n\nPatient: Well, I've made some mistakes while working on the project, like cutting a piece too short or not getting the measurements exactly right. And I've struggled with some of the more technical aspects, like making sure everything is level and square.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid points, and it's good to acknowledge the challenges you've faced. Now, let's look at the evidence against that thought. What evidence do you have that suggests you are skilled enough to complete this project?\n\nPatient: I guess I have completed other projects in the past that were similar to this one. And even though I've made some mistakes, I've been able to problem-solve and find ways to fix them. I also have been learning a lot as I go, so even if I'm not an expert, I'm developing my skills.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of evidence against the negative thought. It's important to recognize that even though you may be facing challenges, you have the ability to problem-solve and learn from them. Let's look at the evidence for and against the negative thought and see if we can come up with a more balanced alternative thought.\n\nBased on the evidence, what would be a more accurate and helpful way to think about your skills in relation to the bookshelf project?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be something like \"I may not be an expert, but I have the skills and ability to complete this project, even if I face challenges along the way.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Robert. It acknowledges the challenges you've faced while also recognizing your abilities and potential for growth. How does that thought feel compared to the original negative thought?\n\nPatient: It feels a lot more hopeful and motivating. Like, I can acknowledge that it's not going to be perfect, but that doesn't mean I can't do it.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By challenging the negative thought and coming up with a more balanced alternative, we can shift our perspective and feel more empowered to keep moving forward. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the easier it becomes.\n\nI'd like to challenge you to continue practicing this skill as you work on the bookshelf project. When you notice those negative thoughts coming up, try to pause and go through the process of looking at the evidence for and against them, and coming up with a more balanced alternative thought. It can be helpful to write it down in a thought record, like we just did together.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll definitely try to do that. It's just hard sometimes to catch those thoughts in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, and it's something that a lot of people struggle with at first. One thing that can be helpful is to set aside a specific time each day to reflect on your thoughts and practice this skill. It could be part of your modified worry time or just a separate time that works for you. The more you practice, the easier it will become to catch those thoughts in the moment.\n\nAnother thing that can be helpful is to have some go-to phrases or mantras that you can use to challenge those negative thoughts. We've talked before about the \"talking back\" technique, where you come up with specific statements to counteract self-critical thoughts. Let's brainstorm some phrases you could use related to the bookshelf project.\n\nWhat are some things you could tell yourself when you start having those negative thoughts about your skills or the outcome of the project?\n\nPatient: I could remind myself that \"Mistakes are part of the learning process\" or \"I have the ability to problem-solve and figure this out.\" Or even just something simple like \"I am capable and competent.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are all great examples of \"talking back\" statements. Having those phrases ready can be a powerful tool in challenging negative thoughts and shifting your perspective. I encourage you to write those down and keep them somewhere accessible, like on your phone or a sticky note near your workspace.\n\nAs you continue working on the bookshelf project, try to incorporate both the thought records and the \"talking back\" statements. It might feel a bit awkward or forced at first, but the more you practice, the more natural it will become.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll definitely give that a try. It's helpful to have some concrete tools to use when those negative thoughts come up.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find those tools helpful, Robert. Remember, it's a skill that takes practice, so be patient with yourself as you're learning. We can continue to work on it together in our sessions.\n\nBefore we move on to the next topic, I want to check in with how you're feeling about the bookshelf project and the negative thoughts you've been having. How are you feeling now, after going through the cognitive restructuring process?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful and motivated. It's helpful to recognize that those negative thoughts aren't necessarily true, and that I have evidence to counteract them. I know it's going to take practice, but I feel like I have some tools now to work with.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Robert. It's wonderful that you're feeling more hopeful and motivated after going through this process. Recognizing that negative thoughts aren't always accurate and that you have the power to challenge them is a big step in managing depression.\n\nI want to acknowledge the effort you've put into this session and the progress you've made. It takes courage to face negative thoughts and work on challenging them. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. It's not easy, but it helps to have your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Robert. I'm happy to be here for you. Let's move on to the next topic on our agenda, which is reviewing your experience with the modified worry time and thought records. How have those been going for you since our last session?\n\nPatient: They've been going okay, I think. I've been trying to do the modified worry time every day, and it has been helpful to have a designated time to focus on my worries instead of letting them take over all the time. But I've noticed that I still tend to get caught up in worries outside of that time, especially when I'm trying to fall asleep at night.\n\nWith the thought records, I've been doing them when I remember to, but I don't always feel like I'm doing them right. Sometimes it's hard to identify the evidence against my negative thoughts, or I feel like I'm just going through the motions without really believing the alternative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Robert. It's common to face challenges when implementing these techniques, and it's good that you're able to recognize what's been difficult for you.\n\nRegarding the modified worry time, it's great that you've been consistent with doing it every day. It's also normal to still experience worries outside of that designated time, especially in moments when your mind is more prone to wandering, like when you're trying to fall asleep. One thing that can be helpful is to have a plan for how to handle those worries when they come up outside of worry time.\n\nFor example, you could try briefly acknowledging the worry, reminding yourself that you have a designated time to address it, and then gently redirecting your attention to something else, like focusing on your breath or a calming mental image. It's not about trying to suppress the worry completely, but rather about postponing it until your worry time.\n\nAs for the thought records, it's okay if you don't always feel like you're doing them perfectly. The important thing is that you're making an effort to engage with the process. When you're having trouble identifying evidence against your negative thoughts, it can be helpful to think about what you would say to a friend who was having those same thoughts. We're often more compassionate and objective when it comes to other people than we are with ourselves.\n\nIt's also normal to feel like you're going through the motions at times, especially when you're first starting out with this skill. The more you practice, the more natural it will feel, and the more you'll start to internalize those alternative thoughts. It can be helpful to try to really connect with the alternative thoughts on an emotional level, not just an intellectual one.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of thinking about what I would say to a friend who was having those same thoughts. That might make it easier to come up with evidence against the negative thoughts.\n\nAnd I'll try to be more patient with myself when it comes to the thought records. I know it's a skill that takes time to develop, so I shouldn't expect myself to be perfect at it right away.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Robert. Being patient and compassionate with yourself is so important in this process. Learning to challenge negative thoughts is a skill, just like any other, and it takes time and practice to develop.\n\nI'm glad you found the suggestion about thinking of what you would say to a friend helpful. That's a great strategy to use when you're having trouble generating evidence against negative thoughts.\n\nAnother thing that can be helpful is to try to connect with the alternative thoughts on a deeper level. When you come up with an alternative thought, take a moment to really imagine what it would feel like if you fully believed that thought. How would it change your emotional experience and your behavior?\n\nFor example, if the alternative thought is \"I am capable and competent,\" try to really envision yourself feeling confident and empowered. Imagine how you would carry yourself and approach the bookshelf project differently if you fully believed in your own capabilities.\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be helpful. It's one thing to intellectually know that an alternative thought is more accurate, but it's another thing to really feel it on an emotional level.\n\nI'll try to take that extra step of really imagining myself believing the alternative thoughts. I can see how that could make a big difference in how I feel and act.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Robert. Connecting with the alternative thoughts on an emotional level can be really powerful in shifting your overall mindset and experience.\n\nIt's great that you're open to trying that out. Remember, it's a practice, and it might feel a bit awkward or unnatural at first. But the more you do it, the more it will start to feel authentic and true for you.\n\nI'd like to challenge you to continue practicing the modified worry time and thought records, incorporating the strategies we've discussed today. And remember, it's okay if it's not perfect. The important thing is that you're making an effort and being consistent with the practice.\n\nPatient: I will definitely keep practicing. It's helpful to have these tools and strategies to work with, even if it's not always easy.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find the tools and strategies helpful, Robert. And you're right, it's not always easy, but it's worth the effort. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nLet's move on to the next topic on our agenda, which is the falling out you had with your friend recently. Can you tell me more about what happened and how it's been impacting you?",
