  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Robert, it's good to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, so please let me know if something doesn't seem quite right. Additionally, as an AI, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a crisis situation, it's essential to reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency services immediately. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so I'll be relying on your written communication to understand your experiences and emotions. With that said, how have you been since our last session? Can you share with me how your mood has been and if there have been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to discuss today?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay, I guess. I've been trying to keep up with the thought records and the modified worry time technique, but it's been challenging at times. My mood has been up and down, with more downs than ups, to be honest. I find myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns, and it's hard to break out of them. I did have a small victory with the bookshelf project, though. I managed to finish building the frame, which felt good, but then I started doubting my abilities again when it came to the finer details.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've had some success with the bookshelf project, Robert. It's a significant accomplishment, and it's essential to acknowledge and celebrate those moments. Regarding the negative thought patterns, that's something we can definitely work on together. Before we dive deeper into that, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. We can discuss your progress with the thought records and the modified worry time technique, explore the challenges you've faced with the bookshelf project, and work on strategies to help you break out of those negative thought patterns. Does that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I think those are the main things I'd like to focus on today. I also wanted to mention that I had a bit of a falling out with my daughter last week. It's been weighing on my mind, and I think it's contributed to my low mood. We had a disagreement over the phone, and I said some things I regret. I don't know how to fix it, and I feel guilty for letting my emotions get the best of me.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you bringing up the situation with your daughter, Robert. Conflict with loved ones can be challenging and emotionally draining. Let's add that to our agenda for today, and we can explore the thoughts and emotions surrounding the situation and work on developing a plan to address it. So, our agenda for today includes:\n1. Reviewing your progress with thought records and the modified worry time technique\n2. Discussing the challenges with the bookshelf project and strategies to overcome negative thought patterns\n3. Exploring the situation with your daughter and developing a plan to address it\n\nDoes this agenda cover everything you'd like to focus on today, or is there anything else you'd like to add?",
