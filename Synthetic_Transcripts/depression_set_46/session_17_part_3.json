  "transcript": "Patient: One thought that keeps running through my head is that I'll never be able to sleep well again. It's like I'm convinced that I'm just destined to have poor sleep for the rest of my life.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of a negative thought that we can work with. This type of thinking is often referred to as \"fortune telling,\" which is a cognitive distortion where we predict negative outcomes without evidence. Let's explore this further. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you'll never be able to sleep well again?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been struggling with sleep for so long now, and nothing seems to work. I've tried different strategies, but I still have nights where I can't shut off my mind.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it feels like you've been struggling for a long time, and that can be incredibly frustrating. However, I want to point out that you have been making efforts to improve your sleep, like practicing the sleep hygiene strategies we discussed. While you may not be seeing the results you want yet, it doesn't mean that you'll never be able to sleep well again. Let's look at the evidence against this thought. Have there been any nights where you've been able to sleep better, even if it's just a little bit?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been a few nights here and there where I've been able to fall asleep a bit more easily, or I've woken up less frequently. It's not perfect, but I suppose it's something.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Those moments, even if they're few and far between, are evidence against the idea that you'll never be able to sleep well again. It's important to recognize and celebrate those small victories, as they show that change is possible. Now, let's try to come up with an alternative thought that's more balanced and based on the evidence. What could be a more helpful way to view your sleep difficulties?\n\nPatient: I could try to remind myself that even though I'm struggling now, I have made some progress, and there's still hope for improvement in the future.\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought! It acknowledges the challenges you're facing while also recognizing the progress you've made and maintaining a sense of hope. How does that thought feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It feels a bit more encouraging, like I'm not just stuck in this cycle forever.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful. Remember, challenging these negative thoughts takes practice, and it's okay if you don't always believe the alternative thought right away. The more you work on reframing these thoughts, the more natural it will become over time. Let's continue to explore some of the other cognitive distortions that may be contributing to your sleep difficulties and practice challenging them together.",
