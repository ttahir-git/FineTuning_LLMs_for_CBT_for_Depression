  "transcript": "Therapist: It's understandable that phone calls can feel different from in-person interactions, Robert. Sometimes it can be helpful to have a few topics in mind before the call, just to get the conversation started. You could ask about their latest projects or hobbies, or share a memory that you've been thinking about lately. Even small updates about your day-to-day life can help maintain that sense of connection.\n\nAnother option is to explore other ways of staying in touch, like sending emails or letters. Sometimes writing can feel a bit easier than talking on the phone, and it gives you a chance to express your thoughts more fully.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I could try writing a letter to each of my kids, just to let them know I'm thinking about them. It might be easier for me to express myself that way.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Writing can be a powerful way to communicate your feelings, and it gives your kids something tangible to hold onto. You could even include a few photos or small mementos with the letters, to add a personal touch.\n\nAnother thing to consider is planning a visit, if that's feasible. Even if it's just once or twice a year, having that in-person time together can really help strengthen your bond.\n\nPatient: I would love to visit them, but I worry about the cost and the logistics. It just feels overwhelming to plan a trip like that.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, Robert. Travel can be stressful, both financially and logistically. Perhaps we could break it down into smaller steps. You could start by reaching out to your kids and letting them know you'd like to plan a visit. Then, together, you could look at dates that work for everyone and start exploring travel options. Taking it one step at a time can make it feel more manageable.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I've been getting ahead of myself, thinking about all the details at once. I could start by just bringing up the idea with them and see what they say.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great first step, Robert. And remember, even if a visit isn't possible right now, there are still ways to maintain that connection from a distance. The letters, phone calls, and even video chats can all help bridge that gap until you're able to see each other in person.\n\nPatient: I appreciate that reminder. It's easy to get discouraged when I can't see them as often as I'd like. But you're right, there are still ways to stay connected.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's about finding what works for you and your family, even if it looks a bit different from what you're used to. And remember, your kids know that you care about them, even if you can't express it in person as often as you'd like. The effort you're making to stay in touch matters, even if it doesn't always feel like enough.\n\nNow, I want to make sure we have time to discuss the mindfulness and grounding exercises we introduced last session. How has your experience been with those techniques?",
