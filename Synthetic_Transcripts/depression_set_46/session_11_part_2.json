  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share an example from my thought records. A few days ago, I was working on a DIY project, and I couldn't seem to get it right. I started feeling frustrated and upset, and the thought that kept running through my mind was \"I'm useless, I can't even get this simple project right.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Robert. I can see how that situation would trigger feelings of frustration and self-doubt. Let's walk through the process of challenging that thought. What evidence did you find that supports the idea that you're useless?\n\nPatient: Well, I couldn't get the project right, even though I've done similar ones before. It felt like I should have been able to do it easily, but I just couldn't seem to make it work.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so the difficulty with the project felt like evidence that you're useless. What evidence did you find against that thought?\n\nPatient: When I really thought about it, I realized that I have completed a lot of successful projects in the past. Just because I struggled with this one doesn't mean I'm useless overall. I also remembered that everyone has off days or moments where things don't go as planned.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Robert. You were able to recognize that one difficult experience doesn't define your overall worth or abilities. How did your emotions change after you challenged that initial thought?\n\nPatient: I still felt a bit frustrated, but the intensity of the feeling decreased. I didn't feel as down on myself as I did before.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight. Challenging our negative thoughts doesn't always make the associated emotions disappear completely, but it can help reduce their intensity and make them more manageable. You did a great job working through that thought record.\n\nPatient: Thanks, it felt good to be able to shift my perspective a bit. But I still struggle with these kinds of thoughts a lot, especially when it comes to my relationships with others.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, and we can definitely explore how these thoughts impact your relationships. Before we do, I want to introduce a concept that might be helpful in understanding why these thoughts keep coming up. Have you heard of the term \"core beliefs\" before?\n\nPatient: I think so, but I'm not entirely sure what it means.\n\nTherapist: Core beliefs are deeply held beliefs about ourselves, others, and the world around us. They often develop early in life and can be influenced by our experiences and the messages we receive from others. Core beliefs can be positive or negative, and they can have a big impact on how we interpret situations and events.\n\nFor example, if someone holds a core belief that they are unlovable, they might interpret a friend canceling plans as evidence that they're not important or valued. Even if there's evidence to the contrary, like the friend showing care and support in the past, the core belief can make it hard to see that evidence as valid.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. So you're saying that my feelings of worthlessness and guilt might be connected to a core belief?\n\nTherapist: It's possible. One way we can start to explore that is by using a technique called the \"downward arrow.\" It involves asking ourselves a series of questions to get to the deeper beliefs underlying our thoughts. Would you be willing to try that with the thought you shared earlier, about feeling useless because of the DIY project?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I'm open to trying it. What kind of questions would I ask myself?",
