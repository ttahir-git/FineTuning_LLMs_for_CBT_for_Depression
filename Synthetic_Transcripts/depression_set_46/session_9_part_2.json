  "transcript": "Therapist: You've been doing a great job practicing the techniques we've discussed, Robert. I want to acknowledge the effort you've been putting into this process. It's not easy to challenge long-standing thought patterns, but the progress you're making is evident.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's been tough, but I'm trying my best. I know I still have a long way to go, though.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point, Robert. Recovery is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Speaking of which, I'd like to spend some time reviewing the homework we discussed last session. How did you find practicing the modified worry time technique and thought records?\n\nPatient: The modified worry time technique has been helpful. I've been trying to set aside specific times to worry, and it's made me feel a bit more in control of my thoughts. The thought records have been more challenging, though. Sometimes it's hard to identify the evidence against my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the worry time technique has been beneficial for you. It's a great tool for managing anxious thoughts. As for the thought records, it's common to struggle with finding evidence against negative thoughts at first. It's a skill that develops with practice. Can you share an example of a thought record you found particularly challenging?\n\nPatient: Sure. The other day, I was working on a project and made a mistake. I immediately thought, \"I can't do anything right. I'm useless.\" When I tried to find evidence against that thought, all I could think of were past mistakes and failures.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Robert. When we're feeling down, it's easy to focus on evidence that supports our negative thoughts and discount evidence that contradicts them. This is called \"disqualifying the positive,\" and it's a common cognitive distortion. Let's work through this thought record together and see if we can find some evidence against the thought \"I can't do anything right. I'm useless.\"\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good.\n\nTherapist: First, let's look at the situation objectively. You made a mistake while working on a project. Does that mean you can't do anything right, or is it possible that everyone makes mistakes sometimes?\n\nPatient: I guess everyone makes mistakes. It's just hard to remember that when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Making a mistake doesn't mean you're useless. It means you're human. Now, can you think of any times when you've completed a project successfully or received positive feedback on your work?\n\nPatient: Well, I did finish a big project last month, and my friend said he was impressed with my work. And I've had other projects in the past that turned out well.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought \"I can't do anything right. I'm useless.\" You've had successes in the past, and you've received positive feedback on your work. It's important to give those experiences the weight they deserve, rather than discounting them because of one mistake.\n\nPatient: You're right. I guess I have had some successes, even if it doesn't always feel that way.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Robert. As you continue practicing thought records, try to look for evidence that contradicts your negative thoughts, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. Over time, it will get easier to recognize and challenge those thoughts.\n\nPatient: I'll keep trying. Thanks for helping me work through that example.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Robert. I'm here to support you as you develop these skills. Remember, challenging negative thoughts is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.",
