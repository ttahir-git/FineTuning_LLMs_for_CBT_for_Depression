  "transcript": "Patient: Thank you for acknowledging that. It hasn't been easy, but I know I need to do something to start feeling better.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Robert. I want to assure you that you've taken a significant step by being here today. As we continue our conversation, I'd like to explore more about your experiences with depression. You mentioned that you've been struggling with depression for quite some time. Can you tell me more about when you first started noticing these feelings and how they've progressed over time?\n\nPatient: I think it started when I was in the military. The stress and pressure really got to me, and I started feeling overwhelmed and down more often than not. But it wasn't until after my divorce and losing my job that it really hit me hard. The death of my brother just made everything worse.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like there have been several significant events in your life that have contributed to your depression. It's not uncommon for depression to develop gradually over time, often triggered by stressful life experiences. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed and down during your time in the military. Can you tell me more about what that was like for you?\n\nPatient: In the military, I felt like I was always under pressure to perform and meet expectations. I didn't feel like I had much control over my life, and that really wore me down. I started feeling hopeless and like I wasn't good enough, no matter how hard I tried.\n\nTherapist: Feeling a lack of control and hopelessness can be significant factors in the development of depression. It's understandable that those experiences in the military had a profound impact on you. And it sounds like those feelings intensified after your divorce and job loss, which are also major life stressors. How have your feelings of depression evolved since then?\n\nPatient: After my divorce and losing my job, I felt like a failure. I couldn't provide for my family anymore, and I felt like I had let everyone down. I started isolating myself more and more, and I lost interest in things I used to enjoy. The death of my brother just added to the weight of it all, and I started feeling like there was no point in trying anymore.\n\nTherapist: It's clear that these experiences have had a profound impact on your self-worth and sense of purpose. Feeling like a failure and losing interest in previously enjoyed activities are common symptoms of depression. I want to explore these feelings further with you, but I also want to acknowledge the strength you've shown in persevering through these challenges and seeking help now. As we continue our work together, we'll focus on helping you rebuild a sense of purpose and find ways to engage in meaningful activities again. I'm curious, though, about how your depression has affected your relationships with others, both family and friends. Can you tell me more about that?",
