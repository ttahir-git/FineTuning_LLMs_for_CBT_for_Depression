  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by taking a closer look at one of your thought records from the past week. Can you share an example of a situation that triggered some negative thoughts and emotions for you?\n\nPatient: Sure. A few days ago, I was supposed to meet up with an old friend for lunch, but I ended up canceling at the last minute. I just couldn't muster up the energy to go. Afterwards, I felt really guilty and down on myself.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Robert. Let's walk through the thought record together. What emotions did you experience after canceling the plans, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt guilty, probably around an 80. I also felt sad and disappointed in myself, maybe a 70.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so guilt at an 80 and sadness at a 70. Those are strong emotions. Now, what automatic thoughts went through your mind after you canceled the plans?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I'm a terrible friend. I keep letting people down.\" I also had the thought, \"I'll never be able to maintain relationships if I keep doing this.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound really distressing. Let's focus on the first one: \"I'm a terrible friend.\" What evidence did you find that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I keep canceling plans at the last minute. I feel like I'm not there for my friends when they need me. That's what a terrible friend would do, right?\n\nTherapist: I hear you. It's important to acknowledge that evidence. Now, let's look for evidence against that thought. What would an objective observer say about your friendship skills?\n\nPatient: I guess they might point out that I do try to make an effort when I can. I reach out to check on my friends, and I'm always there to listen when they need support. It's just the in-person plans that I struggle with.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Robert. It shows that there's more to being a good friend than just showing up for plans. You're acknowledging the efforts you do make in your friendships. Let's look at the second thought: \"I'll never be able to maintain relationships if I keep doing this.\" What evidence do you have against this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I have managed to maintain some long-term friendships, even with my struggles. And my friends have stuck by me, even when I've had to cancel on them. I guess that shows that relationships can withstand some challenges.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. That's a powerful piece of evidence against that negative thought. It suggests that your friendships are more resilient than you might think. Now, based on the evidence for and against, what's an alternative thought you could have in this situation?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"Canceling plans doesn't make me a terrible friend. I have other ways of showing up for my friends, and my relationships can handle some setbacks.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Robert. It acknowledges the challenges while also recognizing your strengths and the resilience of your friendships. If you believe that alternative thought, how intense are your emotions now, on that 0-100 scale?\n\nPatient: The guilt is probably down to a 50, and the sadness is around a 40.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant decrease in intensity. It shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing our emotions. By examining the evidence and finding alternative perspectives, we can shift our emotional experience.\n\nPatient: It's still a challenge to do this in the moment, but I can see how it helps.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, it takes practice to make this a habit. But you're making great progress, Robert. As we continue to work on these skills, it will become easier to catch those negative thoughts and reframe them in the moment.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and talk about your experience with the worry time technique. You mentioned that it's been helpful, but you struggle to stick to the designated time. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I find that even when I've set aside a specific time to worry, my mind still drifts back to those thoughts throughout the day. It's like I can't fully contain the worries to that designated time.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Robert. Our minds are skilled at latching onto worries, even when we're trying to set them aside. One strategy that can help is to have a \"worry postponement\" plan in place. When you notice worries outside of your designated time, gently remind yourself that you'll address them later and redirect your attention to the present moment. It takes practice, but over time, it can help train your mind to contain those worries.\n\nAnother helpful technique is to write down your worries as they come up during the day. Just a brief note to capture the thought. Then, during your designated worry time, you can review the list and address each worry systematically. This can help prevent the worries from spiraling out of control during the day.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of writing them down. It might help me feel like I'm acknowledging the worries without getting consumed by them in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's a way of validating your concerns while also setting boundaries around when and how you'll address them. It's all about finding that balance between acknowledging your thoughts and not letting them control you.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely give that a try. It's just hard to break out of that worry cycle sometimes.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it is a challenge. But every time you practice these techniques, you're building new mental habits. It's like exercising a muscle - the more you do it, the stronger it gets. And remember, you don't have to do this perfectly. Even small shifts in how you relate to your worries can make a big difference over time.\n\nNow, I want to make sure we have time to discuss the disconnection you've been feeling from your family. Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind around that?\n\nPatient: It's just hard being so far away from my kids. I feel like I'm missing out on their lives, and I worry that we're growing apart. I know they're busy with their own lives, but I can't help but feel a sense of loss.\n\nTherapist: That feeling of loss makes a lot of sense, Robert. It's natural to grieve the physical distance and the changes in your relationships. What have you been doing to cope with those feelings?\n\nPatient: Honestly, I've been trying to distract myself with projects around the house. But the feelings always seem to creep back in.\n\nTherapist: Distraction can be a helpful short-term coping strategy, but you're right that it doesn't address the underlying emotions. One thing that can be helpful is to find ways to maintain a sense of connection with your kids, even from a distance. Have you tried scheduling regular phone or video calls with them?\n\nPatient: We do talk on the phone occasionally, but it's not the same as seeing them in person. And sometimes I feel like I don't know what to say.",
