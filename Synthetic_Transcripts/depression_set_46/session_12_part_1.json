  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Robert, it's good to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please let me know if there's anything important I might be missing. With that said, how have you been since our last session? How has your mood been, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. My mood has been relatively stable, although I still have moments where I feel down or discouraged. I've been trying to keep up with the techniques we've discussed, like the modified worry time and thought records. It's been helpful to have those tools, but it's not always easy to put them into practice. One thing that's been on my mind is the bookshelf project we talked about last time. I've made some progress on it, but I've also been struggling with self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've found the techniques we've discussed helpful, even if it's not always easy to apply them. It's completely normal to have moments of self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy, especially when taking on new challenges like the bookshelf project. I'm proud of you for making progress on it despite those difficulties. Today, I'd like to focus on exploring those feelings further and see how we can work through them together. We can also discuss your experience with the modified worry time and thought records, and see if there are any adjustments we can make to better support you. How does that sound for our agenda today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I definitely want to talk more about the bookshelf project and the feelings that have come up around it. I also think it would be helpful to review the modified worry time and thought records, as I'm not sure I'm using them as effectively as I could be. There's one other thing I wanted to bring up - I had a bit of a falling out with a friend recently, and it's been weighing on me. I'm not sure if it's related to my depression, but I thought it might be worth discussing.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss the falling out with your friend and explore how it might be impacting your mental health. It's important that we address the things that are weighing on you, even if they don't seem directly related to your depression. Our agenda for today will be:\n1. Discuss your progress and challenges with the bookshelf project, focusing on the feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy that have come up.\n2. Review your experience with the modified worry time and thought records, and see if there are any adjustments we can make to better support you.\n3. Explore the falling out with your friend and how it might be impacting your mental health.\nDoes this agenda work for you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
