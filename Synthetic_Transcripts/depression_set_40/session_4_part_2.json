  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for CBT session 4 with Priya:\n\nPatient: One situation that comes to mind is when I received a negative performance review at work last week. I felt overwhelmed with feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness. I couldn't stop thinking about how I'm not good enough and how I'll never be able to succeed in my career.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Priya. Those thoughts and feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness can be incredibly overwhelming. Let's break down that situation using the CBT triangle. The situation or trigger was receiving the negative performance review. The emotions you identified were inadequacy and hopelessness. What automatic thoughts did you notice?\n\nPatient: I had thoughts like \"I'm not good enough,\" \"I'll never succeed,\" and \"I'm a failure.\"\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing those vulnerable thoughts, Priya. I want to introduce a distress tolerance technique called \"grounding\" that can help manage overwhelming emotions in moments like this. Grounding involves using your senses to connect with the present moment and distract yourself from intense emotions. One example is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. You identify 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. Would you like to practice this together now?\n\nPatient: Yes, I'm willing to try it. What do I do first?\n\nTherapist: First, take a deep breath. Now, look around the room and identify 5 things you can see. They can be anything - a picture on the wall, a piece of furniture, or even a spot on the ceiling.\n\nPatient: Okay, I see a plant in the corner, a bookshelf, a lamp, a rug, and a painting.\n\nTherapist: Great. Now, identify 4 things you can touch. It could be your clothing, the chair you're sitting on, or anything within reach.\n\nPatient: I can touch my shirt, the armrest of the chair, my hair, and the fabric of the couch.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. Next, identify 3 things you can hear. It might be the sound of traffic outside, the hum of the air conditioner, or even your own breathing.\n\nPatient: I hear the sound of cars passing by, the ticking of a clock, and a bird chirping outside.\n\nTherapist: You're doing great, Priya. Now, identify 2 things you can smell. It could be the scent of the room, any fragrance you're wearing, or even the smell of your own skin.\n\nPatient: I smell the scent of the candle in the room and a faint smell of coffee.\n\nTherapist: Almost there. Finally, identify 1 thing you can taste. It might be the taste of your last meal, a sip of water, or even your own breath.\n\nPatient: I can taste the mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.\n\nTherapist: Excellent work, Priya. How do you feel after practicing this grounding technique?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit more centered and less overwhelmed. It helped me focus on the present moment instead of getting lost in my thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. Grounding can be a powerful tool to manage intense emotions. I encourage you to practice this technique whenever you start to feel overwhelmed. In addition to grounding, another distress tolerance skill is deep breathing. Would you like to learn a deep breathing exercise?",
