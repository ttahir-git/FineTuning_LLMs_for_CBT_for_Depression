  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I think it covers the main things I've been struggling with lately. I don't have anything else to add at the moment.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your experience with the behavioral experiment of reaching out to two old friends. Can you tell me how it went and what you learned from it?\n\nPatient: It was definitely challenging for me to reach out, but I'm glad I did it. Both of my friends were really happy to hear from me and seemed genuinely interested in catching up. We ended up having some nice conversations, and it felt good to reconnect with them.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Priya. I'm glad you had a positive experience with the experiment. What did you learn about your core belief \"I'm not worthy of love and connection\" through this experience?\n\nPatient: I think it challenged that belief in a big way. It showed me that people do care about me and value our connection, even if we haven't been in touch for a while. It made me feel more hopeful about building and maintaining relationships.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Priya. It's so important to challenge those negative core beliefs with real-life experiences that provide evidence to the contrary. I'm curious, how did you feel emotionally after reconnecting with your friends?\n\nPatient: I felt a mix of emotions. I was happy and relieved that it went well, but I also felt a bit sad and regretful that I had let so much time pass without reaching out. It made me realize how much I miss having close friendships in my life.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel a range of emotions after an experience like that. It's great that you're able to identify and express those feelings. Let's talk more about the sadness and regret you mentioned. What thoughts were going through your mind when you felt those emotions?\n\nPatient: I was thinking about all the time I've lost with friends and how I've pushed people away over the years because of my depression and my belief that I'm not worthy of love and connection. It made me feel like I've missed out on a lot of potential happiness and support.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important realization, Priya. It shows that you're starting to see the impact of your negative beliefs on your life and relationships. It's okay to feel sadness and regret about the past, but it's also important to focus on what you can do differently moving forward. What do you think you might do differently now that you have this new awareness?\n\nPatient: I think I want to make more of an effort to stay connected with people and not let my negative beliefs hold me back. I want to prioritize friendships and relationships more, even if it feels scary or uncomfortable at times.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Priya. It takes courage to push past those fears and discomfort, but it's so worth it to have those meaningful connections in your life. Let's talk about some specific steps you can take to prioritize relationships and challenge that negative core belief. What are some small actions you can take in the coming week to build on the progress you've made with the behavioral experiment?\n\nPatient: I could reach out to a few more friends or family members, maybe even set up a time to meet in person if they're local. I could also look into joining a social group or club related to one of my interests, like photography or language learning.\n\nTherapist: Those are great ideas, Priya! Taking small, consistent steps like that can make a big difference over time in shifting your beliefs and building more positive relationships. I encourage you to choose one or two of those actions to focus on this week and pay attention to how it feels to challenge that old belief and prioritize connection.\n\nPatient: Okay, I will definitely do that. I'm feeling more motivated now to keep working on this.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that, Priya. Let's revisit this topic next week and see how it went. In the meantime, let's shift gears a bit and talk about the low mood you mentioned earlier. You said you've been feeling more tired than usual and having trouble motivating yourself to do things you normally enjoy. Can you tell me more about that?",
