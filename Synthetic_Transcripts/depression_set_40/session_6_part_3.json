  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's take a moment to consider some evidence against the thought \"I'm a failure, and I'll never be good enough at my job.\" Have you received any positive feedback or recognition for your work in the past?\n\nPatient: Well, I did receive a performance bonus last year for meeting my targets. And my colleagues often come to me for help when they're stuck on a problem.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're a failure and not good enough at your job. It shows that you've been recognized for your work performance and that your colleagues value your expertise. Let's think of an alternative thought that takes into account both the evidence for and against the original thought. What might be a more balanced perspective?\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought could be, \"I made a mistake, but that doesn't define my entire work performance. I've had successes in the past, and I have the skills to improve and learn from this experience.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent alternative thought, Priya. It acknowledges the mistake while also recognizing your past successes and your ability to grow and improve. Now, let's re-rate the intensity of the emotions you felt after considering this alternative thought. How intense are the feelings of embarrassment and shame now?\n\nPatient: They're still there, but not as strong. Maybe around 60 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in intensity, Priya. This shows how challenging our negative thoughts and considering alternative perspectives can help shift our emotional state. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to identify and challenge cognitive distortions in the moment.\n\nPatient: I can see how this could be helpful. It's just hard to remember to do it when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Priya. One strategy is to set aside a specific time each day to review your thoughts and complete a thought record. This can help you build the habit of examining your thoughts more objectively. Another helpful technique is to enlist the support of a trusted friend or family member. You can share your thought records with them and ask for their perspective on the evidence for and against your negative thoughts.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of setting aside a specific time each day. I could do it in the evening when I'm winding down before bed. And I have a close friend who I think would be willing to help me with this.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like great strategies, Priya. Remember, the more you practice these skills, the easier it will become to apply them in the moment when you're feeling distressed. I'd like to spend the rest of our session today exploring how your specific experiences, such as your military service and gender transition, may be connected to your intermediate and core beliefs. This can help us understand the roots of some of your negative thought patterns and develop more targeted interventions. Does that sound okay to you?",
