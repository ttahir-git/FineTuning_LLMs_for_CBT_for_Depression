  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like cognitive restructuring and behavioral experiments. It's been challenging at times, but I've also had moments of clarity and hope. I still struggle with feelings of sadness and disconnection, especially at work, but I'm trying to be more aware of my thoughts and how they influence my emotions and behaviors.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we've discussed, even though it hasn't been easy. Recognizing the connection between your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors is a crucial step in the process. Let's take a moment to explore your experiences since our last session. Can you share a specific situation where you found it challenging to manage your thoughts and emotions?\n\nPatient: One situation that stands out is a recent interaction with my supervisor at work. I made a small mistake on a project, and she pointed it out in front of my colleagues. I immediately felt a wave of shame and started thinking, \"I'm not good enough, and everyone must think I'm incompetent.\" It was difficult to focus on the rest of the meeting because I was so caught up in my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a challenging situation, and it's understandable that you felt overwhelmed by your negative thoughts. Let's break down this experience using the CBT triangle. The situation was your supervisor pointing out your mistake in front of your colleagues. Your thoughts were, \"I'm not good enough, and everyone must think I'm incompetent.\" And your emotions were shame and feeling overwhelmed. How did these thoughts and emotions influence your behavior during and after the meeting?\n\nPatient: During the meeting, I became quiet and withdrawn. I had trouble focusing on the rest of the discussion because I was so preoccupied with my negative thoughts. After the meeting, I avoided my colleagues and spent the rest of the day working alone in my office. I didn't want to face anyone because I felt like they were all judging me.\n\nTherapist: Your reaction to the situation is a great example of how our thoughts can influence our emotions and behaviors. The thought \"I'm not good enough\" led to feelings of shame, which then caused you to withdraw and avoid your colleagues. This is a common pattern that we'll continue to work on in our sessions. For today, let's set an agenda. What would you like to focus on in our session?\n\nPatient: I'd like to continue working on challenging my core belief \"I'm not worthy of love and connection.\" I've been trying to use the positive data log and behavioral experiments, but I still find myself falling into old patterns of thinking. I'd also like to discuss how I can better manage situations like the one with my supervisor, where I feel overwhelmed by negative thoughts and emotions.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. We can start by reviewing your positive data log and discussing any challenges you've faced in using it. Then, we can explore additional techniques for challenging your core belief, such as cognitive restructuring and reframing. We'll also discuss strategies for managing difficult situations at work, like the one you mentioned. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to learning more techniques to help me manage my thoughts and emotions, especially in challenging situations.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your positive data log. Can you share some of the entries you've made since our last session?",
