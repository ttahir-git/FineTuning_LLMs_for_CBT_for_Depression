  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week, but I've been trying to apply the techniques we've discussed. I wrote the self-compassionate letter as part of my homework, and it was an emotional experience. I'm starting to see how my core belief of not being worthy of love and connection has been influencing my thoughts and behaviors.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been applying the techniques and that the self-compassionate letter had an impact on you. It takes courage to confront deeply held beliefs. Can you share a bit more about your experience with the letter and any insights you gained?\n\nPatient: Writing the letter felt strange at first, but as I got into it, I found myself expressing emotions I usually keep buried. I realized that I rarely show myself the same kindness and understanding that I try to offer others. It made me wonder how much my core belief has been holding me back from truly connecting with people.\n\nTherapist: That's a powerful realization, Priya. Recognizing the discrepancy between how we treat ourselves and others can be a significant step towards self-compassion. Your core belief of not being worthy of love and connection seems to be a central theme in your experiences. Would you like to explore this further today?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I want to understand why I have this belief and how it's affecting my life.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's make that a priority for today's session. We can also review your progress with the thought records and reframing exercises. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: I've been struggling with reaching out for support, even though we discussed its importance last session. I think I could use some guidance on that.\n\nTherapist: Of course, we can definitely address that as well. So, our agenda for today includes:\n\n1. Exploring your core belief of not being worthy of love and connection\n2. Reviewing your progress with thought records and reframing\n3. Discussing strategies for reaching out for support\n\nDoes this sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that covers the main points I wanted to discuss.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's start by exploring your core belief. Can you think of a recent situation where this belief was triggered?",
