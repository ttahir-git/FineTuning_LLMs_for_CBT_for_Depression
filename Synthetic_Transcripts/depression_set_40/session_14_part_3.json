  "transcript": "Here is part 3 of 4 for CBT session 14 with Priya:\n\nPatient: I'm starting to see how this core belief has been holding me back in so many areas of my life. It's like I've been sabotaging myself without even realizing it.\n\nTherapist: That's a profound insight, Priya. Recognizing the impact of our core beliefs is a crucial step in the therapeutic process. Let's explore how this belief may have influenced your behavior, particularly when it comes to reaching out for support.\n\nPatient: I've always had a hard time asking for help. I worry that I'll be seen as weak or needy. It feels safer to just deal with things on my own, even if it means struggling in silence.\n\nTherapist: That's a common concern for many people who hold the belief that they're not worthy of love and connection. They fear that reaching out will lead to rejection or judgment. However, this belief often leads to self-isolation and can exacerbate feelings of depression. Can you think of a time when you could have benefited from reaching out for support but didn't?\n\nPatient: Just last week, I was really struggling with some intense emotions related to my transition. I thought about calling a friend from my support group, but I talked myself out of it. I told myself they probably wouldn't understand or would be tired of hearing about my problems.\n\nTherapist: Let's examine that thought using the evidence-based approach we've been practicing. What evidence do you have that your friend wouldn't understand or would be tired of hearing about your problems?\n\nPatient: Well, I don't have any concrete evidence. It's more of a fear based on past experiences with people who weren't supportive.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point. Our past experiences can heavily influence our thoughts and beliefs, even when they don't apply to our current situation. What evidence do you have that your friend from the support group would be understanding and willing to listen?\n\nPatient: We've been through a lot together, and they've always been there for me in the past. They've shared their own struggles with me, too.\n\nTherapist: So, it sounds like you have more evidence to support the idea that your friend would be understanding and supportive. Let's reframe your initial thought. Instead of assuming they wouldn't understand or would be tired of hearing about your problems, what would be a more balanced and adaptive thought?\n\nPatient: I could tell myself, \"My friend has been supportive in the past, and it's okay to reach out when I need help. They might be glad I trusted them enough to share what I'm going through.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Priya. It acknowledges your friend's past support and the potential benefits of reaching out. As we continue to challenge your core belief, it's essential to practice reframing in moments like these. Remember, reaching out for support is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes courage to be vulnerable and ask for help when we need it.\n\nPatient: I'm starting to see that now. It's just hard to break old habits and push through the fear.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's why we practice. Each time you challenge your core belief and reach out for support, you're taking a step towards building more meaningful connections and improving your mental well-being. Let's discuss some specific strategies for reaching out and communicating your needs effectively.",
