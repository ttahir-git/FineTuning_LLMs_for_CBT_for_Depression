  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 15. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel that you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, which can be an important aspect of therapy. With all that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I tried reaching out to a friend for support, like we discussed, and it went better than I expected. They were really understanding and helpful. I've also been practicing the thought records and reframing techniques, but I'm still struggling with the core belief that I'm not worthy of love and connection.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that reaching out to your friend went well. That's a big step forward in challenging your core belief. It's also great that you've been practicing the thought records and reframing techniques. It's normal to still struggle with deeply held beliefs, even as you make progress. Would you like to focus on that core belief in our session today?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I feel like it's at the root of a lot of my struggles.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely focus on that. Let's set an agenda for our session today. I'd like to start by exploring your experience with reaching out to your friend and how that relates to your core belief. Then, we can dive deeper into the core belief itself and introduce some additional techniques for challenging it. We can also discuss your progress with the thought records and reframing, and address any challenges or successes you've had since our last session. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm looking forward to working on this core belief and learning some new techniques.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start with your experience of reaching out to your friend. Can you tell me more about what happened and how it made you feel?",
