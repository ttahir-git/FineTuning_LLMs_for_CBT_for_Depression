  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our sixth session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever feel that you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted friend or family member. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like facial expressions or body language.\n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in any way I can. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last session. It's helpful to see the progress we've made so far and the areas we need to focus on. Before we set an agenda for today, I'd like to check in with you. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?",
