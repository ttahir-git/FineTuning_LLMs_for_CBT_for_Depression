  "transcript": "Patient: Some early warning signs for me might be isolating myself more, having trouble sleeping, or feeling more irritable than usual.\n\nTherapist: Those are great insights, Priya. Recognizing these early warning signs can help you take action sooner to prevent a more severe depressive episode. What are some strategies you can use when you notice these signs?\n\nPatient: I could try reaching out to a friend, even if it's just a quick text. Or I could do some of the self-care activities we've talked about, like going for a walk or doing a photography project.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent strategies, Priya. Reaching out for support and engaging in self-care activities can be very helpful in managing your symptoms. Another important part of relapse prevention planning is identifying your personal strengths and resources. What do you feel are some of your strengths that can help you maintain your progress?\n\nPatient: I think my creativity is a strength. When I'm feeling down, doing something creative like photography or learning a new language can help me feel more engaged and purposeful.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, your creativity is a valuable resource. Engaging in activities that bring you a sense of purpose and accomplishment can boost your mood and resilience. Another resource we've discussed is your support system. I know it can be challenging to reach out, but having people you can turn to for support is crucial. What are some small steps you can take to nurture your relationships?\n\nPatient: I could make a goal to reach out to one friend each week, even if it's just a short conversation. And maybe I could join a local LGBTQ+ support group to meet new people who might understand what I'm going through.\n\nTherapist: Those are great ideas, Priya. Setting small, achievable goals for connecting with others can help you build momentum and feel more confident in your relationships. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. Your friends and support systems are there for you, and reaching out is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I need to remind myself that asking for help isn't a burden, it's a way of taking care of myself.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Priya. You deserve support and connection, just like everyone else. As we continue to work on challenging your core belief, it will become easier to internalize this truth. I want to introduce another tool that can help you maintain your progress after our sessions end. It's called a coping card. A coping card is a small, portable reminder of your new, adaptive thoughts and beliefs. You can write down some of the balanced thoughts we've come up with together, or some affirmations that resonate with you. Then, when you're feeling challenged, you can pull out your coping card and remind yourself of these more helpful thoughts. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's like having a little piece of therapy with me wherever I go.\n\nTherapist: That's a great way to put it, Priya. Having a tangible reminder of your new thoughts and beliefs can be very powerful. Why don't we take a few minutes now to create a coping card together? What's one new, adaptive thought you'd like to include on your card?",
