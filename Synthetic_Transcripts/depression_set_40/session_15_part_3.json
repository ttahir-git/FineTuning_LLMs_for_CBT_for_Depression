  "transcript": "Patient: That makes sense. I like the idea of having a specific time each day to reflect on my experiences and look for evidence against my core belief. It feels more manageable than trying to do it all the time.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Setting aside a specific time can make it feel more manageable and help you build a consistent habit. And remember, the evidence doesn't have to be anything big or dramatic. Even small moments of connection or kindness can be powerful challenges to the core belief.\n\nPatient: I have a question about the Positive Data Log. What if I have a day where I can't think of any evidence against my core belief? Like, what if nothing good happens that day?\n\nTherapist: That's a great question. There might be days where it's harder to find evidence against your core belief. On those days, it can be helpful to think about any experiences that might contradict your core belief, even if they're not directly related to love and connection. For example, maybe you accomplished something at work that day, or took care of yourself in some way. Those experiences can still be evidence against the core belief, because they suggest that you have value and worth, even if it's not in the context of a relationship.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I can see how even small things, like taking care of myself or doing well at work, could be evidence against my core belief.\n\nTherapist: Definitely. And if you have a day where you really can't think of any evidence against your core belief, that's okay too. The goal isn't to be perfect or to always find evidence against the core belief. The goal is to start building a habit of looking for evidence and challenging the core belief when you can.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I feel like I have a better understanding of how to do the Positive Data Log now.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Before we move on, I want to check in with how you're feeling. We've been talking about some heavy stuff today, and I want to make sure you're doing okay.\n\nPatient: I'm doing alright. It's not easy to talk about this stuff, but it feels good to be working on it. I feel like I'm making progress, even if it's slow sometimes.\n\nTherapist: I'm really glad to hear that you feel like you're making progress. Slow progress is still progress, and it's important to celebrate the small victories along the way. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you. That means a lot to me.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. Let's talk a bit more about how the Positive Data Log relates to the other techniques we've been working on, like the thought records and reframing. The thought records and reframing are great tools for challenging negative thoughts in the moment, or shortly after they happen. The Positive Data Log is a way to build up a more general sense of yourself as worthy of love and connection, by accumulating evidence over time. The two techniques can work together to help you challenge your core belief in different ways.",
