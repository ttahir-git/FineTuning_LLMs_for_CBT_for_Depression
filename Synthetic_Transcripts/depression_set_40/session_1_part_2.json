  "transcript": "Therapist: Priya, I want to delve a bit deeper into your experiences with depression. You mentioned that your symptoms first emerged during your military service in Sri Lanka. Can you tell me more about that time in your life and how it might have contributed to your current struggles?\n\nPatient: My time in the military was very difficult. I witnessed a lot of violence and suffering during the war, and I lost some close friends. I think the trauma from those experiences has stayed with me, and I often feel guilty for surviving when others didn't.\n\nTherapist: It's clear that your military service had a profound impact on you, and it's common for traumatic experiences to contribute to depression. The feelings of guilt and loss you described can be very heavy burdens to carry. How have you coped with these emotions over the years?\n\nPatient: I've mostly tried to push them aside and focus on other things, like my work or my transition. But lately, I've been finding it harder to ignore the memories and the pain they bring up.\n\nTherapist: Avoidance is a common coping mechanism, but as you've experienced, it's not a long-term solution. In our work together, we'll explore healthier ways to process and manage these difficult emotions. You also mentioned that your depression worsened after moving to the United States and beginning your gender transition. Can you tell me more about how these experiences have affected your mental health?\n\nPatient: Moving to a new country was a big adjustment, and I felt very isolated at first. I didn't have a strong support system, and I faced a lot of discrimination, both for being an immigrant and for being transgender. My transition has been a long and challenging journey, and I often feel like I don't quite fit in anywhere.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stress and uncertainty, on top of the everyday challenges of navigating a new culture and identity. It's understandable that these experiences would take a toll on your mental health. I want to acknowledge the strength and resilience you've shown in the face of these difficulties. It takes a lot of courage to embark on a journey of self-discovery and authenticity, especially in the face of adversity.\n\nPatient: Thank you. It's been a difficult road, but I know I'm on the right path, even if it doesn't always feel that way.\n\nTherapist: That's a very insightful perspective, Priya. Recognizing that progress isn't always linear and that setbacks are a normal part of growth is an important part of the therapeutic process. As we continue to explore your experiences and emotions, we'll work on developing tools and strategies to help you navigate the challenges that arise.",
