  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your experience with the behavioral experiment and other homework assignments from our last session. Can you share how it went when you tried reaching out to a friend?\n\nPatient: Well, as I mentioned earlier, I couldn't bring myself to actually reach out. I kept thinking about how I might be bothering them or that they wouldn't want to hear from me.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Priya. Let's explore this further. What thoughts were going through your mind when you considered reaching out?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"They probably don't want to talk to me,\" and \"I'm just going to be a burden to them.\"\n\nTherapist: These thoughts are closely tied to your core belief, \"I'm not worthy of love and connection.\" Let's challenge these thoughts using the CBT triangle. Can you identify the emotions and behaviors associated with these thoughts?\n\nPatient: I felt anxious and sad. I ended up isolating myself and not reaching out, which I know isn't helpful.\n\nTherapist: You're right, isolation can maintain the negative cycle. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that your friends don't want to talk to you or that you'd be a burden?\n\nPatient: Well, I don't have any concrete evidence. It's more of a feeling.\n\nTherapist: That's a good insight. Feelings can be powerful, but they're not always based on facts. What evidence do you have against these thoughts?\n\nPatient: My friends have told me that they care about me and want to support me. They've reached out to me in the past to check in.\n\nTherapist: That's important evidence to consider. Based on this, can you come up with a more balanced thought?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"My friends care about me and want to support me, even if I feel like I'm bothering them sometimes.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great balanced thought, Priya. How do you feel when you consider this thought?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit lighter and more hopeful. It makes me think that maybe it's worth trying to reach out again.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Challenging these negative thoughts and considering alternative perspectives can help break the cycle of negative emotions and behaviors. Remember, it's okay to start small. You don't have to dive into a deep conversation right away. Even a simple text to say hello can be a step in the right direction.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I can start with something small and see how it goes.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And as we continue to work on challenging your core belief, it will become easier to reach out and connect with others. Speaking of your core belief, I want to introduce the concept of relapse prevention planning. This is a way to help you maintain your progress after our sessions end. One important part of this is identifying early warning signs that your depression symptoms might be returning. What do you think some of your early warning signs might be?",
