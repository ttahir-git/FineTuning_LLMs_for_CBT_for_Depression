  "transcript": "Patient: I think I'd like to focus on the challenges I've been facing at work. It's been difficult to apply the coping strategies in the moment, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed or triggered by something someone says or does.\n\nTherapist: That's a great topic to focus on today. Work stress can be a significant challenge, and it's understandable that it's been difficult to apply the coping strategies in those moments. Can you tell me about a specific situation that was particularly challenging for you recently?\n\nPatient: Last week, my supervisor made a comment about my transition in front of some of my coworkers. It wasn't overtly negative, but it felt like a microaggression. I could feel myself getting angry and defensive, but I didn't know how to respond in the moment. I ended up just walking away and avoiding everyone for the rest of the day.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a really difficult and painful experience. It's not surprising that you felt angry and defensive in response to a comment that felt like a microaggression. Avoidance is a common coping strategy, but as we've discussed before, it can sometimes reinforce negative thoughts and beliefs. Let's explore this situation a bit further. What thoughts were going through your mind after your supervisor made that comment?\n\nPatient: I was thinking things like, \"They don't really accept me here,\" and \"I'll never be able to be my true self at work.\" I also had thoughts like, \"I should just quit and find a new job where I can be myself.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are really important thoughts to pay attention to. They're likely connected to some of the core beliefs we've been working on, like \"I'm not worthy of love and connection.\" When we have thoughts like that, it can trigger strong emotions and lead to behaviors like avoidance. Let's try to break this down using a thought record. We can start with the situation: your supervisor made a comment that felt like a microaggression. What emotions did you notice in that moment, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt angry, maybe at an 80. I also felt sad and hopeless, maybe around a 60.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so anger at an 80 and sadness and hopelessness around a 60. Those are really intense emotions. And the thoughts you noticed were \"They don't really accept me here,\" \"I'll never be able to be my true self at work,\" and \"I should just quit and find a new job where I can be myself.\" Is that right?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\n\nTherapist: Let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the thought \"They don't really accept me here\"?\n\nPatient: Well, my supervisor made that comment, and no one else spoke up to challenge it. And I've noticed other microaggressions in the past, like people using the wrong pronouns or making jokes about trans people.\n\nTherapist: That's important evidence to consider. Those experiences can definitely contribute to feeling like you're not accepted. Now let's look at the evidence against that thought. Have there been any times when you've felt accepted or supported at work?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been a few times. One of my coworkers invited me to lunch last month and asked me about my transition in a really supportive way. And my supervisor did apologize after making that comment, even though it still hurt.\n\nTherapist: So there's some evidence on both sides. It's not all or nothing. Even though there have been some painful experiences, there have also been moments of support and acceptance. Now let's look at the thought \"I'll never be able to be my true self at work.\" What evidence do you have for that thought?\n\nPatient: I just feel like I have to hide parts of myself to fit in and avoid conflict. I don't talk about my personal life much, and I try to avoid any topics related to being trans.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense, and it's a common experience for people who are part of marginalized communities. But let's look at the evidence against that thought. Have there been any times when you've been able to be your true self at work, even in small ways?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been moments. Like when I wear clothes that make me feel more like myself, or when I've shared a little bit about my weekend plans with ",
