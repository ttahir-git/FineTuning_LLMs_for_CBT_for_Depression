  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our 12th session together. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, so I rely on your input to understand your experiences and progress. Additionally, while I strive to provide accurate and helpful information, there's always a possibility that I may generate something inaccurate or unhelpful. Please feel free to correct me or ask for clarification if anything doesn't seem quite right. Also, as an AI, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services in your area. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm not able to observe or interpret non-verbal cues like body language or tone of voice. If there's anything important that I might be missing due to this limitation, please let me know. With all that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards improved mental health and well-being. How are you feeling today? How have things been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminders about your limitations as an AI therapist. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about that. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the thought records and behavioral experiments. I wrote the self-compassionate letter to myself, and it was a challenging but meaningful exercise. I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and ability to manage negative thoughts, but it's still a work in progress. Work has been stressful lately, and I've had a few instances where I struggled to apply the coping strategies in the moment.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed and that you found the self-compassionate letter writing exercise meaningful. Small improvements are still progress, and it's normal for it to be a gradual process. I appreciate you sharing about the challenges you've faced at work. It can be difficult to apply new coping strategies in the moment, especially in stressful situations. We can definitely explore that further today. Before we dive in, let's take a moment to set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize today? We could discuss your experience with the homework, explore any challenges or successes you've had at work, or continue working on challenging the core belief \"I'm not worthy of love and connection.\" What feels most important to you right now?",
