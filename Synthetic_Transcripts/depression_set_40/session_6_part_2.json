  "transcript": "Patient: Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the grounding technique and deep breathing exercise when I feel overwhelmed. It's been challenging to remember to do them in the moment, but when I do, I notice that it helps a bit. I also tried to engage in some pleasant activities, like going for a walk in the park and calling a friend. It felt good to connect with someone, but I still find it hard to motivate myself to do these things regularly.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the grounding technique and deep breathing exercise, Priya. It's normal to find it challenging to remember to use these techniques in the moment, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. With practice, it will become easier to incorporate them into your daily life. I'm also glad to hear that you engaged in some pleasant activities and connected with a friend. Building and maintaining social connections is an important part of managing depression. Can you tell me more about the challenges you faced in motivating yourself to engage in these activities?\n\nPatient: Well, I often feel tired after work, and the thought of doing anything else feels exhausting. I also worry that I won't enjoy the activity or that it won't help me feel better. Sometimes, I get stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts, like \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I don't deserve to feel happy.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Priya. It's common for people with depression to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation. The negative thoughts you mentioned, such as \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I don't deserve to feel happy,\" are examples of cognitive distortions. These distortions can make it difficult to engage in activities that might help improve your mood. Let's explore these thoughts further using a thought record. Have you had a chance to complete any thought records since our last session?\n\nPatient: I did try to complete a thought record once or twice, but I found it challenging to identify the evidence for and against my negative thoughts. I kept getting stuck on the negative thoughts and couldn't think of any alternative perspectives.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Priya. Identifying evidence against negative thoughts can be difficult, especially when you're feeling depressed. Let's work through an example together, and I'll help you brainstorm some alternative perspectives. Can you think of a specific situation in the past week where you had a strong negative thought?\n\nPatient: Yes, a few days ago, I made a mistake at work, and my supervisor pointed it out in front of my colleagues. I immediately thought, \"I'm a failure, and I'll never be good enough at my job.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's use that situation as an example. We'll start by identifying the emotion you felt and rating its intensity on a scale of 0-100. What emotion did you feel in that moment, and how intense was it?\n\nPatient: I felt embarrassed and ashamed. I would say the intensity was around 85 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Priya. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm a failure, and I'll never be good enough at my job.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I made a mistake, and my supervisor called me out on it in front of everyone. I also haven't been performing as well at work lately due to my depression.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against this thought?",
