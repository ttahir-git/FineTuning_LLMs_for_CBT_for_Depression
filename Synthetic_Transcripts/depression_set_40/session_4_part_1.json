  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our fourth session. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the thought recording technique we discussed. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small changes in my mood and how I react to situations.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Priya. Even small changes can be significant steps towards progress. Can you tell me more about your experience with the thought recording homework? What challenges did you face, and how did you work through them?\n\nPatient: Well, I found it difficult to identify my thoughts and emotions in the moment. I often realized them only after the situation had passed. But when I did manage to catch them, I tried to challenge the negative thoughts like we practiced. It didn't always work, but there were times when I felt a little better afterwards.\n\nTherapist: Recognizing thoughts and emotions after the fact is a common experience, and it's a good start. With more practice, it will become easier to identify them in the moment. I'm glad to hear that challenging your negative thoughts has provided some relief, even if it's not always consistent. Remember, it's a skill that develops over time.\n\nPatient: Yes, I understand. I just wish I could see more progress faster. I still feel sad and hopeless quite often.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to want faster progress, but it's essential to be patient with yourself. Recovery is a gradual process, and every small step counts. Today, I'd like to introduce some additional techniques that can help you manage overwhelming emotions and engage in activities that promote a sense of well-being. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm open to trying new techniques.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by setting an agenda for today's session. We can review your thought records, discuss your experiences with the homework, and explore how your specific challenges relate to your thinking patterns and coping strategies. I'd also like to introduce distress tolerance techniques and behavioral activation. Does this agenda work for you, or is there anything else you'd like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: The agenda sounds good to me. I'm particularly interested in learning about distress tolerance techniques, as I often feel overwhelmed by my emotions.\n\nTherapist: That's a great priority, Priya. We'll definitely focus on distress tolerance techniques today. Before we dive in, let's explore a bit more about the overwhelming emotions you mentioned. Can you give me an example of a situation where you felt overwhelmed, and how it impacted your thoughts and behaviors?",
