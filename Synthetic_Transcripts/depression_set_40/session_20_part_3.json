  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great insights today, Priya. I want to acknowledge the hard work you've been putting into challenging these negative thoughts and beliefs. It's not an easy process, but you're making significant progress.\n\nPatient: Thank you, it feels good to hear that. I know I still have a lot of work to do, but I'm starting to see some changes.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's something to celebrate! As we've discussed, change is a gradual process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. I want to introduce a new concept today that can help you continue to build on the skills you've been practicing. It's called a meta-thought record.\n\nPatient: Okay, what's that?\n\nTherapist: A meta-thought record is similar to the thought records we've been using, but instead of focusing on a specific situation or thought, it looks at your overall experience with CBT and the progress you've made. It's a way to examine any thoughts or beliefs you have about the therapy process itself and to challenge any negative or unhelpful thoughts that might be getting in the way of your progress.\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. How does it work?\n\nTherapist: We'll start by identifying any thoughts or beliefs you have about CBT or your ability to make changes. For example, you might have a thought like \"I'm not sure I can keep up with these skills after therapy ends\" or \"I should be further along in my progress by now.\" We'll write down those thoughts and then examine the evidence for and against them, just like we've been doing with the regular thought records.\n\nPatient: I think I have some thoughts like that. Like, sometimes I worry that I won't be able to keep using these skills when I'm not coming to therapy anymore.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of a thought we can explore with a meta-thought record. Let's write that down and look at the evidence. What evidence do you have that you won't be able to keep using these skills after therapy?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I've been relying on our sessions to help me stay on track and practice the skills.\n\nTherapist: That's true, our sessions have been a source of support and accountability. But what about the times in between sessions? Have you been able to use the skills on your own at all?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I have. I've been doing the thought records and trying to challenge my thoughts, even when I'm not here.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence that you can use these skills independently! And we've been working on gradually tapering our sessions to help you build more confidence in using the skills on your own. What's some other evidence that you can keep using these skills after therapy?\n\nPatient: I guess the fact that I've been seeing some progress, even if it's slow. That shows that the skills are working, and I'm able to use them.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! The progress you've made is a direct result of the hard work you've been putting in, both in and out of our sessions. That's strong evidence that you have the ability to continue using these skills and making progress, even after therapy ends. Based on that evidence, what's a more balanced thought you could have about your ability to use CBT skills independently?\n\nPatient: I could think something like \"I've been able to use these skills on my own before, and I've made progress. That shows that I can keep using them even when I'm not in therapy.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more helpful and adaptive thought! And it's based on real evidence from your own experience. This is the kind of thought we want to practice and reinforce. As we continue to work together, we'll keep using meta-thought records to examine any doubts or concerns that come up about the therapy process. The goal is to build your confidence in your own abilities and to help you become your own therapist.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It feels empowering to know that I can keep making progress on my own.\n\nTherapist: It is empowering! And it's something you've already been doing, even if you haven't realized it. Every time you challenge a negative thought or use a coping skill, you're taking a step towards becoming your own therapist. As we move towards the end of our work together, we'll focus more and more on helping you internalize these skills and trust in your own abilities.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'm looking forward to continuing this work and seeing where I can go with it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude to have! I'm excited to see where you go with it too. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. But as long as you keep practicing these skills and challenging those negative thoughts, you'll keep moving in the right direction.\n\nPatient: Thank you, that's really encouraging to hear.",
