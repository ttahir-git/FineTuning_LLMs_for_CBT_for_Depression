  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 8. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week, but I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed. I completed a thought record each day and reached out to a friend, which was helpful. However, I still find it hard to shake off the feelings of sadness and disconnection.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Priya. It's great that you've been practicing the techniques and reaching out for support. Coping with depression is a process, and it's normal to have ups and downs. Today, I'd like to focus on exploring the connection between your experiences and your intermediate and core beliefs. We can also introduce some additional cognitive restructuring techniques. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm curious to understand more about how my beliefs are influencing my thoughts and feelings.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by setting an agenda for today's session. We can:\n\n1. Review your experience with the homework and discuss any challenges you faced.\n2. Explore the connection between your experiences and your intermediate and core beliefs.\n3. Introduce additional cognitive restructuring techniques, such as the downward arrow technique and behavioral experiments.\n4. Discuss the role of behavioral experiments in testing beliefs.\n\nDoes this agenda work for you, or is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: The agenda looks good to me. I'm particularly interested in learning about the downward arrow technique and behavioral experiments.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful! We'll make sure to cover those techniques in detail. Before we move on, let's take a moment to check in on your emotional state. How are you feeling right now, and how has your mood been since our last session?",
