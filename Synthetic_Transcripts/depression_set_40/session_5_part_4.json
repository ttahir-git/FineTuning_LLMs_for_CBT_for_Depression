  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in with you about your current mood and any final thoughts you have.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also hopeful. Today's session has given me a lot to think about, and I'm looking forward to practicing these new skills.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling hopeful, Priya. Remember that it's normal to feel tired after engaging in this type of work. Therapy can be emotionally taxing, so make sure to take care of yourself and engage in self-care activities after our sessions.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the grounding technique and deep breathing exercise when you feel overwhelmed. Also, keep engaging in the pleasant activities we discussed and monitor your mood. Additionally, I want you to start using the thought record to identify and challenge cognitive distortions, like we did today. Try to complete at least one thought record per day, focusing on situations where you notice strong emotions or unhelpful thoughts.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll make sure to practice the techniques and complete the thought records.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, the more you practice these skills, the more natural they'll become. If you have any questions or concerns while working on your homework, feel free to bring them up in our next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Reviewed Priya's experience with the homework from the previous session, discussing challenges and progress.\n- Continued building on distress tolerance techniques (grounding and deep breathing) and behavioral activation strategies.\n- Explored how Priya's specific experiences (military service and gender transition) relate to her thought patterns and coping strategies.\n- Identified and challenged cognitive distortions, particularly \"fortune telling,\" using the CBT triangle and evidence-based reasoning.\n- Introduced thought records and provided a detailed explanation and example of how to complete them.\n- Checked in with Priya about her current mood and final thoughts.
