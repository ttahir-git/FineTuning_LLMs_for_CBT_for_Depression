  "transcript": "Patient: The self-compassion practice has been a bit easier for me. I've been trying to use the phrases we came up with, like \"I'm doing the best I can\" and \"Everyone struggles sometimes.\" It does help a little bit when I'm feeling down on myself.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Jamie. Practicing self-compassion can be really helpful in reducing self-criticism and increasing self-acceptance. It's okay if it feels a bit awkward or uncomfortable at first \u2013 that's normal. The more you practice, the more natural it will feel. Remember to use these phrases even when you're not feeling particularly distressed. It's kind of like building a muscle \u2013 the more you use it, the stronger it gets.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I've been trying to remind myself of that. It's just hard sometimes when I'm in the moment and feeling really overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: I understand, Jamie. That's why we're going to work on some strategies to help you remember and apply these coping techniques when you're feeling overwhelmed. One strategy that can be helpful is to create a coping card. This is a small card that you can keep with you \u2013 in your wallet, purse, or pocket \u2013 that has some reminders of the coping techniques we've been working on. For example, on one side of the card, you could write down your go-to grounding phrase, like \"This feeling will pass\" or \"I'm doing the best I can.\" On the other side, you could write down a few self-compassionate phrases, like the ones we just discussed. That way, when you're feeling overwhelmed, you can pull out the card and have a physical reminder of these techniques.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I think having a physical reminder would be helpful for me.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's create a coping card together now. What would you like to write on each side of the card?\n\nPatient: On one side, I'll write my grounding phrase: \"This feeling will pass.\" On the other side, I'll write two self-compassionate phrases: \"I'm doing the best I can\" and \"Everyone struggles sometimes.\"\n\nTherapist: That sounds perfect, Jamie. Remember to keep this card with you and pull it out whenever you're feeling overwhelmed. It can be a helpful reminder to use these coping techniques in the moment. Another strategy that can be helpful is to practice these techniques when you're not feeling overwhelmed. That way, they become more automatic and easier to access when you do feel overwhelmed. For example, you could set aside a few minutes each day to practice your grounding phrase and self-compassionate phrases, even if you're not feeling particularly distressed. This can help build the habit and make it easier to remember and apply these techniques when you need them most.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to set aside some time each day to practice, even if I'm not feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Jamie. The more you practice, the easier it will become. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about building deeper connections with others. You mentioned earlier that you often feel like you're not interesting or likable enough for people to want to connect with you. This is a common concern for many people, and it's something we can work on together. One strategy that can be helpful is to challenge this negative core belief and reframe it in a more balanced way. For example, instead of thinking \"I'm not interesting or likable enough,\" you could reframe it as \"I have unique qualities and interests that some people find engaging, even if I don't connect with everyone.\" What do you think about that reframe?",
