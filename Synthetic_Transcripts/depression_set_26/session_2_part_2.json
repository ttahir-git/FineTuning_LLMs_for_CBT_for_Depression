  "transcript": "Patient: Yes, I completed the thought record. One recurring negative thought was \"I'll never make real friends in this city.\" The evidence supporting this thought is that I've been here for two years and still haven't formed close friendships. But contradicting evidence is that I have made some connections online through language learning communities.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Jamie. You've identified a common cognitive distortion called \"all-or-nothing thinking\" or \"black-and-white thinking.\" This is when we view situations in extreme, absolute terms without considering the nuances or middle ground. In your case, the belief that you'll \"never\" make real friends ignores the progress you've made in connecting with people online. Let's explore this further. What do you think are some other cognitive distortions that might be contributing to your negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: Well, I often feel like I'm not good enough or that I'm a failure because I had to leave college and take a blue-collar job. I compare myself to my old friends who have successful careers and families.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you might be experiencing \"disqualifying the positive\" and \"mental filter.\" Disqualifying the positive is when you dismiss your accomplishments or positive qualities as unimportant. Mental filter is when you focus exclusively on the negative aspects of a situation while ignoring the positive. For example, you're focusing on the fact that you left college and have a blue-collar job, but you're not giving yourself credit for the courage it took to move to a new city and the hard work you put in to support your family. Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, I guess I do tend to focus on the negative and dismiss my own strengths and accomplishments. I never really thought about it that way before.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Recognizing these cognitive distortions is an important step in CBT. Once we identify them, we can start to challenge and reframe these negative thoughts. For example, instead of thinking \"I'm a failure because I left college,\" you could reframe it as \"I made a difficult decision to prioritize my family's needs, and I'm proud of myself for taking on that responsibility.\" How does that sound?\n\nPatient: It sounds good in theory, but it's hard to change the way I think after so many years.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it does take practice and effort to change long-standing thought patterns. But the good news is that CBT provides us with tools and techniques to do just that. One technique we can use is called \"Socratic questioning.\" This involves asking yourself questions to challenge your negative thoughts and consider alternative perspectives. For example, you might ask yourself, \"Is it really true that I'm a failure just because I left college? What would I say to a friend who was in a similar situation?\" By questioning your thoughts in this way, you can start to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective. Would you like to try this technique together now?",
