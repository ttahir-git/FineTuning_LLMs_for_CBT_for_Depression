  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for CBT session 19 with Jamie:\n\nPatient: At the meetup, I was really nervous at first. I almost didn't go in. But I reminded myself that attending was a way of challenging my negative thoughts and taking a step towards my goals. \n\nTherapist: That's great that you were able to push through the initial anxiety and challenge those negative thoughts. What happened once you went inside?\n\nPatient: I ended up having a good conversation with a couple people. We talked about our shared interest in languages. I even practiced a little vulnerability like we discussed, and shared about my background and recent move. People seemed interested and supportive.\n\nTherapist: That's a big step forward, Jamie. You faced your anxiety, engaged with others, and even opened up a bit. How did it feel to share more about yourself?\n\nPatient: It was scary but also a relief. I realized people weren't judging me as harshly as I imagined. Some even related to my experience. It made me feel less alone.\n\nTherapist: That's a valuable insight. Challenging your negative predictions and being vulnerable can lead to more connection and support. Let's add this to your thought record - the prediction that people would judge you, the experiment of sharing about yourself, and the outcome that people were actually supportive. This can help counter that negative core belief about not being likable.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I do feel a little more hopeful seeing it laid out like that. But I worry I won't be able to keep this up. What if I have a string of bad days and lose motivation again?\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern. Recovery isn't always a straight line. There will be ups and downs. That's why we're working on building your toolbox of coping strategies. On those harder days, what usually goes through your mind? What thoughts make it tough to use your skills?\n\nPatient: I have thoughts like \"This is pointless, I'll never get better.\" \"I'm too tired to try.\" \"I don't deserve to feel better.\" It's like a heavy weight that makes it hard to move.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts can be so overwhelming and paralyzing. Let's look at them more closely. Do you notice any cognitive distortions, like all-or-nothing thinking, disqualifying the positive, or emotional reasoning?\n\nPatient: I think there's all-or-nothing thinking, like I'm either recovered or a failure, with no in-between. And emotional reasoning, believing because I feel hopeless that I am hopeless. Also mind-reading, assuming others are judging me.\n\nTherapist: Great insights. Catching those distortions is an important step. Now let's find a thought that's more balanced and helpful. What's a different way to view this situation that doesn't involve those distortions?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be that recovery is a process with ups and downs. A setback doesn't mean I'm a failure or that I won't get better. And just because I feel hopeless doesn't mean I am hopeless or that others are judging me.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Setbacks are part of the process, not a sign of failure. And feelings aren't facts. Even when you feel hopeless, it doesn't mean you are. How can we turn this balanced thought into a coping statement you can use on difficult days?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like \"Setbacks are part of recovery, not failure. My feelings are real but not always reality. I have value no matter what.\" \n\nTherapist: I really like that coping statement. Let's write it down on a card you can keep with you. When those negative thoughts come up, you can pull out the card and remind yourself of this more balanced perspective. We can add it to your toolbox too.\n\nPatient: Having it written down will help me remember. I like the idea of a toolbox I can keep adding to.\n\nTherapist: A toolbox is a great way to organize the skills you're learning. You can keep adding tools like thought records, coping cards, and activities that boost your mood. That way, even on tough days, you have a go-to list of strategies to try.",
