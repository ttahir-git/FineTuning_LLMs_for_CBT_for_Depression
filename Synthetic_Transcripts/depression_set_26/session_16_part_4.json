  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you sometimes struggle to remember and apply coping techniques in the moment when you're feeling overwhelmed. Let's explore that a bit more. Can you give me an example of a situation where you found it challenging to use your skills?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I was at work and my boss gave me some critical feedback on a project. I immediately started feeling anxious and thinking things like \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'll never be successful.\" I knew I was falling into negative thought patterns, but I couldn't seem to stop it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. It's common to have those negative thoughts pop up in stressful situations, especially when we're receiving criticism. What do you think got in the way of using your coping techniques in that moment?\n\nPatient: I think I just got so caught up in the emotion that I couldn't think clearly. It was like my mind went blank, and I couldn't remember what I was supposed to do.\n\nTherapist: That makes a lot of sense. When we're feeling strong emotions, it can be hard to access the rational part of our brain. One strategy that can be helpful in those moments is to have a simple, go-to phrase or action that you can use to ground yourself. This could be something like taking a few deep breaths, repeating a comforting phrase to yourself, or even excusing yourself to take a short walk.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of having a go-to phrase. Maybe something like \"This feeling will pass\" or \"I'm doing the best I can.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are both great options. The key is to choose something that feels authentic and comforting to you. It can also be helpful to practice using this phrase in less stressful situations, so it becomes more automatic when you really need it.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely try that. It's good to have a plan for those moments when I feel overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And remember, even if you don't use your coping techniques perfectly in the moment, you can always go back and re-evaluate the situation later, using thought records or other skills we've practiced.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. It's not the end of the world if I don't handle something perfectly in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. The goal is progress, not perfection. Every time you practice using these skills, you're taking a step in the right direction.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder. I guess I just need to keep practicing and be patient with myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude to have. As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling. What's your overall mood and energy level right now?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better than when we started. My mood is maybe a 6 out of 10, and my energy is around a 5. Talking through these situations and making a plan helps me feel more hopeful.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that your mood and energy have improved during our session. That's a good sign that you're finding our work together helpful. Before we end, let's discuss your homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing thought records, focusing on situations where you find it challenging to use your coping techniques in the moment. You can also start using your go-to grounding phrase when you notice yourself feeling overwhelmed. Finally, I encourage you to continue attending social events or meetups, even if it feels uncomfortable at times. We can discuss your experiences at our next session.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll do my best to practice these skills and get out of my comfort zone a bit more.\n\nTherapist: Great. Remember, it's not about being perfect, but about making progress. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance and encouragement.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome. Let's plan to meet again next week at the same time. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nPatient: Sounds good. I'll see you next week.\n\nTherapist: Great. Take care of yourself, and remember to practice self-compassion. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Jamie's thought records and provided feedback and support\n  - Discussed Jamie's experience practicing self-compassion and attending a language exchange meetup\n  - Explored strategies for better remembering and applying coping techniques in challenging moments\n  - Addressed Jamie's feelings of being overwhelmed and difficulty accessing coping skills in the moment\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Continued practice identifying automatic thoughts, examining evidence for and against those thoughts, and generating alternative thoughts\n  - Self-compassion: Encouraged daily practice of self-compassionate phrases, even when not feeling particularly distressed\n  - Grounding techniques: Developed a simple, go-to phrase to use when feeling overwhelmed (e.g., \"This feeling will pass\" or \"I'm doing the best I can\")\n  - Behavioral activation: Encouraged continued attendance at social events or meetups\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Complete thought records, focusing on situations where it is challenging to use coping techniques in the moment\n  - Practice using the go-to grounding phrase when feeling overwhelmed\n  - Continue attending social events or meetups and practice self-compassion\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - Jamie is continuing to make progress with attending social events and practicing coping techniques but struggles to remember and apply skills in the moment when feeling overwhelmed\n  - Depressive symptoms continue to include sadness, anxiety, and social withdrawal, but Jamie is feeling more hopeful about making progress with the techniques discussed in therapy\n  - Jamie is interested in exploring more social events and meetups to build a support system but finds it challenging to remember and practice coping techniques regularly\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Negative core belief: \"I'm not interesting or likable enough for people to want to connect with me\"\n  - Reframed core belief: \"I have unique interests and qualities that some people find engaging, even if I don't connect with everyone\"\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue monitoring Jamie's progress with thought records and self-compassion practice\n  - Follow up on Jamie's experience attending social events and meetups\n  - Explore Jamie's experiences of feeling overwhelmed and difficulty accessing coping skills in the moment\n  - Regularly assess Jamie's depressive symptoms and adjust treatment plan as needed to ensure progress towards therapy goals\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review Jamie's thought records and provide feedback and support\n  - Discuss Jamie's experience practicing self-compassion and attending social events or meetups\n  - Explore Jamie's experiences of feeling overwhelmed and difficulty accessing coping skills in the moment\n  - Assess Jamie's depressive symptoms and progress towards therapy goals and adjust treatment plan as needed",
