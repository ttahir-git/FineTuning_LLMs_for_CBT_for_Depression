  "transcript": "Patient: That sounds like a good approach. Breaking down the thought into smaller pieces might make it easier to challenge.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. When we break down a big, overwhelming thought into smaller, more specific thoughts, it becomes easier to examine the evidence for and against each one. Let's try it together now. What's one smaller thought that contributes to the larger thought \"I'll never be able to make friends in this new city\"?\n\nPatient: One smaller thought is \"I haven't made any friends yet, even though I've been here for a while.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's look at that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you haven't made any friends yet?\n\nPatient: Well, I haven't really connected with anyone outside of work, and I spend most of my free time alone.\n\nTherapist: That's valid evidence. Now, let's look for evidence against that thought. Have there been any moments, even brief ones, where you've connected with someone in the city, even if it wasn't a deep friendship?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been a few moments. I had a nice conversation with a barista at the coffee shop near my apartment, and there's a coworker who I've chatted with a bit during breaks.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you haven't made any friends yet. Those moments of connection, even if they're brief, are still meaningful and suggest that you are capable of forming connections in this new city. Let's look at another smaller thought. What's another one that contributes to the larger thought?\n\nPatient: Another thought is \"I don't know where to meet people who share my interests.\"\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's examine that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you don't know where to meet people who share your interests?\n\nPatient: I haven't found any groups or clubs that seem like a good fit for me, and I don't know many people in the city who could introduce me to others.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. Now, let's look for evidence against that thought. Have you had any experiences that suggest there might be opportunities to meet people who share your interests, even if you haven't pursued them yet?\n\nPatient: I guess I have seen some flyers for events that seemed interesting, like a language exchange meetup and a board game night at a local cafe. And I've seen some online groups for people who are new to the city and looking to connect with others.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you don't know where to meet people who share your interests. Those events and online groups could be great opportunities to connect with others, even if you haven't taken advantage of them yet. As we've seen, when we break down a big, overwhelming thought into smaller, more specific thoughts and examine the evidence for and against each one, we often find that the big thought isn't as true as it initially seemed. How are you feeling about the thought \"I'll never be able to make friends in this new city\" now?\n\nPatient: It doesn't feel as true as it did before. I can see that there is some evidence that I have made brief connections with people, and there are potential opportunities to meet people who share my interests, even if I haven't pursued them yet.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. By examining the evidence for and against the smaller thoughts that contribute to the larger thought, we can start to shift our perspective and see things in a more balanced way. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the easier it becomes. I'd encourage you to continue practicing this skill on your own, using your thought records to break down big, overwhelming thoughts and examine the evidence for and against each smaller thought. How do you feel about that?\n\nPatient: I feel more hopeful about it now. Breaking down the thoughts and examining the evidence seems like a manageable way to challenge the negative thoughts that have been holding me back.",
