  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to start by acknowledging my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like progressive muscle relaxation and thought records. I attended a small social meetup last weekend, which was challenging but also a positive step. However, I've still been struggling with self-doubt and negative self-talk, especially in social situations.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and attended a social meetup. Those are significant steps forward. It's also important that we discuss the challenges you're facing with self-doubt and negative self-talk. Let's prioritize that for today's session. What else would you like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I'd like to explore more strategies for managing my negative thoughts and building my confidence in social situations. I also want to discuss how I can be more consistent with my coping techniques and homework.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. We can definitely work on strategies for managing negative thoughts and building confidence in social situations. We can also discuss ways to make your coping techniques and homework more manageable and consistent. Here's a proposed agenda for today's session:\n\n1. Check-in on your experience with the loving-kindness meditation and progressive muscle relaxation\n2. Review your thought records and discuss any challenges or insights\n3. Explore strategies for managing negative thoughts and building confidence in social situations\n4. Discuss ways to make your coping techniques and homework more manageable and consistent\n5. Assign homework for the next session\n\nHow does that sound? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?",
