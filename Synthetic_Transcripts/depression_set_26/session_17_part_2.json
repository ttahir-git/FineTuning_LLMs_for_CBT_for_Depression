  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me, Nova. I don't have anything else to add at the moment.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your experience with thought records and self-compassion practice since our last session. How has it been going for you?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to complete the thought records, but I find it challenging to do them consistently. I often forget to fill them out when I'm feeling overwhelmed, and when I do remember, it's hard to identify my thoughts and emotions in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Jamie. It takes practice to build the habit of completing thought records regularly. Remember, it's okay if you can't fill them out every time you're feeling overwhelmed. The goal is to do it as often as you can, and it will become easier over time. Let's look at one of the thought records you managed to complete. Can you share an example with me?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I was at work, and my supervisor asked me to stay late to finish a project. I immediately felt anxious and frustrated. My automatic thought was, \"I'm always the one who has to stay late and do extra work.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, so in that situation, your emotions were anxiety and frustration, and your automatic thought was that you're always the one who has to stay late and do extra work. What evidence did you find for and against this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, the evidence for the thought is that I have had to stay late a few times in the past month. However, the evidence against the thought is that my coworkers have also had to stay late at times. It's not just me.\n\nTherapist: Good job identifying evidence for and against the thought, Jamie. What was the alternative thought you came up with?\n\nPatient: My alternative thought was, \"Everyone has to stay late sometimes, and it's not always me. My supervisor trusts me to get the work done.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Jamie. It's more balanced and takes into account the evidence you identified. How did your emotions change after coming up with this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I felt a bit less anxious and frustrated. I guess I realized that it's not personal, and it's just part of the job sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. This is a good example of how thought records can help you challenge negative automatic thoughts and reduce the intensity of your emotions. Remember, the more you practice, the easier it will become. Now, let's talk about your experience with self-compassion practice. How has that been going?",
