  "transcript": "Patient: Since our last session, my mood has been relatively stable. I've had some moments of sadness and loneliness, but I've been trying to use the techniques we've discussed to manage those feelings. I've also noticed that I'm a bit more motivated to engage in activities, like going to the board game meetup.\n\nTherapist: It's good to hear that your mood has been relatively stable and that you're feeling more motivated to engage in activities. The fact that you're using the techniques we've discussed to manage your feelings of sadness and loneliness is a significant step forward. I'm curious about your experience with the thought records. How have you found that process?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to fill out the thought records when I notice myself feeling down or anxious. It's been helpful to identify the automatic thoughts and look at the evidence for and against them. Sometimes it's challenging to come up with alternative thoughts, but I'm getting better at it with practice.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Jamie. Identifying automatic thoughts and examining the evidence for and against them is a crucial skill in CBT. It's normal to find it challenging to come up with alternative thoughts at first, but as you said, it gets easier with practice. Do you have any specific examples of automatic thoughts you've challenged recently?\n\nPatient: Yeah, when I was getting ready to go to the board game meetup, I had the thought, \"I won't fit in with anyone there, and I'll end up feeling awkward and alone.\" I looked at the evidence for and against that thought and realized that I've connected with people at meetups before, and even if I don't make a strong connection, I can still enjoy playing the games.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent example of challenging an automatic thought. By examining the evidence, you were able to come up with a more balanced perspective. This is a great skill to have when facing situations that trigger anxiety or self-doubt. Let's continue to practice this skill in our sessions and in your daily life.\n\nNow, I'd like to introduce a new distress tolerance technique called progressive muscle relaxation. This technique involves systematically tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body, which can help reduce physical tension and promote a sense of calm. We'll start by focusing on a few muscle groups, and I'll guide you through the process. Does that sound okay?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds interesting. I'm willing to give it a try.",
