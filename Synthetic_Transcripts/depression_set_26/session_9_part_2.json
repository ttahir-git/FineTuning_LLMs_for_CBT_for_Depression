  "transcript": "Patient: It's been a bit of a mixed bag. I did reach out to the organizer of a language exchange group, which was a big step for me. But I haven't heard back yet, and I'm starting to feel discouraged.\n\nTherapist: Reaching out to the group organizer is a significant step forward, Jamie. It takes courage to put yourself out there, especially when it feels uncomfortable. Let's explore your feelings of discouragement a bit more. What thoughts are going through your mind as you wait for a response?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm thinking that they're not going to get back to me, or that they don't want me in their group. I'm also worried that even if they do respond, I won't fit in or I'll feel awkward around new people.\n\nTherapist: Those are understandable concerns, Jamie. Let's look at them more closely. Do you have any evidence that the group organizer doesn't want you in their group?\n\nPatient: Well, no, I don't have any concrete evidence. It's just a feeling I have.\n\nTherapist: That's an important distinction \u2013 the difference between a feeling and a fact. Sometimes our feelings can be so strong that they feel like facts, but they're not always accurate. Is it possible that there could be other reasons for the delay in response, aside from the organizer not wanting you in the group?\n\nPatient: I suppose there could be other reasons. They might be busy, or maybe they didn't see my message yet.\n\nTherapist: Those are both plausible explanations. Now, let's consider your worry about not fitting in or feeling awkward. Have you ever been in a new social situation before where you initially felt awkward but eventually felt more comfortable?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I have. When I first started my job, I felt really out of place and unsure of myself. But over time, I got to know my coworkers and started to feel more at ease.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how initial discomfort doesn't necessarily mean that a situation won't work out. It's normal to feel awkward in new social situations, but that doesn't mean you won't eventually feel more comfortable. Let's try to reframe your thoughts about the language exchange group. Instead of assuming the worst, could you consider the possibility that it might just take some time to hear back and to feel comfortable with the group?\n\nPatient: I can try to keep that in mind. It's just hard not to get caught up in the negative thoughts sometimes.\n\nTherapist: It is hard, Jamie, and that's why we're practicing these skills \u2013 to help you catch those negative thoughts and challenge them. Remember, just because a thought feels true doesn't mean it is true. We have to examine the evidence and consider alternative perspectives.\n\nNow, let's talk about your goal of joining the language exchange group. Breaking this goal down into smaller steps can make it feel more manageable. What would be the next small step you could take towards this goal, regardless of whether or not you hear back from this particular group?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could look for other language exchange groups in the area, or even online groups. That way, I'm not putting all my eggs in one basket.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Jamie! Expanding your options can help you feel more empowered and less dependent on the response of one group. It also increases your chances of finding a group that's a good fit for you. What might be some indicators that a group could be a good fit?\n\nPatient: I think a group that meets regularly but not too frequently, so I don't feel overwhelmed. And maybe a group that has a mix of language levels, so I don't feel like I'm the only beginner.\n\nTherapist: Those are great factors to consider, Jamie. Having a clear idea of what you're looking for can help you evaluate your options and make a decision that feels right for you. As you explore other groups, remember to keep an open mind and be patient with yourself. It's okay if it takes some time to find the right fit.\n\nPatient: Thanks, I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just hard not to get discouraged sometimes.\n\nTherapist: It is hard, Jamie, and that's why we're working on building your resilience and self-compassion. Remember, setbacks and challenges are a normal part of the process. They don't mean you're failing or that you can't reach your goals. What matters is how you respond to those challenges \u2013 and you're doing a great job of continuing to take steps forward, even when it's difficult.",
