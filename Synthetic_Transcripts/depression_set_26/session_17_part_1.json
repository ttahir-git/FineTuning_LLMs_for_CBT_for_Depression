  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for our 17th session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've been providing me. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the coping techniques we discussed, but it's still a challenge for me to remember and apply them in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I attended another language exchange meetup, which was nice, but I still find it hard to connect with people on a deeper level.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been making an effort to practice the coping techniques and attend social events. It's understandable that it's still challenging to apply these skills consistently, especially when feeling overwhelmed. Building meaningful connections with others can also take time and practice. Let's explore this further today. Before we do, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on strategies for remembering and applying coping techniques when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I also want to discuss how I can work on building deeper connections with people, as I often feel like I'm not interesting or likable enough for people to want to connect with me.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today, Jamie. We can definitely explore strategies to help you better remember and apply coping techniques in challenging moments. We can also work on reframing that negative core belief about not being interesting or likable enough. Here's a proposed agenda for our session:\n\n1. Review your experience with thought records and self-compassion practice since our last session\n2. Explore strategies for remembering and applying coping techniques when feeling overwhelmed\n3. Discuss ways to build deeper connections with others and reframe negative core beliefs\n4. Assign homework for the next session\n\nHow does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?",
