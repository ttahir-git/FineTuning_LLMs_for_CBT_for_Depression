  "transcript": "Patient: You know, I've always been a pretty independent person, but lately, I feel like I'm just going through the motions. I don't enjoy the things I used to, and I find myself avoiding social situations more and more.\n\nTherapist: It's common for people experiencing depression to lose interest in activities they once enjoyed and to withdraw from social interactions. Can you tell me more about how this has been affecting your daily life and relationships?\n\nPatient: Well, I used to love singing and learning new languages in my free time, but now, I can't seem to muster the energy or motivation to do those things. I've also noticed that I'm not as productive at work, and I'm calling out sick more often because I just can't bring myself to get out of bed some days.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like your depressive symptoms are really taking a toll on multiple aspects of your life, from your hobbies and passions to your work performance. I want to explore a bit more about your personal history and background. You mentioned that you moved to this new city a couple of years ago. How has that transition been for you, and do you think it has contributed to your current emotional state?\n\nPatient: The move was definitely a big change for me. I grew up in a close-knit community, and I had a strong support system back home. Moving here, I felt like I had to start all over again, and it's been harder than I thought it would be to build new friendships and connections. I think the isolation and loneliness have definitely played a role in my depression.\n\nTherapist: It makes sense that such a significant life change could contribute to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can be risk factors for depression. I'm curious about your family dynamics and how they may have influenced your decision to move and your current emotional state. Can you tell me a bit more about your family and your relationship with them?\n\nPatient: Well, I come from a big family, and we've always been really close. My parents and siblings were initially supportive of my decision to move, but I think they're starting to worry about me. I don't talk to them as much as I used to, and when we do talk, I try to put on a brave face and not let them know how much I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that you want to appear strong for your family, but it's also important to acknowledge your own emotional needs. It seems like there might be a pattern of you putting others' needs before your own, which could be contributing to your current challenges. As we continue to work together, we'll explore these patterns and find ways to prioritize your own well-being while still maintaining your valued relationships.",
