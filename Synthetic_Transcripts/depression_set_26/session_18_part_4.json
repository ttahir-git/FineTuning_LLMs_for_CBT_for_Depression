As we start to wrap up our session today, I want to make sure we've covered everything you wanted to discuss. How are you feeling about what we've talked about so far?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling good about our session today, Nova. It's been helpful to review my thought records and talk more about vulnerability and building connections. I feel like I have a clearer sense of what I need to keep working on.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Jamie. It's wonderful that you're feeling clearer about your goals and the skills you want to keep practicing. Before we end today, let's talk about some homework for the next week.\n\nI'd like you to continue practicing the thought records, focusing on situations where you find it challenging to use coping techniques in the moment. It's okay if you don't always remember to do it right away - the important thing is to keep practicing and building that habit.\n\nI also encourage you to keep using your coping card when you feel overwhelmed, and to practice vulnerability by sharing something a little more personal with someone at a social event or meetup. Remember, it's not about doing it perfectly, it's about taking small risks and building up those experiences over time.\n\nFinally, I'd like you to think about what you'd like to include in your personalized \"toolbox\" of CBT skills. We can start putting that together in our next session.\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I like having specific things to work on between sessions. And I'm excited to start creating my toolbox.\n\nTherapist: I'm excited about that too, Jamie. It's going to be a really valuable resource for you going forward. And remember, if you have any questions or challenges come up during the week, don't hesitate to bring them to our next session. That's what I'm here for.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your support. I'm looking forward to our next session.\n\nTherapist: I'm looking forward to it too, Jamie. You're doing an amazing job, and I'm excited to continue our work together. Until next time, take care of yourself, and remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself in the process.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Jamie's thought records and provided feedback and support\n  - Discussed Jamie's experience practicing self-compassion, using the coping card, and practicing vulnerability at a social event\n  - Explored Jamie's experiences of feeling overwhelmed and difficulty accessing coping skills in the moment\n  - Assessed Jamie's depressive symptoms and progress towards therapy goals and made a plan for the next session\n  - Introduced the idea of creating a personalized \"toolbox\" of CBT skills to support Jamie after therapy ends\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Continued practice identifying automatic thoughts, examining evidence for and against those thoughts, and generating alternative thoughts\n  - Coping card: Reviewed Jamie's experience using the coping card when feeling overwhelmed at a social event\n  - Vulnerability: Discussed Jamie's experience practicing vulnerability by sharing more about their background and interests at a meetup\n  - Self-compassion: Encouraged Jamie to continue practicing self-compassionate phrases, even when not feeling particularly distressed\n  - Toolbox: Introduced the idea of creating a personalized \"toolbox\" of CBT skills and strategies to support Jamie after therapy ends\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Complete thought records, focusing on situations where it is challenging to use coping techniques in the moment\n  - Practice using the coping card when feeling overwhelmed\n  - Practice vulnerability by sharing something a little more personal with someone at a social event or meetup\n  - Continue attending social events or meetups and practice self-compassion\n  - Think about what to include in personalized \"toolbox\" of CBT skills\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - Jamie is continuing to make progress with attending social events and practicing coping techniques but struggles to remember and apply skills in the moment when feeling overwhelmed\n  - Depressive symptoms continue to include sadness, anxiety, and social withdrawal, but Jamie is feeling more hopeful about making progress with the techniques discussed in therapy\n  - Jamie is interested in exploring more social events and meetups to build a support system but finds it challenging to remember and practice coping techniques regularly\n  - Jamie is starting to see how the different CBT techniques fit together and is feeling more hopeful about their progress in therapy\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Negative core belief: \"I'm not interesting or likable enough for people to want to connect with me\"\n  - Reframed core belief: \"I have unique interests and qualities that some people find engaging, even if I don't connect with everyone\"\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue monitoring Jamie's progress with thought records and self-compassion practice\n  - Follow up on Jamie's experience attending social events and meetups and practicing vulnerability\n  - Explore Jamie's experiences of feeling overwhelmed and difficulty accessing coping skills in the moment\n  - Regularly assess Jamie's depressive symptoms and adjust treatment plan as needed to ensure progress towards therapy goals\n  - Start creating Jamie's personalized \"toolbox\" of CBT skills and strategies\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review Jamie's thought records and provide feedback and support\n  - Discuss Jamie's experience practicing self-compassion, using the coping card, and practicing vulnerability\n  - Explore Jamie's experiences of feeling overwhelmed and difficulty accessing coping skills in the moment\n  - Assess Jamie's depressive symptoms and progress towards therapy goals and adjust treatment plan as needed\n  - Start creating Jamie's personalized \"toolbox\" of CBT skills and strategies",
