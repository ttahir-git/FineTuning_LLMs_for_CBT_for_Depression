  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 10. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been practicing the distress tolerance techniques we discussed, and they've been helpful in managing my emotions. I also reached out to my language buddy, and we've set up a time to practice Spanish together. However, I've still been struggling with negative thoughts and feelings of sadness and guilt.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the distress tolerance techniques have been helpful for you, and that you've taken the step to connect with your language buddy. It's also important that you're recognizing and acknowledging the ongoing struggles with negative thoughts and emotions. Let's make sure to address those in today's session. Before we set our agenda, can you share a bit more about the negative thoughts and feelings you've been experiencing?\n\nPatient: Sure. I've been having thoughts like \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'll never be able to make meaningful connections here.\" These thoughts have been bringing down my mood and making it harder to motivate myself to engage in activities or reach out to others.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. Those negative thoughts can be really challenging to deal with, and it's understandable that they're impacting your mood and motivation. Let's definitely prioritize working on challenging those thoughts today. What else would you like to focus on in our session?\n\nPatient: I'd also like to discuss some strategies for managing the feelings of sadness and guilt that have been coming up. And maybe we could touch on how I can continue building my support system here, as that's still a challenge for me.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, those are great topics to include in our agenda. So, it looks like we'll be focusing on:\n1. Challenging negative thoughts, particularly \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'll never be able to make meaningful connections here.\"\n2. Strategies for managing feelings of sadness and guilt.\n3. Discussing ways to continue building your support system.\n\nDoes this agenda feel right to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or adjust?",
