  "transcript": "Patient: I don't think there's anything else I want to work on right now. I think the goals we've set are good for me.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Jamie. I think we've set some really meaningful and achievable goals for your therapy. To recap, our primary goal is to reduce your depressive symptoms by 50% over the next 8 weeks. We'll work towards this by continuing to practice thought records and Socratic questioning, and by introducing behavioral activation with a focus on enjoyable, meaningful, and social activities.\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me.\n\nTherapist: Before we wrap up, let's talk about your homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing thought records, just like we did today. Try to do at least one per day, and bring them with you to our next session so we can review them together. I'd also like you to start brainstorming ideas for behavioral activation activities. Think about things you enjoy, things that give you a sense of accomplishment, and ways to build more social connection into your life. We'll start incorporating those activities into a schedule next week.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can do that. I'll try to come up with some good ideas.\n\nTherapist: I'm sure you will, Jamie. And remember, the homework is meant to be helpful, not stressful. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, just do what you can. Every little bit of practice helps.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova.
