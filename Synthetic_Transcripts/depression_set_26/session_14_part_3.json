  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's continue our discussion about building confidence in social situations. One strategy we can use is to identify and challenge the negative core beliefs that may be contributing to your self-doubt and anxiety. Core beliefs are deeply held beliefs about ourselves, others, and the world that often develop early in life and can influence how we interpret situations. Can you think of any core beliefs that might be impacting your confidence in social situations?\n\nPatient: I think one core belief that affects me is the idea that I'm not interesting or likable enough for people to want to connect with me. I often feel like I don't have much to offer in social interactions.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that. This belief that you're not interesting or likable enough is a great example of a negative core belief. These beliefs can be challenging to change because they're so deeply ingrained, but we can work on reframing them by gathering evidence that contradicts them. Let's start by looking for evidence against the belief that you're not interesting or likable. What are some experiences you've had that suggest otherwise?\n\nPatient: Well, I have made some connections at meetups before, and people seemed to enjoy talking to me. I also have a few close friends who have stuck by me for years, so that must mean I have some likable qualities.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of evidence against your negative core belief. Your experiences at meetups and your long-lasting friendships suggest that you do have interesting and likable qualities. Another way to reframe this core belief is to develop a more balanced and realistic belief, such as \"I have unique interests and qualities that some people find engaging, even if I don't connect with everyone.\" How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds more balanced and realistic. I like the idea of focusing on the fact that I have unique interests and qualities that some people find engaging, rather than trying to please everyone.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By focusing on your unique interests and qualities, you can build confidence in what you have to offer in social situations. Another strategy for building confidence is to practice self-compassion. When you notice yourself having negative thoughts about your social skills or likability, try to respond with kindness and understanding, just as you would to a good friend who was struggling with similar thoughts.\n\nPatient: I can see how practicing self-compassion could help me feel more confident and less critical of myself in social situations. It's just hard to break the habit of negative self-talk.\n\nTherapist: It's true that changing the habit of negative self-talk takes practice, but with time and persistence, it can become more natural. One way to practice self-compassion is to write down some compassionate responses to your negative thoughts and review them regularly. For example, if you notice yourself thinking, \"I'm not interesting enough for people to want to connect with me,\" you could respond with something like, \"Everyone has unique experiences and perspectives to offer, including me. I don't need to be perfect to be worthy of connection.\"\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I can try writing down some compassionate responses and reviewing them before social events to help shift my mindset.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. Practicing self-compassion, along with challenging negative core beliefs and focusing on your unique qualities, can help you build confidence in social situations over time. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and there may be setbacks along the way, but with continued practice, you can develop a more balanced and resilient sense of self.",
