  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up today's session, I want to review the key concepts we've discussed. We explored the cognitive distortions of all-or-nothing thinking, disqualifying the positive, and mental filter, and how these distortions contribute to your negative thoughts and depressive symptoms. We also introduced the technique of Socratic questioning to challenge and reframe these negative thoughts. How do you feel about what we've covered today?\n\nPatient: It's been a lot to take in, but I feel like I'm starting to understand how my thought patterns are affecting my mood. The Socratic questioning technique seems like it could be helpful.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Jamie. As we discussed earlier, homework assignments are an important part of CBT. For this week, I'd like to assign a small, achievable task related to thought monitoring. I'd like you to continue using the thought record to track your negative thoughts and the emotions they trigger. In addition, I'd like you to choose one negative thought each day and apply the Socratic questioning technique to it. Write down the evidence for and against the thought, and try to come up with a more balanced perspective. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: It sounds manageable. I'll give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, the goal is not to completely eliminate negative thoughts, but rather to start recognizing them and challenging them when they arise. If you have any questions or concerns while doing the homework, feel free to bring them up in our next session.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: Before we end today's session, I want to provide a detailed summary of what we've covered.
