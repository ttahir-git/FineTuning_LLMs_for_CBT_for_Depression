  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been practicing the distress tolerance techniques we discussed, like deep breathing and mindfulness, and I've found them helpful in managing my emotions. I also attended a board game meetup, which was a bit nerve-wracking, but I'm glad I went.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the distress tolerance techniques and finding them helpful. Attending the board game meetup is a significant step forward in building connections and engaging in activities you enjoy. How did it feel to be in that social setting?\n\nPatient: It was definitely uncomfortable at first. I felt anxious and a bit self-conscious, but as the night went on, I started to relax and enjoy myself. I even connected with a couple of people who seemed really friendly and welcoming.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful insight, Jamie. It's common to feel anxious and self-conscious in new social situations, but I'm glad you stuck with it and found some friendly faces. This experience shows that even though social situations can be challenging, there's often a reward in pushing through the initial discomfort. Let's keep this in mind as we work on building your support system.\n\nFor today's session, I'd like to suggest a few agenda items. First, let's review your thought records and discuss any challenges or successes you've had with them. Second, I'd like to explore your experience with the board game meetup in more detail and discuss how we can continue to challenge negative thoughts related to social situations. Finally, I'd like to introduce a new distress tolerance technique called progressive muscle relaxation. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I'm particularly interested in discussing the board game meetup and how to challenge negative thoughts in social situations. I think that's an area where I could really use some help.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jamie. We can definitely focus on that. Before we dive in, let's take a moment to check in on your overall mood and any changes in your depressive symptoms since our last session. Can you tell me how you've been feeling in general?",
