  "transcript": "Patient: I like that reframe. It reminds me that not everyone has to like me, and that's okay. I guess I just get caught up in wanting to be liked by everyone.\n\nTherapist: That's a common desire, Jamie, but as you said, it's not realistic or necessary for everyone to like us. In fact, trying to please everyone can be exhausting and lead to feelings of inauthenticity. It's more important to focus on being true to yourself and connecting with people who appreciate you for who you are. Another strategy for building deeper connections is to practice vulnerability. This means sharing more about yourself, your thoughts, and your feelings with others, even if it feels scary or uncomfortable at first. When we're vulnerable with others, it creates opportunities for deeper connection and understanding. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: Vulnerability is definitely scary for me. I worry about being judged or rejected if I share too much about myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, Jamie, and it's normal to feel that way. However, I want to remind you that vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness. It takes courage to share your authentic self with others. And while there is always a risk of judgment or rejection, there is also the potential for deeper connection and acceptance. One way to practice vulnerability is to start small. You don't have to share your deepest, darkest secrets right away. Instead, try sharing something a little bit more personal than you usually would, and see how it feels. For example, you could share a story about a challenge you've faced or a goal you're working towards. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: Starting small seems more manageable. I can try sharing something a little more personal next time I'm at a meetup or social event.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Jamie. Remember, vulnerability is a practice, and it gets easier over time. I'm proud of you for being willing to try. As we wrap up our session today, I want to check in with you about your current mood and any final thoughts you have.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a little bit more hopeful after our conversation today. I know it will take time and practice to build deeper connections with others, but I feel like I have some strategies to try now.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Jamie. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. The important thing is that you keep practicing and being kind to yourself in the process. For homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing your grounding phrase and self-compassionate phrases, using your coping card as needed. I also encourage you to practice vulnerability by sharing something a little more personal with someone at a social event or meetup. Finally, continue completing thought records, focusing on situations where it's challenging to use coping techniques in the moment. How does that sound for homework?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll do my best to practice vulnerability and keep using my coping techniques.\n\nTherapist: Great, I look forward to hearing about your experiences next session.
