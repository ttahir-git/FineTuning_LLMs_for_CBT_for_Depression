  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for our second session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge that as an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm committed to doing my best to help you through this CBT process. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations before we continue?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being upfront about your limitations. I'm ready to get started with today's session.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's begin by setting an agenda for today. First, I'd like to review the homework I assigned last time - the thought record. We'll discuss any insights you gained from that exercise. Then, I'll introduce some new coping strategies and techniques to help manage your depressive symptoms. We'll also continue exploring the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and work on developing more balanced and helpful thought patterns. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm particularly interested in learning new coping strategies.\n\nTherapist: We'll definitely focus on that. But first, let's review your thought record. Were you able to complete it over the past week? Can you share some of the negative thoughts you noticed and the evidence you found supporting or contradicting those thoughts?",
