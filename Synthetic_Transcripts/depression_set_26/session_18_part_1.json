  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for our 18th session together. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say, as I can't directly observe non-verbal cues. I also want to remind you that if you ever experience a mental health crisis or need emergency services, I'm not equipped to provide that level of support, and it's crucial to reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services in your area.\n\nWith that said, I'm excited to continue our work together today. How have you been since our last session? Can you share a bit about your mood, experiences, and any changes you've noticed?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about that. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the coping techniques we've discussed, like using the coping card when I feel overwhelmed. It's still a challenge to remember to use them in the moment, but I'm making progress. I attended a meetup last weekend for language learners, and I pushed myself to share a bit more about my background and interests. It felt vulnerable, but also good to connect with people on a deeper level. My mood has been fairly stable, with some ups and downs, but overall, I'm feeling a bit more hopeful.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the coping techniques and attending social events, Jamie. Pushing yourself to be vulnerable and share more about yourself is a big step forward. I'm glad to hear that it felt good to connect with people on a deeper level. It's also understandable that remembering to use the coping techniques in the moment is still a challenge. That's something we can continue to work on together.\n\nFor today's session, I thought we could start by reviewing your thought records and discussing your experience with practicing self-compassion and using the coping card. We can also explore your experiences of feeling overwhelmed and any difficulties accessing coping skills in those moments. Additionally, we can assess your depressive symptoms and progress towards your therapy goals, and make any necessary adjustments to our treatment plan. Does that sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me, Nova. I'm happy to review my thought records and discuss my experiences with the coping techniques. I'd also like to talk more about building deeper connections with others and how I can continue to work on that. It's something I struggle with, but I know it's important for my overall well-being.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jamie. Building deeper connections with others is a great topic to focus on today. It ties in nicely with the work we've been doing on vulnerability and challenging negative core beliefs. We can explore some strategies for continuing to build those connections and how to navigate any challenges that come up.\n\nLet's start by reviewing your thought records. Can you share some examples of situations where you found it challenging to use coping techniques in the moment?",
