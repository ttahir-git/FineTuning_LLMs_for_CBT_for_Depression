  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's practice a meta-thought record together now. Can you think of a recent experience where you had thoughts or feelings about the therapy process that we could explore?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. Earlier this week, I was feeling really overwhelmed with work and I started to doubt whether the CBT skills we've been working on were really making a difference. I had the thought, \"I'm never going to get better, no matter how hard I try.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to work with. Let's start by identifying the situation, emotion, and automatic thought. The situation was feeling overwhelmed at work, the emotion was probably something like hopelessness or despair, and the automatic thought was, \"I'm never going to get better, no matter how hard I try.\" Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yes, that captures it well.\n\nTherapist: Okay, now let's look at the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're never going to get better?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been struggling with these depressive symptoms for a long time, and even though I've made some progress, I still have bad days where I feel really low.\n\nTherapist: That's valid evidence. Now, what about evidence against the thought? What progress have you made that suggests you are getting better, even if it's not always consistent?\n\nPatient: I guess I have been able to use the CBT skills to manage my symptoms better than before. I've had moments where I've been able to set boundaries at work and practice self-compassion. And overall, my mood has improved somewhat since starting therapy.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Those are all really important pieces of evidence that you are making progress, even if it doesn't always feel that way. Now, let's look at the impact of this thought. How does thinking \"I'm never going to get better\" make you feel and behave?\n\nPatient: When I think that way, I feel really hopeless and defeated. It makes me want to give up on trying to use the CBT skills because I feel like it's pointless.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense. That thought is really discouraging and demotivating. Now, let's try to come up with an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence for and against the original thought, as well as the impact it has on you.\n\nPatient: How about something like, \"I may not be where I want to be yet, but I am making progress and the CBT skills are helping, even if it's not always consistent.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought! It acknowledges the progress you've made while also recognizing that it's an ongoing process. How does thinking that thought make you feel, compared to the original thought?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel more hopeful and motivated to keep trying. It reminds me that progress isn't always linear, and that's okay.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And that's something you can remind yourself of in moments when you're feeling discouraged. You can use this meta-thought record process to challenge those discouraging thoughts and reframe them in a more balanced and helpful way.\n\nPatient: That's really helpful. I can see how doing this kind of thought record on my own could help me maintain my progress after therapy ends.\n\nTherapist: Definitely. It's a powerful tool for becoming your own therapist and continuing to apply the CBT principles independently. And remember, you can always refer back to the coping cards and other resources we've created together for additional support.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel more equipped to handle the challenges that come my way, knowing that I have these skills and tools to fall back on.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Amira. Remember, the goal of therapy is not to eliminate all difficulties, but to equip you with the skills to navigate them in a healthier and more adaptive way. And you've made tremendous progress in building those skills over the course of our work together.",
