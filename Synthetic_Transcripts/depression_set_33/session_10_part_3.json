  "transcript": "Patient: Having a mantra like that could be helpful. I'll try to come up with one that resonates with me and write it down somewhere I can easily access it when I need it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Amira. Having your mantra written down and easily accessible can make it more tangible and serve as a helpful reminder when you're feeling overwhelmed or doubting yourself.\n\nAs we continue to work on reframing your core beliefs and challenging negative thoughts, it's also important to address some of the specific depressive symptoms you've been experiencing, such as low energy and motivation. These symptoms can make it challenging to engage in activities that promote well-being and reinforce positive beliefs.\n\nOne technique that can be helpful in addressing low motivation is behavioral activation. This involves identifying activities that bring you a sense of accomplishment, pleasure, or mastery and gradually increasing your engagement in these activities, even when you don't feel motivated.\n\nCan you think of some activities that typically bring you a sense of accomplishment or enjoyment, even if you haven't felt motivated to do them lately?\n\nPatient: I used to enjoy cooking and trying new recipes, but I haven't had the energy or motivation to do that recently. I also used to find pleasure in tending to my garden, but I've been neglecting it lately.\n\nTherapist: Those are both great examples of activities that can bring a sense of accomplishment and pleasure. When we're experiencing depressive symptoms, it's common to lose interest in activities we once enjoyed. However, engaging in these activities, even when we don't feel motivated, can help improve our mood and energy levels over time.\n\nLet's start by setting a small, achievable goal related to one of these activities. For example, you could choose one new recipe to try this week or set aside 15 minutes to tend to your garden. The key is to start small and gradually build up as you begin to experience the benefits of engaging in these activities.\n\nPatient: I think I could start by setting aside some time to water my garden and do some light pruning. It's a small task, but it might help me feel more connected to an activity I used to enjoy.\n\nTherapist: That's a great start, Amira. Remember, the goal is not to pressure yourself to accomplish a lot but to engage in an activity that brings you a sense of mastery or pleasure. As you begin to experience the benefits of behavioral activation, you can gradually increase the frequency or duration of these activities.\n\nAnother technique that can be helpful in addressing depressive symptoms is challenging perfectionistic thoughts. Perfectionism can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and low self-worth, making it difficult to engage in activities or take on new challenges.\n\nCan you think of any perfectionistic thoughts that have been holding you back or contributing to your depressive symptoms?",
