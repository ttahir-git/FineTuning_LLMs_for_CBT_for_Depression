  "transcript": "Patient: I'm glad we have a plan for today's session. I feel like I need some guidance on how to handle these negative thoughts when they come up, especially in situations like the one at work.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Amira. Let's start by exploring the situation at work in more detail. Can you walk me through what happened and the thoughts and emotions that came up for you?\n\nPatient: Well, I was in a meeting with my supervisor, and she gave me some feedback on a project I had been working on. She pointed out a few areas where I could have done better, and even though she also mentioned some positive things, I couldn't help but focus on the criticism. I started thinking that I'm not good enough at my job and that everyone must think I'm incompetent.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Amira. It's common to have those kinds of negative thoughts in response to criticism, especially when it taps into core beliefs about ourselves. Let's take a closer look at the thoughts you had in that moment. Can you identify any cognitive distortions that might have been at play?\n\nPatient: I think I was definitely filtering out the positive and focusing only on the negative. I also jumped to conclusions by assuming that everyone must think I'm incompetent, even though my supervisor didn't say that.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Amira. Filtering and jumping to conclusions are common cognitive distortions that can contribute to negative thoughts and feelings. Another distortion that might be relevant here is all-or-nothing thinking, where we see things in black-and-white terms rather than shades of gray. It's possible that you were seeing yourself as either completely competent or completely incompetent, without considering the middle ground.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I do tend to think in those extremes sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Many people do, and it's something we can work on together. One way to challenge these distortions is to examine the evidence for and against the negative thoughts. Let's look at the thought that you're not good enough at your job. What evidence do you have that supports that thought?\n\nPatient: Well, my supervisor did point out some areas where I could have done better on the project.\n\nTherapist: Okay, that's one piece of evidence. What about evidence against the thought that you're not good enough at your job?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could look at my overall performance and the positive feedback I've received in the past. I've been in this role for a long time and have generally done well.\n\nTherapist: That's an important piece of evidence to consider. It's also worth noting that everyone has room for improvement, and receiving constructive feedback is a normal part of professional growth. It doesn't necessarily mean that you're not good enough overall.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I guess I tend to blow things out of proportion sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's another cognitive distortion we call magnification. It's when we exaggerate the importance or significance of something, often to the point where it feels overwhelming or catastrophic. Recognizing these distortions is an important step in challenging negative thoughts.\n\nPatient: It's helpful to have a name for these patterns. I feel like I can recognize them more easily now.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Amira. As we continue to practice identifying and challenging these distortions, it will become easier to catch them in the moment and reframe your thoughts in a more balanced way. Speaking of practice, let's take a look at the thought records you've been working on since our last session. Can you share some examples of thoughts you've challenged and how you've reframed them?",
