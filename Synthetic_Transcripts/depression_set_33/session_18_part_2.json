  "transcript": "Patient: Yes, that sounds good. I'm eager to keep practicing these skills and hopefully feel less overwhelmed at work.\n\nTherapist: Great! Before we dive into that, let's take a moment to review your homework from our last session. You were going to complete at least one thought record per day, focusing on work-related situations, schedule at least one self-care activity, and adjust deadlines for two projects, giving yourself an extra day for each. How did that go?\n\nPatient: Well, as I mentioned earlier, I struggled with the thought records, especially when I was feeling overwhelmed at work. I did manage to complete a few, but not as many as I would have liked. The self-care activity was easier for me. I scheduled a yoga class on Saturday morning, which felt really good. And I did adjust the deadlines for two projects, but I found myself working late to make up for the extra time, so I'm not sure if that really helped.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Amira. It's okay if you didn't complete as many thought records as you would have liked. The important thing is that you tried, and we can continue to practice that skill together. I'm glad to hear that you scheduled a self-care activity and that the yoga class felt good. That's a great step towards prioritizing your well-being. Regarding the adjusted deadlines, it's interesting that you found yourself working late to make up for the extra time. Let's explore that a bit more. What thoughts or beliefs do you think might have contributed to that behavior?\n\nPatient: I think part of it is that I'm so used to working under tight deadlines that giving myself extra time felt like slacking off. I had this nagging feeling that I should be using that time to get ahead on other projects or be even more thorough in my work.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. It sounds like there might be some beliefs around productivity and self-worth tied up in your work habits. We've talked before about your core belief that you're only worthy of love and respect if you're perfect, and I wonder if that belief might be influencing your behavior around deadlines. What do you think?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think you're right. It's like I feel guilty if I'm not constantly working and being productive, even if it's at the expense of my well-being.\n\nTherapist: That's a common struggle for many people, especially those with perfectionistic tendencies. Let's take a moment to challenge that belief. What would you say to a friend or colleague who expressed feeling guilty for taking a break or adjusting a deadline?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that breaks are important for avoiding burnout and that adjusting deadlines is sometimes necessary to ensure the quality of their work. I'd remind them that their well-being is just as important as their work performance.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Amira. And what would it be like to apply that same compassion and understanding to yourself?\n\nPatient: It would be difficult, but I think it would help me feel less overwhelmed and guilty about taking breaks or adjusting deadlines.\n\nTherapist: I agree. Self-compassion is a key component of managing perfectionism and prioritizing self-care. Let's practice applying that same understanding and kindness to yourself, just as you would to a friend or colleague. One way to do that is through a technique called \"self-compassionate reframing.\" When you notice yourself feeling guilty or overwhelmed about taking a break or adjusting a deadline, try to reframe that thought in a more self-compassionate way. For example, instead of thinking, \"I should be using this time to get ahead on other projects,\" you could try thinking, \"Taking a break is important for my well-being and will actually help me be more productive in the long run.\" How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of reframing my thoughts in a more self-compassionate way. It's just hard to remember to do that in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. Like any new skill, self-compassionate reframing takes practice. One way to make it easier to remember is to create a visual reminder for yourself, like a post-it note on your computer or a screensaver on your phone with a self-compassionate phrase or mantra. What's a phrase or mantra that resonates with you?\n\nPatient: Hmm, maybe something like \"Rest is not a reward, it's a requirement.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great mantra! It emphasizes the importance of rest and self-care as essential components of productivity and well-being, rather than something you have to earn. Let's make that your mantra for the week. Try writing it on a post-it note or setting it as your phone background, and when you see it, take a moment to practice self-compassionate reframing. We can start practicing that together now. Can you think of a situation this week where you might need to practice self-compassionate reframing?\n\nPatient: Well, I have a big project due next Friday, and I'm already feeling anxious about getting it done on time. I know I'll probably need to work late some nights, but I also want to make sure I'm taking breaks and not burning myself out.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's practice self-compassionate reframing for that situation. What's a thought you might have when you're feeling anxious about the project?\n\nPatient: I might think something like, \"I have to work late every night this week to get this project done, or else I'll be seen as incompetent.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's reframe that thought in a more self-compassionate way. What's a kinder, more balanced thought you could have instead?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I can work hard on this project while also prioritizing my well-being. Taking breaks and getting enough rest will actually help me do my best work.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe! It acknowledges the importance of the project while also prioritizing your well-being. Remember, self-compassion isn't about letting yourself off the hook or shirking responsibility. It's about treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would extend to others. As you work on this project next week, try to practice self-compassionate reframing whenever you notice yourself feeling anxious or overwhelmed. And remember your mantra, \"Rest is not a reward, it's a requirement.\"",
