  "transcript": "Patient: The worry time technique sounds interesting. I like the idea of having a designated time to address my concerns, so they don't keep me up at night. Can you explain a bit more about how it works?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, I'd be happy to walk you through it in more detail. The basic idea behind worry time is to create a dedicated space in your day to focus on any worries or concerns that are on your mind. By setting aside this specific time, you're giving yourself permission to let those worries go at other times, like when you're trying to fall asleep.\n\nHere's how you can put it into practice:\n\n1. Choose a specific time during the day, ideally well before bedtime, to be your designated \"worry time.\" It could be right after dinner, or maybe in the late afternoon. Try to pick a time when you can consistently set aside 15-20 minutes without interruptions.\n\n2. During your worry time, sit down with a notebook or journal and write down any concerns or worries that are on your mind. Don't censor yourself - just let the thoughts flow onto the page. \n\n3. For each worry, try to brainstorm some potential solutions or next steps. Even if you can't solve the problem entirely, just having a plan of action can help reduce the anxiety around it.\n\n4. Once your worry time is up, close the notebook and give yourself permission to let those concerns go until the next day's worry time. If a worry pops up outside of your designated time, gently remind yourself that you've already addressed it and will have a chance to revisit it tomorrow.\n\nThe key is to be consistent with the practice. It might feel a bit strange at first, but over time, your brain starts to learn that there's a specific time and place for worrying, which can help reduce the anxiety that keeps you up at night.\n\nWhat do you think? Is that something you'd be willing to try this week, in addition to the relaxation techniques we've already discussed?",
