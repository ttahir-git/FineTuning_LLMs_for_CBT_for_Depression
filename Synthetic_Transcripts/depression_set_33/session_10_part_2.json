  "transcript": "Patient: I think I'd like to focus on my work project and the cognitive and behavioral experiment we designed last session. I've been struggling with self-doubt and feeling overwhelmed, so I think that's a priority for me.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan, Amira. Let's start by reviewing your experience with the cognitive and behavioral experiment related to your work project. Can you walk me through how it went and what insights you gained from it?\n\nPatient: Well, the experiment was to break down the project into smaller tasks and focus on completing one task at a time, instead of getting overwhelmed by the entire project. I also tried to challenge my negative thoughts about not being capable enough to handle the project.\n\nTherapist: That's a great start. Breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps is an effective way to combat feelings of overwhelm. How did you find the process of challenging your negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: It was difficult at first because I'm so used to doubting myself. But I tried to look at the evidence objectively, like we discussed. I reminded myself of past projects I've successfully completed and the skills I've developed over the years. It helped a bit, but I still struggled with self-doubt.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that challenging long-held negative beliefs can be difficult. The fact that you're aware of these thoughts and are making efforts to challenge them is a significant step forward. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a specific negative thought you had about the project and how you tried to challenge it?\n\nPatient: One thought that kept coming up was, \"I'm going to fail at this project, and everyone will see that I'm not capable.\" I tried to challenge it by reminding myself of my past successes and the positive feedback I've received from colleagues. But the thought kept lingering.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Amira. It shows how deeply ingrained some of these negative beliefs can be. When challenging negative thoughts, it's essential to look at the evidence objectively, as you did. However, sometimes we need to dig a little deeper to uncover the underlying beliefs that fuel these thoughts.\n\nLet's use the downward arrow technique to explore this further. When you have the thought, \"I'm going to fail at this project, and everyone will see that I'm not capable,\" what do you think that means about you?\n\nPatient: It means that I'm not good enough, that I don't have what it takes to succeed in my career.\n\nTherapist: And if that were true, that you're not good enough and don't have what it takes to succeed, what would that mean about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm a failure, that I'm not worthy of respect or admiration.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Amira. What you've just identified is a core belief \u2013 the underlying belief that drives many of your negative thoughts and feelings. The belief that you're a failure or not worthy is a common theme that we've been working on challenging throughout our sessions.\n\nNow that we've identified this core belief, we can work on reframing it in a more balanced and adaptive way. Let's start by looking at the evidence that contradicts this belief. What are some examples of times when you've succeeded or demonstrated your capabilities, both in your career and personal life?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been in my current job for over 15 years, and I've received multiple promotions and positive performance reviews. I've also taken on leadership roles in my community and received recognition for my volunteer work. And on a personal level, I've maintained my sobriety for 15 years, which is a significant accomplishment.\n\nTherapist: Those are all excellent examples, Amira. They demonstrate your capabilities, resilience, and the positive impact you've had on others. When we look at the evidence objectively, it's clear that the belief that you're a failure or not worthy is not accurate or fair.\n\nAs we continue to challenge this core belief, it's essential to practice self-compassion and recognize that everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Making mistakes or facing challenges does not define your worth as a person.\n\nPatient: I understand that logically, but it's hard to internalize it emotionally.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience, Amira. Challenging deeply held beliefs takes time and practice. One way to reinforce new, more adaptive beliefs is through a positive data log. This involves actively looking for and recording evidence that supports the new belief.\n\nFor example, you could create a log where you write down instances of your successes, positive feedback, or moments when you demonstrated your capabilities. By actively focusing on this evidence, you can start to shift your perspective and build a more balanced view of yourself.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can try to start a positive data log and make a conscious effort to record evidence that challenges my negative beliefs.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Amira. Remember, the goal is not to ignore or suppress negative thoughts but to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective. As we continue to work on reframing your core beliefs, you'll likely find it easier to challenge negative thoughts and build resilience against self-doubt.\n\nLet's also discuss how you can apply this reframing to your work project. When you notice yourself having negative thoughts about your capabilities, try to pause and examine the evidence objectively. Remind yourself of your past successes and the skills you bring to the project.\n\nPatient: I'll try to do that. It's just difficult when I'm in the midst of feeling overwhelmed and stressed.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. In those moments, it can be helpful to have a go-to coping statement or mantra that you can repeat to yourself. This could be something like, \"I am capable and have overcome challenges before,\" or \"I am worthy regardless of the outcome of this project.\"\n\nHaving a pre-planned statement can help interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts and remind you of your strengths and resilience.",
