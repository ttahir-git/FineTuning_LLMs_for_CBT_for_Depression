I know it won't be easy, but I'm hopeful that it will help me feel better in the long run.\n\nTherapist: Your willingness to engage in the therapy process is a great sign, Amira. It shows that you're committed to making positive changes in your life, even though it might be challenging at times.\n\nAs we move forward, we'll work together to set specific goals for your therapy. These goals will be based on your unique needs and priorities, and they'll help guide our work together.\n\nSome potential goals might include:\n\n1. Developing more balanced and realistic thinking patterns\n2. Increasing engagement in pleasurable and meaningful activities\n3. Improving your sleep quality and establishing a consistent self-care routine\n4. Addressing unresolved grief related to your father's passing\n5. Building a more balanced relationship with your work and setting boundaries to prevent burnout\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these potential goals?
