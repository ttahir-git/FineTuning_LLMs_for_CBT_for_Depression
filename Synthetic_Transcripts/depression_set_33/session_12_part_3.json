  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you've been feeling more drained after social interactions, even positive ones. Can you tell me more about that experience and how it relates to your thoughts and feelings?\n\nPatient: Well, I've always been a bit of an introvert, but lately, it seems like even small social interactions leave me feeling exhausted. I had lunch with a colleague last week, and even though we had a nice time, I felt so drained afterwards that I had to go home and take a nap.\n\nTherapist: It's interesting that you bring up the connection between your social interactions and your energy levels. In CBT, we often talk about the relationship between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. How do you think your thoughts might be influencing your experience of social interactions?\n\nPatient: I guess I often worry that I'm not being interesting or engaging enough in conversations. I tend to overthink everything I say and do, and that can be mentally exhausting.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. It sounds like you might be experiencing some cognitive distortions, like mind reading or fortune telling, where you assume that others are judging you negatively without any real evidence. This can lead to feelings of anxiety and drain your energy.\n\nPatient: Yeah, that makes sense. I've never really thought about it that way before.\n\nTherapist: One way to start challenging these distortions is to look for evidence that contradicts them. For example, you mentioned that you had a nice time with your colleague at lunch. What evidence do you have that they enjoyed your company and found you interesting?\n\nPatient: Well, they did ask me a lot of questions about my work and seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say. And they suggested that we should do it again sometime.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the distortion that you're not interesting or engaging enough. By focusing on the evidence that contradicts your negative thoughts, you can start to shift your perspective and reduce the mental exhaustion that comes with overthinking social interactions.\n\nPatient: That makes a lot of sense. I guess I need to practice being more aware of those distortions and challenging them in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. It's a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the easier it becomes. Another helpful technique is to set realistic goals for social interactions and focus on the present moment instead of worrying about how you're being perceived.\n\nPatient: Can you give me an example of a realistic goal for a social interaction?\n\nTherapist: Sure. Let's say you're going to a work event where you don't know many people. A realistic goal might be to introduce yourself to one new person and ask them about their work or interests. By setting a specific, achievable goal, you can focus on the present moment and the connection you're making, rather than getting caught up in worries about how you're being perceived.\n\nPatient: That seems a lot more manageable than trying to be the life of the party or impress everyone I meet.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By setting realistic goals and focusing on the present moment, you can reduce the mental exhaustion that comes with overthinking social interactions. And over time, as you build confidence in your social skills, you may find that social interactions become less draining and more enjoyable.\n\nPatient: I'm definitely going to try that. I think it could make a big difference in how I approach social situations.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps. You don't have to change everything overnight. The important thing is to be aware of your thoughts and feelings, and to practice challenging the distortions that are holding you back.",
