  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I had a thought the other day that really stuck with me. I was feeling overwhelmed at work and thinking about all the tasks I had to complete. The thought that kept running through my head was, \"I'll never be able to get all of this done. I'm going to fail.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, and a common type of thought that many people struggle with. Let's break it down using the thought record. First, can you tell me about the emotions you were feeling when you had that thought, and how intense they were on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I was feeling anxious, maybe around 80, and also a bit hopeless, like a 60.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have the situation, which was feeling overwhelmed at work, the emotions of anxiety at 80 and hopelessness at 60, and the automatic thought, \"I'll never be able to get all of this done. I'm going to fail.\" What did you put in the evidence for and against columns?\n\nPatient: For evidence for the thought, I wrote that I have a lot of tasks to complete and not enough time. I also wrote that I've struggled to keep up with work lately. For evidence against, I put that I've been able to manage my workload in the past, and that I have a supportive team I can rely on.\n\nTherapist: Good. Now, based on that evidence, what was the alternative thought you came up with?\n\nPatient: I wrote, \"I'm feeling overwhelmed right now, but I've been able to handle my workload before. I can prioritize my tasks and ask for help if I need it. I may not get everything done perfectly, but that doesn't mean I'm a failure.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges the difficulty of the situation while also recognizing your past successes and the resources you have available. How did your emotions change after coming up with that alternative thought?\n\nPatient: My anxiety went down to about a 50, and my hopelessness went down to a 30.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant change. This is a great example of how challenging our thoughts can help shift our emotions. It's not about ignoring the difficulties or challenges, but about finding a more balanced and realistic perspective.\n\nPatient: I can see that. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment when I'm feeling really overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge. One thing that can help is to practice the thought records regularly, even when you're not feeling particularly distressed. The more you practice, the more automatic the process becomes. We can also look at some other techniques for managing overwhelming emotions in the moment, like distress tolerance skills.\n\nPatient: What are distress tolerance skills?\n\nTherapist: Distress tolerance skills are techniques that help you manage intense emotions in the moment, without making the situation worse. They're not about solving the problem or getting rid of the emotion completely, but about helping you get through a difficult moment without engaging in unhelpful behaviors, like avoidance or substance use.\n\nSome examples of distress tolerance skills include deep breathing, grounding exercises, and mindfulness. With deep breathing, you focus on taking slow, deep breaths, which can help calm your body's physiological response to stress. Grounding exercises involve focusing on your senses, like noticing five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can help you feel more present and less caught up in your thoughts.\n\nMindfulness involves observing your thoughts and emotions without judgment, and without getting caught up in them. You might imagine your thoughts as leaves floating down a stream, or as clouds passing by in the sky. The idea is to notice them without getting pulled into the story they're telling.\n\nDoes this make sense? Do you think any of these techniques might be helpful for you?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of deep breathing and grounding. I've tried mindfulness before, but I find it really hard not to get caught up in my thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience with mindfulness. It's a skill that takes practice, and it's okay if it's challenging at first. We can start with some shorter, more structured mindfulness exercises and work our way up. The key is to be patient with yourself and not judge yourself if your mind wanders. That's just part of the process.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's set a goal for you to practice one of these distress tolerance skills each day, in addition to the thought records. You can start with deep breathing or grounding, and we can introduce some mindfulness exercises as we go along.\n\nPatient: That sounds manageable. I'll try to do the deep breathing before bed, since that's when my thoughts tend to get really loud.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea. Practicing these skills at a consistent time each day can help make them a habit. And if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed during the day, you can use them as needed to help manage your emotions in the moment.\n\nPatient: I'll give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Remember, it's okay if it feels challenging at first. The more you practice, the easier it will become. And we'll keep working on these skills together in our sessions.\n\nLet's revisit the other homework tasks we discussed last time, around engaging in activities that honor your father's memory, establishing a consistent sleep schedule, and identifying hobbies or interests to engage in. How did those go?",
