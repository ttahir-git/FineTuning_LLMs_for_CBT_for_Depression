  "transcript": "Patient: I have considered opening up more to Lina and my other friends, but it's scary. I don't want them to see me as weak or broken.\n\nTherapist: It's a common fear to worry about being seen as weak or broken when struggling with mental health issues. But in reality, reaching out for help and being vulnerable takes a lot of strength and courage. Your friends care about you and want to support you, just as you would for them if the roles were reversed.\n\nPatient: You're right. I would want my friends to lean on me if they were going through a tough time. I guess I just need to get over my own fears and pride.\n\nTherapist: That's a great realization, Amira. Opening up to your friends could provide you with additional support and help you feel less alone in your struggles. Aside from your friends, have you ever sought professional help for your depression before?\n\nPatient: No, this is my first time seeking therapy for depression. I've been hesitant to reach out for professional help in the past, partly because of the stigma around mental health in my culture. But I know I can't keep going on like this, so I figured it was time to give therapy a try.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that cultural stigma can make it difficult to seek help, but I'm glad you've decided to prioritize your mental health and well-being. Since this is your first time in therapy for depression, what are some of your hopes and expectations for our work together?\n\nPatient: I'm hoping to gain a better understanding of my depression and learn some healthy coping mechanisms. I want to find ways to manage my symptoms so that I can get back to enjoying my life and feeling like myself again. I'm also hoping to work through some of the unresolved grief around my father's death.\n\nTherapist: Those are all great goals for therapy, and I'm confident that we can work together to help you achieve them. As we continue with our assessment, I'll be gathering more information about your experiences, challenges, and strengths, which will help me develop a personalized treatment plan for you.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm ready to dive in and start working on these issues.",
