  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amira, it's great to see you again for session 10. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or notable experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like the worry time and positive data log. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood. I'm still struggling with low energy and motivation, especially when it comes to work. I often feel overwhelmed and doubt my abilities.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. It's a positive step in the right direction. I understand that low energy and motivation, particularly related to work, are still challenging for you. Let's make sure to address these concerns today.\n\nBefore we dive in, let's set an agenda for our session. I'd like to review your experience with the homework assignments, especially the cognitive and behavioral experiment related to your work project. We can also continue practicing thought records and reframing core beliefs. What would you like to prioritize today?",
