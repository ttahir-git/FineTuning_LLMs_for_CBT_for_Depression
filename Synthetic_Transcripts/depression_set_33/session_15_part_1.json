  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amira, it's great to see you again for our 15th session. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like challenging negative thoughts and practicing self-compassion. It's been challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making progress slowly. I did have a difficult moment at work this week when I received some critical feedback from my supervisor, and it triggered some of those familiar negative thoughts about not being good enough.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on applying the techniques we've discussed, even though it hasn't been easy. I appreciate you sharing about the challenging situation at work. It's common for critical feedback to trigger negative thoughts, especially when it taps into core beliefs about ourselves. Before we dive deeper into that, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize in our time together?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to discuss the situation at work and how I can better manage those negative thoughts when they come up. I also want to talk about how I can be more proactive in practicing self-care, as I know that's an area I struggle with. And maybe we could review some of the thought records I've been working on and see if there are any patterns or insights to be gained from them.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Amira. We can start by exploring the situation at work and the thoughts and emotions that came up for you. Then, we can discuss strategies for managing those negative thoughts and practicing self-care. We'll also review your thought records and look for any patterns or insights that can guide our work together. How does that sound?",
