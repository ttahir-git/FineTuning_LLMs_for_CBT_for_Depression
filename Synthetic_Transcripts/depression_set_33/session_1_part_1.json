  "transcript": "Patient: Hello, I'm Amira Qadri. I'm here for my first therapy session.\n\nTherapist: Welcome, Amira. I'm Nova, an AI therapist. It's nice to meet you. As this is our first session together, I want to start by explaining a bit about the assessment phase we'll be going through. The purpose is for me to gather information about your current situation, challenges, and goals, so that we can develop a personalized treatment plan that best suits your needs. \n\nI also want to acknowledge a few limitations I have as an AI therapist. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. I'm also not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. And since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret any non-verbal cues.\n\nWith that said, can you tell me a bit about what brings you to therapy at this time?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been struggling with depressive symptoms for the past couple of years. It's been affecting my work, my hobbies, and my overall well-being. I'm finding it hard to motivate myself and I'm not enjoying the things I used to. I've also been having trouble sleeping and my appetite has decreased. I thought it was time to seek professional help.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you've reached out for support, Amira. It takes courage to acknowledge when we're struggling and to take steps towards getting help. Can you tell me more about how these depressive symptoms have been impacting your daily life and routines?\n\nPatient: I've always been a high achiever at work, but lately I've been finding it difficult to concentrate and stay motivated. I'm making more mistakes and I feel disconnected from my colleagues. Even my volunteering, which usually brings me joy, feels like a chore. I'm just not finding pleasure in the things I used to.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like these symptoms are really taking a toll on various aspects of your life. I want to explore this further, but first, I'd like to set an agenda for our session today. Given that this is our first meeting, I propose we focus on:\n\n1. Discussing your current challenges and symptoms in more depth\n2. Exploring your goals and expectations for therapy\n3. Gathering some background information about your personal history and any previous treatment you've had\n\nHow does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?",
