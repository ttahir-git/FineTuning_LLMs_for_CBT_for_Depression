  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amira, it's great to see you again for session 19. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say, as I can't directly observe non-verbal cues. If you ever feel that I'm not understanding you correctly, please let me know so we can clarify. Also, please remember that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a mental health emergency, it's essential to reach out to a qualified professional or helpline for immediate support.\n\nWith that said, let's start by checking in on how you've been doing since our last session. How have you been feeling, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice self-compassionate reframing, especially during the presentation on Wednesday and while working on the project due next Friday. It hasn't been easy, but I've noticed a slight shift in my inner dialogue. I'm still struggling with prioritizing rest and self-care, though. Work has been particularly demanding this week, and I find myself slipping back into old patterns of overworking and neglecting my needs.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing self-compassionate reframing and noticing some changes in your inner dialogue. It's a process, and it's normal to face challenges along the way, especially when it comes to balancing work demands and self-care. Let's explore this further during our session today.\n\nFor our agenda, I propose we start by discussing your experiences with self-compassionate reframing and any challenges or insights that came up during the week. We can then explore the obstacles you're facing with prioritizing rest and self-care and work on developing strategies to address them. I'd also like to spend some time reviewing your progress with thought records and discussing any work-related situations that have been particularly challenging. Finally, we can introduce a new technique called \"coping cards\" to support you in reinforcing adaptive thoughts and self-compassion. How does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?\n\nPatient: The agenda sounds good, Nova. I agree that we should focus on self-compassionate reframing and the challenges I'm facing with rest and self-care. I'm also interested in learning about coping cards and how they can help me maintain the progress I've made. One thing I'd like to add to the agenda is discussing how I can better manage my workload and set boundaries at work without feeling guilty or like I'm not doing enough.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent addition to our agenda, Amira. Learning to set boundaries and manage your workload in a way that aligns with your well-being is crucial, especially given the demands of your job. We'll definitely explore this further and work on developing strategies that feel authentic and manageable for you.\n\nLet's start by discussing your experiences with self-compassionate reframing over the past week. Can you share a specific situation where you practiced this technique and how it impacted your thoughts and emotions?",
