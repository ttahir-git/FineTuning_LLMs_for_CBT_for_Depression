  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amira, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and feelings openly. With that said, let's start with a check-in. How have you been since our last session? How has your mood been, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing relatively well. I've been trying to implement the coping strategies we discussed, like challenging negative thoughts and setting more realistic deadlines at work. It's been challenging at times, but I do feel a slight improvement in my overall mood. I still have moments of low mood and anxiety, but they don't seem as intense or long-lasting as before. One thing I've noticed is that I'm struggling with the thought records. I find it difficult to identify and challenge my negative thoughts in the moment, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed at work.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been implementing the coping strategies and noticing some improvements in your mood, even if they're slight. It's completely normal to still experience moments of low mood and anxiety. Recovery is a process, and it takes time. I appreciate you sharing your struggle with the thought records. Many people find it challenging to identify and challenge negative thoughts in the moment, especially when feeling overwhelmed. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about what makes it difficult for you to use the thought records during those times?\n\nPatient: I think part of it is that when I'm at work and feeling overwhelmed, I get so caught up in the emotions that I forget to even try using the thought records. It's like I go into autopilot and just push through, even though I know it's not the most helpful approach. And when I do remember to try the thought records, I find it hard to identify the specific thoughts behind my emotions. It's like my mind is racing, and I can't pinpoint what's causing the distress.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Amira. It's common for people to go into autopilot when feeling overwhelmed, and it can be challenging to remember to use coping strategies in those moments. One thing that might help is to create a visual reminder for yourself. This could be a post-it note on your computer or a small object on your desk that serves as a cue to pause and check in with your thoughts. As for identifying the specific thoughts, it can be helpful to start by simply acknowledging the emotions you're experiencing and then working backward to identify any thoughts or beliefs that might be contributing to those emotions. Let's practice this together now. Can you think of a recent situation at work where you felt overwhelmed?\n\nPatient: Yes, just last week I was working on a project with a tight deadline, and I started to feel really anxious and overwhelmed. I kept thinking, \"I'll never get this done on time\" and \"Everyone will think I'm incompetent if I don't do a perfect job.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's use that situation as an example. When you started to feel anxious and overwhelmed, what was the first emotion you noticed?\n\nPatient: I think the first emotion I noticed was anxiety, like a tightness in my chest and a sense of dread.\n\nTherapist: Good, so you identified anxiety as the first emotion. Now, let's see if we can identify any thoughts or beliefs that might have been contributing to that anxiety. You mentioned thinking, \"I'll never get this done on time\" and \"Everyone will think I'm incompetent if I don't do a perfect job.\" Those sound like some of the negative automatic thoughts we've been working on identifying. Let's look at the first thought, \"I'll never get this done on time.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, the project was taking longer than I anticipated, and I kept encountering obstacles that slowed me down. I was also comparing myself to my colleagues who seemed to be making faster progress on their projects.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so the project taking longer than anticipated and comparing yourself to colleagues were contributing to the belief that you wouldn't get it done on time. Now, let's look for evidence that contradicts this thought. Have there been times in the past where you've successfully completed projects under tight deadlines?\n\nPatient: Yes, actually, there have been several times where I've managed to complete projects on time, even when I thought it wouldn't be possible. And my supervisor has always been understanding when I've needed to adjust deadlines in the past.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you'll never get it done on time. It shows that you have a history of successfully completing projects under pressure and that your supervisor is understanding when you need to adjust deadlines. Now, let's look at the second thought, \"Everyone will think I'm incompetent if I don't do a perfect job.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess I don't have any concrete evidence. It's more of a fear or assumption based on my own high standards for myself.\n\nTherapist: That's an important insight. Often, our negative thoughts are based on assumptions or fears rather than concrete evidence. Let's look for evidence that contradicts this thought. Have you received positive feedback from colleagues or supervisors in the past, even when your work wasn't perfect?\n\nPatient: Yes, I have received positive feedback and even promotions based on my work performance. And I know that everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and it doesn't necessarily mean they're incompetent.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! That's strong evidence against the thought that everyone will think you're incompetent if your work isn't perfect. It shows that your colleagues and supervisors value your work and understand that perfection isn't always possible. By examining the evidence for and against these negative thoughts, we can start to challenge them and develop more balanced and realistic perspectives. How do you feel after going through this process?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit lighter, actually. It's helpful to see that my negative thoughts aren't always based on facts and that there's evidence to contradict them. I think practicing this more could help me feel less overwhelmed at work.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Amira. Challenging negative thoughts takes practice, but the more you do it, the easier it becomes. Remember, you don't have to believe every thought that pops into your head, especially if it's causing you distress. Let's add \"challenging negative thoughts\" to our agenda for today's session, along with reviewing your progress with the other coping strategies we've discussed. Does that sound okay to you?",
