  "transcript": "Patient: I like the idea of coping cards. Having a physical reminder of the things we've been working on could be really helpful, especially in those moments when I'm feeling overwhelmed and struggling to prioritize self-care.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find the idea of coping cards appealing, Amira. They can be a powerful tool for reinforcing the skills and insights you've gained throughout our work together. Let's take a few minutes to create some coping cards that feel meaningful and relevant to you.\n\nTo start, think about some of the key messages or phrases that have resonated with you during our sessions. These could be related to self-compassion, challenging perfectionistic thoughts, or prioritizing rest and self-care. What are some messages you'd like to have on your coping cards?\n\nPatient: One message that stands out is \"Progress, not perfection.\" It reminds me that I don't have to be flawless to be worthy of love and respect, and that small steps forward are still valuable. Another message I'd like to include is \"Rest is not a reward, it's a requirement,\" which we've discussed before. It helps me challenge the idea that I only deserve breaks when I've earned them through hard work.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent messages to include on your coping cards, Amira. They directly challenge some of the core beliefs and intermediate beliefs we've identified, such as the idea that your worth is tied to your productivity or that rest is a luxury rather than a necessity.\n\nAnother aspect to consider including on your coping cards is reminders of your personal strengths and resilience factors. These can help counterbalance the negative thoughts and provide a more balanced perspective. What are some of your personal strengths or positive qualities that you'd like to remind yourself of?\n\nPatient: One of my strengths is my ability to problem-solve and think critically, even in high-pressure situations. I'd like to remind myself that I have the skills and resources to handle challenges, even if they feel overwhelming in the moment. Another strength is my adaptability \u2013 I've navigated significant life changes and challenges, like moving to a new country and overcoming substance abuse, which shows that I have the resilience to grow and thrive in the face of adversity.\n\nTherapist: Those are significant strengths, Amira, and they're absolutely worth acknowledging and reminding yourself of regularly. Your problem-solving skills and adaptability have served you well in many areas of your life, and they can also be powerful allies in your journey towards better mental health and self-care.\n\nAs you create your coping cards, consider including reminders of these strengths alongside the messages we discussed earlier. You might write something like, \"I am a skilled problem-solver with the ability to navigate challenges. I can apply these skills to my mental health journey.\" Or, \"I have overcome significant obstacles in the past, which shows my resilience and adaptability. I trust in my ability to grow and thrive.\"\n\nWhat do you think about including reminders of your strengths on your coping cards?\n\nPatient: I think that's a great idea, Nova. Having reminders of my strengths alongside the messages we've been working on could help me feel more empowered and capable, even in moments when I'm struggling. It's easy to forget about my strengths when I'm feeling overwhelmed or stuck in negative thought patterns.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Amira. Having a tangible reminder of your strengths can help counterbalance the negative thoughts and provide a more balanced, realistic perspective. It's about recognizing that while you may face challenges, you also have significant inner resources to draw upon.\n\nAs you create your coping cards, remember that they can be a work in progress. You can always add to them or adapt them as you continue to grow and gain new insights. The key is to make them feel personal and meaningful to you, so that they resonate with you in moments when you need them most.\n\nWith that in mind, let's shift gears a bit and discuss how you can better manage your workload and set boundaries at work without feeling guilty or like you're not doing enough. This ties into our discussion about prioritizing rest and self-care, as well as challenging some of those perfectionistic thoughts and beliefs.\n\nCan you share a specific situation at work where you struggled to set boundaries or prioritize your well-being?",
