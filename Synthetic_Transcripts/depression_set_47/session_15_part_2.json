  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you taking the time to understand my challenges and helping me work through them. It's been a difficult journey, but I'm starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're starting to see some progress, Samirah. It takes a lot of courage and strength to face these challenges head-on, and you're doing a great job. Let's dive into your sleep issues and see if we can develop a plan to improve your sleep hygiene and establish a more consistent routine. Can you tell me more about your current sleep patterns and what you think might be contributing to your difficulties with sleep?\n\nPatient: Well, I often find myself staying up late, either working on job applications or just scrolling through social media. I know it's not healthy, but it's like I can't shut off my brain. Then, when I finally do go to bed, I toss and turn for hours, worrying about the future and ruminating on past mistakes. I usually end up sleeping in late, which makes it harder to get started on my day.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a really frustrating cycle, and it's one that many people with depression struggle with. The good news is that there are some strategies we can use to help break that cycle and improve your sleep. One of the key things is establishing a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends. This means going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even if you don't feel tired or think you need more sleep.\n\nPatient: That makes sense, but it's easier said than done. How do I convince my brain to shut off and stick to a schedule?\n\nTherapist: That's a great question, and it's one that requires a multi-pronged approach. In addition to setting a consistent sleep schedule, we can also work on creating a relaxing bedtime routine, limiting screen time before bed, and practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. We can also look at your sleep environment and see if there are any changes we can make to promote better sleep, like keeping your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.\n\nPatient: Those sound like good ideas, but I'm worried I won't be able to stick to them. I've tried setting a sleep schedule before, but I always seem to fall back into old habits.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's something we can address through cognitive restructuring. When you find yourself struggling to stick to your sleep schedule or engaging in unhealthy sleep habits, what thoughts go through your mind?\n\nPatient: I guess I start thinking things like, \"I'm never going to be able to fall asleep anyway, so what's the point?\" or \"I need to stay up and finish this application, even if it means sacrificing sleep.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of negative thoughts that might be contributing to your sleep difficulties. Let's look at them through the lens of cognitive restructuring. What would be the evidence for and against those thoughts?\n\nPatient: Well, the evidence for the first thought is that I have had trouble falling asleep in the past. But the evidence against it is that I haven't really given a consistent sleep schedule a fair shot, and there are things I can do to improve my chances of falling asleep, like the strategies you mentioned. As for the second thought, the evidence for it is that I do need to work on job applications. But the evidence against it is that sacrificing sleep is likely to make me less productive and more prone to mistakes in the long run.\n\nTherapist: That's some great cognitive restructuring, Samirah! You're doing a great job of looking at your thoughts objectively and considering the evidence for and against them. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to challenge those negative thoughts and replace them with more balanced, helpful ones. This can help you stick to your sleep schedule and prioritize your health and well-being.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your guidance and support. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see how changing my thoughts can help me change my behaviors and improve my overall mental health.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Samirah. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. But by consistently practicing these skills and techniques, you're building a strong foundation for lasting change. Let's keep working on developing a personalized sleep plan for you, and we can revisit this topic in future sessions to track your progress and make any necessary adjustments.",
