  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I think it covers the main areas I've been struggling with lately. I don't have anything else to add at the moment.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by exploring the thoughts and feelings that have been contributing to your low motivation and sleep difficulties. Can you share some examples of specific situations where you've noticed these challenges arising?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been struggling to find the motivation to work on my job applications and reach out to potential employers. I know I need to be proactive, but I keep putting it off. And at night, I often find myself lying in bed for hours, unable to fall asleep because my mind is racing with worries and negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing those examples, Samirah. Let's focus on the job application process first. When you think about working on your applications, what thoughts come to mind? Try to identify any automatic thoughts or beliefs that might be influencing your motivation.\n\nPatient: I guess I have thoughts like, \"I'm not qualified enough for these positions,\" or \"They'll probably just reject me anyway.\" It feels like there's no point in trying because I'm just setting myself up for failure.\n\nTherapist: Those are some powerful automatic thoughts that could definitely impact your motivation. Let's examine them more closely. When you have the thought, \"I'm not qualified enough for these positions,\" what emotions do you experience?\n\nPatient: I feel discouraged, hopeless, and a bit anxious. It's like I'm already anticipating the rejection before it even happens.\n\nTherapist: And how do those emotions influence your behavior? What do you typically do when you feel discouraged and hopeless about the job application process?\n\nPatient: I usually end up procrastinating or avoiding the applications altogether. I might distract myself with other tasks or just spend hours scrolling through social media instead.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. The thought \"I'm not qualified enough\" leads to feelings of discouragement and hopelessness, which then contribute to the behavior of procrastination and avoidance. This cycle can be challenging to break, but that's where our CBT skills come in. Let's try to reframe that automatic thought using some cognitive restructuring techniques. What's an alternative, more balanced thought you could have about your qualifications for these positions?",
