I feel more hopeful after our session today. I know it won't be easy, but I'm committed to doing the work.\n\nTherapist: Before we wrap up, I want to assign some homework for you to practice between sessions.

Let's take a moment to check in on your current mood and any final thoughts before we end our session today.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also more hopeful and motivated than when we started. I know I have a lot of work to do, but I feel more equipped to handle it now.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Samirah. Remember to be kind and compassionate with yourself as you navigate this journey. Progress takes time, and every small step counts. I'm proud of the work you've done today and the commitment you've shown to your well-being.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. Your support means a lot to me.
