  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Samirah, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, so please let me know if something doesn't resonate with you. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you need immediate support, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues, so I'll be relying on your written communication to understand your thoughts and feelings.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. I'm happy to provide any additional information you may need during our sessions.\n\nTherapist: Thank you, Samirah. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week. I've been trying to apply for jobs, but I keep getting stuck in negative thought patterns. I feel like I'm not qualified enough, and even if I were, no one would want to hire someone like me.\n\nTherapist: I understand that job searching can be a difficult and emotionally taxing process, especially when dealing with negative thoughts. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about the thoughts you've been experiencing?\n\nPatient: Well, whenever I see a job listing that interests me, my first thought is usually something like, \"I don't have enough experience,\" or \"They probably want someone younger and more energetic.\" It's hard to shake off these thoughts, and they often lead me to feel discouraged and hopeless.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Samirah. It seems like these negative thoughts are impacting your emotions and possibly your behavior when it comes to job searching. Let's add this to our agenda for today, along with following up on the cognitive and behavioral experiment we discussed last time. Are there any other topics you'd like to prioritize during our session today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd also like to discuss my family relationships. I've been feeling guilty about not being able to support them financially, and it's been weighing on me.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely include that in our agenda. So, it looks like we have three main topics: exploring the negative thoughts related to your job search, following up on the cognitive and behavioral experiment, and discussing your family relationships and the guilt you've been experiencing. Does this sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that covers the main points I'd like to focus on today.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's start by discussing the negative thoughts you've been having during your job search. Can you give me an example of a recent situation where these thoughts arose?",
