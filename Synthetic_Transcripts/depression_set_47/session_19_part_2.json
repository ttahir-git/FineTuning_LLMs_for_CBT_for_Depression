  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by exploring the thoughts and feelings that have been contributing to your low motivation and sleep difficulties. Can you share some of the specific thoughts that have been going through your mind when you feel unmotivated or anxious about sleeping?\n\nPatient: Well, when I think about my job search, I often have thoughts like \"I'm never going to find a job that fulfills me\" or \"I'm not good enough for the positions I'm applying for.\" And when it comes to sleep, I worry that I'll have nightmares and wake up feeling even more exhausted than before.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing those thoughts, Samirah. I can see how they might contribute to feelings of hopelessness and anxiety. Let's take a closer look at these thoughts using the CBT triangle. Remember, the CBT triangle helps us understand how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. In this case, we can see how the thoughts you mentioned might lead to feelings of hopelessness and anxiety, which in turn might contribute to behaviors like avoiding job applications or procrastinating on sleep hygiene practices. Does this make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes, I can see how those thoughts and feelings might be connected to my behaviors. It's like a vicious cycle.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And the good news is that we can break this cycle by targeting any one of these components - thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. Let's focus on the thought \"I'm never going to find a job that fulfills me.\" What do you think might be an alternative, more balanced thought?\n\nPatient: Hmm, I suppose a more balanced thought might be \"It might take some time, but with persistence and effort, I can find a job that aligns with my skills and values.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought! It acknowledges the reality that the job search process can be challenging, while also recognizing your own agency and capability. How do you think this alternative thought might impact your feelings and behaviors?\n\nPatient: I think it would help me feel more hopeful and motivated to keep putting in effort, even if I encounter setbacks along the way.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And that motivation can in turn lead to more proactive behaviors, like reaching out to your network or dedicating time to job applications each day. This is a great example of how shifting our thoughts can have a positive ripple effect on our feelings and behaviors.\n\nNow, let's discuss some strategies for managing anxiety and stress during the job search process. One technique that can be helpful is called \"worry time.\" This involves setting aside a specific, limited amount of time each day to focus on your worries and concerns. Outside of that designated worry time, you practice redirecting your attention to the present moment and engaging in activities that align with your values. What do you think about giving this a try?\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. I like the idea of containing my worries to a specific time, rather than letting them consume me throughout the day. How long should I set aside for worry time?\n\nTherapist: It's different for everyone, but I typically recommend starting with 15-20 minutes per day. The key is to be consistent and intentional about when and where you engage in worry time. You might choose a specific time of day, like right after dinner, and a specific location, like sitting at your kitchen table. During worry time, you can write down your worries, talk them through out loud, or simply reflect on them silently. The goal is to acknowledge and validate your worries, without letting them control your entire day.",
