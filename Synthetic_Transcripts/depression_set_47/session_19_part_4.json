  "transcript": "Patient: When I think about ending therapy, I feel a mix of emotions. On one hand, I feel proud of the progress I've made and excited to continue using the skills I've learned on my own. But on the other hand, I feel a bit nervous and uncertain about navigating challenges without your support.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions as we approach the end of therapy. It's a significant transition, and it's natural to feel both a sense of accomplishment and some apprehension about the future. Let's explore these emotions a bit further.\n\nWhat specific thoughts come up for you when you feel nervous about ending therapy?\n\nPatient: I guess I worry that without our regular sessions, I might start to slip back into old patterns and habits. I worry that I won't be able to maintain the progress I've made on my own.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid concerns, and I'm glad you're sharing them openly. It's true that ending therapy can feel like a big change, and it's normal to worry about maintaining progress. That's why we'll spend our remaining sessions focusing on consolidating your skills and developing a plan for continued growth and maintenance after therapy ends.\n\nRemember, you've already demonstrated a great ability to apply CBT skills independently between our sessions. You've been practicing behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and relaxation techniques on your own, and you've made significant progress in managing your depression symptoms. That's a testament to your resilience and capability.\n\nIn our remaining sessions, we'll review the tools and strategies that have been most helpful for you, and we'll create a personalized \"toolbox\" of skills that you can continue to draw upon after therapy ends. We'll also develop a relapse prevention plan, identifying early warning signs of depression and strategies for coping with potential setbacks.\n\nAdditionally, we can discuss options for ongoing support, such as joining a support group or scheduling periodic \"booster\" sessions to check in and refresh your skills. The goal is to create a plan that helps you feel confident and prepared to continue your journey of growth and healing independently.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this approach to termination? How can we work together to make this transition feel manageable and empowering for you?\n\nPatient: That approach makes a lot of sense, and it helps me feel more at ease about ending therapy. I like the idea of creating a personalized toolbox of skills and having a relapse prevention plan in place. And it's reassuring to know that there are options for ongoing support if I need it.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that approach resonates with you. We'll work collaboratively to create a plan that feels right for you and your unique needs. Remember, the progress you've made is yours to keep, and the skills you've learned will always be with you.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, let's assign some homework to support your continued progress. I encourage you to continue practicing the worry time technique we discussed, setting aside 15-20 minutes each day to focus on your worries. Additionally, experiment with the relaxation techniques we reviewed, finding the variations that work best for you.\n\nFinally, I invite you to reflect on the progress you've made throughout our work together. Take some time to write down the skills and insights you've gained, and consider how you can continue to apply them in your daily life moving forward.\n\nHow does this homework feel for you? Do you have any questions or concerns about the assignments?\n\nPatient: The homework feels manageable and relevant to what we've discussed today. I'm committed to practicing the worry time technique and experimenting with relaxation strategies. And I think reflecting on my progress will be a helpful exercise in solidifying my gains.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. I'm confident that you'll find these homework assignments helpful in continuing your progress. Remember, if any challenges or questions arise as you work on these assignments, we can always discuss them in our next session.\n\nBefore we end today, let's do a quick check-in on your current mood. How are you feeling now, compared to the beginning of our session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling more hopeful and empowered now. Talking through my concerns about ending therapy has helped ease my anxiety, and I feel more confident in my ability to maintain my progress moving forward.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and empowered. That's a testament to the hard work you've put into therapy and the progress you've made.\n\nThank you for your openness and engagement in today's session, Samirah.
