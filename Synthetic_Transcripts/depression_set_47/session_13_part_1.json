  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Samirah, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or significant experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like challenging negative thoughts and using thought records. It's been challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making some progress. I did have that conversation with my cousin about my financial situation and feelings of guilt. It was difficult, but it helped to clear the air a bit.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and finding them helpful, even if it's challenging at times. It's great that you had the conversation with your cousin. How did it go? What was the outcome, and how did it impact your beliefs about your family's expectations and disappointment?\n\nPatient: The conversation with my cousin was tough, but it was also a relief to express my feelings openly. She was more understanding than I expected. She acknowledged the pressure I've been putting on myself and reminded me that our family loves and supports me, regardless of my financial situation. It made me realize that some of my beliefs about their expectations might be distorted.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant insight, Samirah. Recognizing that your beliefs about your family's expectations may be distorted is an important step in challenging those negative thoughts. It's great that your cousin was understanding and supportive. How has this realization affected your mood and overall well-being since the conversation?\n\nPatient: I've been feeling a bit lighter since the conversation. It's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I still struggle with feelings of guilt and worry about disappointing my family, but I'm trying to remind myself of what my cousin said. It's a work in progress, but I feel like I'm moving in the right direction.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling a bit lighter and that the conversation had a positive impact on your mood. Recognizing that it's a work in progress is important. Change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks or struggles along the way. What you're experiencing is a normal part of the process.\n\nLet's set an agenda for today's session. We can continue working on challenging negative beliefs and developing more balanced and compassionate beliefs about yourself. We can also explore any new challenges or progress related to your job search, family relationships, and overall mental health. What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my job search and the negative beliefs I have around that. I've been struggling with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, especially when I don't hear back from potential employers. It's been affecting my motivation to keep applying and putting myself out there.\n\nTherapist: That's a great topic to focus on today, Samirah. Negative beliefs around job search and feelings of inadequacy can be challenging to navigate. Let's explore this further and work on developing more balanced and compassionate beliefs about yourself in the context of your job search. We can also discuss strategies to maintain motivation and self-care during this process.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm hoping to find ways to stay motivated and not get too discouraged when I don't hear back or get rejected.",
