  "transcript": "Patient: Thank you for explaining worry time and thought stopping. I'm looking forward to trying those techniques over the next week.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alexis. Remember, these techniques take practice, so be patient with yourself as you're learning to use them. I have confidence that with continued practice, you'll find them helpful in managing your negative thoughts and worries.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling. What's standing out to you from our discussion today? How are you feeling about the progress we're making?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling encouraged. It's helpful to have specific techniques to use when I'm feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts. I know it will take practice, but I'm committed to working on these skills.\n\nI'm also feeling a bit more hopeful about my progress. It's easy for me to get discouraged when I have setbacks, but I'm starting to see that progress isn't always linear. Even small steps forward are worth celebrating.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alexis. Recognizing and celebrating small steps forward is so important in the therapeutic process. It's normal to have setbacks along the way, but what matters is that you keep showing up for yourself and putting in the effort to create change.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the techniques we've discussed. Set aside a specific time each day for worry time, and use the questions we reviewed to challenge your worries. Practice thought stopping when you notice yourself getting caught up in negative thoughts outside of worry time.\n\nI also want you to continue with your thought records, positive data log, and continuum thinking practice. These techniques build on each other, so the more you practice them, the more natural they'll start to feel.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll make a plan for when I'll do my worry time each day and set reminders for myself to practice thought stopping and the other techniques.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Alexis. Setting reminders for yourself can be really helpful in building new habits.\n\nI also want to encourage you to practice self-compassion this week, especially when it comes to caregiving. When you notice yourself being self-critical, try to pause and offer yourself the same kindness and understanding you would offer a good friend.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best. Self-compassion is still a work in progress for me, but I know it's important.\n\nTherapist: It is a work in progress for all of us, Alexis. The fact that you're committing to practicing it is what matters most.\n\nDo you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you for your support and guidance, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alexis. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, progress takes time, so be patient and compassionate with yourself as you continue this work.\n\nI look forward to hearing about your experiences with the new techniques we discussed today in our next session. In the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out if you need support.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate it. I'll see you next week.\n\nTherapist: I look forward to it, Alexis.
