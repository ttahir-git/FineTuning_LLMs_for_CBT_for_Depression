  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me, Nova. I don't have anything else to add at the moment.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your experience with the thought records and positive data log since our last session. How have you been finding those exercises?\n\nPatient: The thought records have been helpful, but I've struggled to do them consistently. I find it hard to remember to fill them out in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts. The positive data log has been a bit easier for me to maintain, but I still have to remind myself to look for evidence that supports my new beliefs.\n\nTherapist: It's common to face challenges when starting to use these techniques, Alexis. Building new habits takes time and practice. Let's explore what might be getting in the way of doing the thought records consistently. Can you think of any specific situations where you found it difficult to fill out a thought record?\n\nPatient: One situation that comes to mind is when I'm at work and I start feeling overwhelmed by all the tasks I need to complete. In those moments, I feel like I don't have time to stop and fill out a thought record because I need to keep pushing through my work.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Alexis. When we're feeling overwhelmed, it can be challenging to pause and take a step back. One strategy that might be helpful is to set aside a specific time each day for filling out thought records. This could be during your lunch break or at the end of the workday. By creating a dedicated time for this exercise, you may find it easier to make it a consistent part of your routine.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea, Nova. I think setting aside time during my lunch break could work well for me. I'll give that a try.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful! Let's also take a moment to review the positive data log. You mentioned that you've been able to maintain it somewhat, but you still need to remind yourself to look for evidence. Can you share an example of a situation where you were able to find evidence that supported your new beliefs?\n\nPatient: One example is when I asked my sister for help with caregiving responsibilities. Her positive response and willingness to support me was evidence that contradicted my belief that asking for help means I'm a burden.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent example, Alexis! By recognizing and recording evidence that challenges your old beliefs, you're helping to strengthen your new, more balanced beliefs. As you continue to practice this, it will become easier to notice evidence in the moment.\n\nNow, let's discuss your behavioral experiment in more detail. You mentioned that you intentionally left some tasks unfinished at work to test your belief that people would think you're incompetent if you're not perfect. How did that experiment make you feel?\n\nPatient: It was nerve-wracking at first because I was worried about how people would react. But as the day went on and no one seemed to notice or care about the unfinished tasks, I started to feel a sense of relief. It made me realize that my perfectionistic standards might be higher than what others expect of me.\n\nTherapist: That's a valuable insight, Alexis. Behavioral experiments can be powerful tools for challenging long-held beliefs and seeing situations from a different perspective. Recognizing that your perfectionistic standards may be self-imposed is an important step in developing more balanced and realistic expectations for yourself.\n\nLet's explore another perfectionistic belief that we can challenge with a behavioral experiment. Can you think of another belief that has been impacting your life recently?\n\nPatient: One belief that comes to mind is that I need to be available to my mother 24/7, or else I'm not a good caregiver. This belief makes it hard for me to set boundaries and take time for myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant belief to explore, Alexis. Let's design a behavioral experiment to test this belief. What do you think about setting aside a specific time for yourself each day, even if it's just 30 minutes, and observing what happens? During this time, you could engage in self-care activities or simply do something you enjoy.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good experiment. I can try setting aside 30 minutes each evening after dinner to read a book or take a walk, and see how it feels to prioritize that time for myself.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! Remember to pay attention to your thoughts and emotions during the experiment, as well as the actual outcomes. This will help us gather evidence to challenge the belief that you need to be available 24/7 to be a good caregiver.\n\nNow, I'd like to introduce a new technique called \"continuum thinking.\" This technique helps us recognize shades of gray between the extremes of \"perfect\" and \"failure.\" Often, when we have perfectionistic beliefs, we see things in black-and-white terms. Continuum thinking encourages us to find the middle ground and recognize that there are many points between the two extremes.\n\nFor example, let's consider your belief about being available to your mother 24/7. On one end of the continuum, we have \"available 24/7,\" and on the other end, we have \"never available.\" In reality, there are many points along this continuum that represent a more balanced approach to caregiving. Can you think of some examples of what those middle-ground points might look like?\n\nPatient: I suppose a middle-ground point could be setting aside specific times during the day when I'm available to my mother, but also having designated times for myself and other responsibilities. Another point could be sharing caregiving duties with my sister, so I'm not the only one responsible for my mother's care.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples, Alexis! By recognizing these middle-ground points, you can start to challenge the belief that you need to be available 24/7 to be a good caregiver. This can help you find a more balanced and sustainable approach to caregiving that allows for self-care and other important aspects of your life.\n\nAs we continue our work together, we'll practice applying continuum thinking to other perfectionistic beliefs and finding more balanced ways of thinking.\n\nHow are you feeling about the techniques we've discussed so far in today's session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling encouraged and motivated to keep practicing these techniques. The behavioral experiment and continuum thinking make a lot of sense to me, and I can see how they can help me challenge my perfectionistic beliefs. I know it will take time and practice, but I feel like I'm making progress.",
