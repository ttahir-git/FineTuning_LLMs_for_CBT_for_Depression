  "transcript": "Patient: Since our last session, my mood has been up and down. I've had some good days where I feel more motivated and engaged, but I've also had days where I feel overwhelmed and hopeless. It's been a bit of a roller coaster.\n\nTherapist: It's common for moods to fluctuate, especially when you're working on making changes and facing challenges. The fact that you've had some good days is a positive sign, and it shows that the techniques you're practicing are having an impact. On the days when you feel overwhelmed and hopeless, what thoughts tend to go through your mind?\n\nPatient: On those difficult days, I often think that I'm not doing enough, that I should be able to handle everything on my own, and that I'm letting people down. I also worry that I'll never be able to find a good balance between my responsibilities and taking care of myself.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are great examples of some common cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking, should statements, and fortune-telling. Let's explore one of these thoughts a bit further. When you think, \"I should be able to handle everything on my own,\" how does that make you feel?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel guilty, like I'm not good enough or strong enough. It also makes me feel isolated, because I don't want to burden others with my problems.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alexis. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you should be able to handle everything on your own?\n\nPatient: Well, I've always been independent and self-reliant. I've accomplished a lot on my own, and I don't want to be a burden to others.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, and it's great that you have a history of being independent and accomplished. Now, what evidence do you have that goes against the idea that you should be able to handle everything on your own?\n\nPatient: I guess the fact that I've been feeling so overwhelmed and exhausted lately shows that I can't do it all alone. And when I asked my sister for help last week, it felt really good to have her support.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. The fact that you're feeling overwhelmed is a sign that you may be taking on too much, and the positive experience of asking your sister for help shows that it's okay to rely on others sometimes. Based on this evidence, how could you reframe that original thought?\n\nPatient: Instead of thinking, \"I should be able to handle everything on my own,\" I could tell myself, \"It's okay to ask for help when I need it, and relying on others doesn't mean I'm weak or a burden.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Alexis. How does that feel compared to the original thought?\n\nPatient: It feels more compassionate and realistic. It takes some of the pressure off me and makes me feel less guilty about needing support.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful. As you continue to practice challenging these negative thoughts, you'll likely find it easier to manage your emotions and feel more balanced. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I'm starting to see how these techniques can help me change the way I think and feel.\n\nTherapist: You're doing great, Alexis. Let's continue to explore some of the other thoughts you mentioned, such as the idea that you're letting people down or that you'll never find a good balance.",
