  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alexis, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to start by acknowledging my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or hallucinations. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health. How have you been since our last session? Can you share any changes, challenges, or successes you've experienced?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like worry time and thought stopping. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some improvements in my ability to manage negative thoughts. However, I've also been feeling more overwhelmed with my caregiving responsibilities, and I'm struggling to prioritize self-care.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we discussed and noticing some improvements in managing negative thoughts. At the same time, I understand that balancing caregiving responsibilities and self-care can be challenging. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about what's been overwhelming you lately?\n\nPatient: My mother's health has been declining, and I feel like I'm constantly on call. I'm worried about her, but I also feel guilty for not being able to do more. It's hard to find time for myself, and when I do, I feel like I should be doing something for her instead.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel worried about your mother's health and to want to be there for her. At the same time, it's crucial to recognize the importance of self-care in order to be a effective caregiver. Remember the reframed belief we discussed earlier: \"I can be a good child and caregiver while also taking care of myself. Setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care doesn't mean I'm neglecting my mother or being selfish.\" What do you think about this belief now, in light of your current challenges?\n\nPatient: I know you're right, but it's hard to put that belief into practice. I feel like I'm being pulled in so many different directions, and I don't know how to balance it all.\n\nTherapist: It's a common struggle to balance caregiving responsibilities and self-care. Let's work together to find strategies that can help you prioritize both. Before we dive into that, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on today, in addition to discussing the challenges you mentioned?\n\nPatient: I'd like to talk more about how to implement the reframed belief we discussed and find ways to prioritize self-care without feeling guilty. I also want to discuss how to communicate my needs to my family members who may not understand my situation.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. Let's start by exploring how you can implement the reframed belief and prioritize self-care. Then, we can discuss strategies for communicating your needs to your family members. As we work through these topics, we'll also touch on the techniques we've been practicing, like worry time and thought stopping, and see how they can support you in managing your current challenges. How does that sound?",
