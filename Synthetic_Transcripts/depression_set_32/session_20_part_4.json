  "transcript": "Patient: One situation where I've struggled to maintain boundaries is with my mother's caregiving. She often calls me multiple times a day, even for small things, and I feel guilty if I don't answer or help her right away. I know I need to set some limits, but it's hard when I feel responsible for her well-being.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Alexis. Caregiving can be really challenging, especially when we feel a strong sense of responsibility for our loved one's well-being. It's understandable that you feel guilty when you don't answer your mother's calls or help her immediately.\n\nOne way to start setting boundaries is to have an open and honest conversation with your mother about your needs and limitations. You can express your love and care for her while also explaining that you need some time for yourself in order to be the best caregiver you can be.\n\nPatient: I've tried having those conversations with my mother before, but she often gets upset or dismissive. She'll say things like, \"I'm your mother, you should be there for me no matter what.\" It's hard to stand my ground when she says things like that.\n\nTherapist: It's really difficult when our loved ones don't understand or respect our boundaries. In those moments, it can be helpful to remind yourself of your own needs and values, and to practice assertiveness skills.\n\nOne assertiveness technique is the \"broken record\" method, where you calmly and firmly repeat your message, even if the other person is trying to dismiss or argue with you. For example, you could say something like, \"I understand that you need help, and I want to be there for you. At the same time, I also need to take care of myself so that I can be the best caregiver possible. I will call you back within an hour, but I can't always answer the phone right away.\"\n\nPatient: I like the idea of the \"broken record\" method. It's a good way to stay firm without getting dragged into an argument. I'll have to practice that.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Alexis. Assertiveness skills take practice, just like any other skill. It's okay if it feels awkward or uncomfortable at first \u2013 that's totally normal.\n\nAnother helpful technique is to use \"I\" statements to express your needs and feelings, rather than \"you\" statements that can feel blaming or accusatory. For example, instead of saying, \"You're always calling me and expecting me to drop everything,\" you could say, \"I feel overwhelmed when I get multiple calls in a day, and I need some time to recharge so that I can be fully present when we do talk.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can see how \"I\" statements could help prevent my mother from getting defensive. It's just hard to remember to use them in the moment when I'm feeling frustrated or guilty.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alexis. It can be really challenging to remember these skills in the heat of the moment. That's why it's helpful to practice them in advance, when you're feeling more grounded.\n\nOne way to practice is to role-play difficult conversations with a friend or therapist. You can practice using \"I\" statements, the \"broken record\" method, and other assertiveness skills in a low-stakes environment, so that they become more automatic when you need them in real life.\n\nPatient: Role-playing is a good idea. I could practice with my friend Maria \u2013 she's really understanding and supportive.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you have a friend like Maria who can support you in practicing these skills. It can make a big difference to have someone to role-play with and to debrief afterwards.\n\nAs you start to set more boundaries with your mother, it's also important to practice self-compassion. Remember that it's okay to prioritize your own needs, even if it feels uncomfortable or guilt-inducing at first. You're not being selfish \u2013 you're actually taking care of yourself so that you can show up more fully for the people you love.\n\nPatient: Self-compassion is something I definitely need to work on. I have a tendency to beat myself up for not being perfect or not doing enough for others.\n\nTherapist: You're not alone in that, Alexis. Many people struggle with self-compassion, especially when it comes to setting boundaries and prioritizing their own needs.\n\nOne way to practice self-compassion is to imagine what you would say to a close friend who was in your situation. Would you tell them that they were being selfish or not doing enough? Or would you offer them understanding and kindness?\n\nPatient: If a close friend was in my situation, I would definitely offer them understanding and kindness. I would remind them that they can't pour from an empty cup, and that taking care of themselves is just as important as taking care of others.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Alexis. And the same is true for you. You deserve the same understanding and kindness that you would offer to a close friend.\n\nAs we start to wrap up our session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in therapy so far. You've been working really hard to challenge perfectionistic and all-or-nothing thinking patterns, to prioritize self-care, and to set boundaries with your mother. These are all really important steps in managing your depression symptoms and improving your overall well-being.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a challenging journey, but I do feel like I'm making progress. I know I still have a lot of work to do, but I feel more equipped to handle the challenges that come my way.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alexis. I'm really proud of the work you've done so far, and I have confidence in your ability to continue making progress.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to practice the assertiveness skills we discussed, both in role-plays with your friend Maria and in real-life conversations with your mother. Remember to use \"I\" statements, the \"broken record\" method, and self-compassion.\n\nI'd also like you to continue practicing self-care and challenging perfectionistic and all-or-nothing thinking patterns. Remember to refer to your list of self-care activities, and to practice continuum thinking and self-compassion regularly.\n\nPatient: That all sounds good. I'll definitely practice the assertiveness skills and continue working on self-care and challenging my thinking patterns.\n\nTherapist: Great, Alexis. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.\n\nBefore we end, I want to do a quick check-in on your current mood. How are you feeling right now, after our conversation today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also hopeful. It's helpful to have a plan for how to handle the challenges I'm facing, and to know that I have tools and strategies to support me.\n\nTherapist: It's totally normal to feel tired after a therapy session \u2013 we've covered a lot of ground today! I'm glad you're also feeling hopeful and equipped with tools and strategies.\n\nRemember, therapy is a journey, and there will be ups and downs along the way. The important thing is that you keep showing up for yourself, even when it's hard.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and encouragement.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alexis. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nLet's plan to meet again next week, at our usual time. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nPatient: Sounds good. I'll see you next week.\n\nTherapist: I look forward to it, Alexis.
