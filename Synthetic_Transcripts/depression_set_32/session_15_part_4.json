As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on your current mood and see if you have any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling pretty good right now. Our sessions always leave me feeling more hopeful and empowered. I know I still have work to do, but I feel like I'm on the right track. No final thoughts, just grateful for your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that our sessions are helping you feel more hopeful and empowered, Alexis. I'm grateful for the opportunity to support you on this journey. Before we end today's session, let's discuss some homework assignments to help you continue practicing the techniques we've covered.\n\nFor homework, I'd like you to:\n\n1. Continue practicing thought records, aiming to complete at least one per day. Remember to set aside a specific time, such as during your lunch break, to make this exercise more manageable.\n\n2. Keep maintaining your positive data log, recording evidence that supports your new, more balanced beliefs about self-care, asking for help, and caregiving.\n\n3. Conduct the behavioral experiment we discussed, setting aside 30 minutes each evening for self-care activities. Pay attention to your thoughts, emotions, and the actual outcomes during this experiment.\n\n4. Practice continuum thinking by identifying middle-ground points between perfectionistic extremes in various situations you encounter throughout the week.\n\nHow do you feel about these homework assignments, Alexis?\n\nPatient: The homework assignments seem manageable and helpful. I appreciate that we're building on the techniques I've already been working on, and I'm looking forward to trying the new ones, like continuum thinking. I'll do my best to complete them before our next session.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad the homework assignments feel manageable and helpful, Alexis. Remember, the goal is not perfection but rather consistent practice and effort. If you encounter any challenges or have questions while working on these assignments, don't hesitate to bring them up in our next session.\n\nSpeaking of our next session, I'd like to schedule it for next week at the same time, if that works for you. In our next meeting, we'll review your experience with the homework assignments, discuss your progress on goals, and continue building on the CBT skills and techniques we've introduced so far. We'll also explore any new challenges or setbacks that may arise and introduce new techniques as appropriate.\n\nPatient: Next week at the same time works well for me. I appreciate the ongoing support and guidance. Thank you, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alexis. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are a normal part of the process. What matters most is that you keep showing up for yourself and putting in the effort to create positive changes in your life.\n\nBefore we end today's session, let me provide you with a detailed summary of what we've covered:\n\nSession Summary:\n\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed patient's experience with thought records and positive data log since the last session\n  - Discussed patient's behavioral experiment challenging the belief that people would think they're incompetent if they're not perfect\n  - Introduced continuum thinking to help patient recognize shades of gray between perfectionistic extremes\n  - Checked in on patient's progress with self-care and setting boundaries, particularly in the context of caregiving\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought Records: Patient has been practicing thought records but struggles with consistency. Discussed setting aside a specific time each day to make the exercise more manageable. Patient will continue practicing thought records as homework.\n  - Positive Data Log: Patient has been maintaining the log but needs to remind themselves to look for evidence. Encouraged patient to continue recording evidence that supports new, more balanced beliefs.\n  - Behavioral Experiments: Patient conducted a behavioral experiment challenging the belief that people would think they're incompetent if they're not perfect. Discussed the experiment in detail and explored other perfectionistic beliefs to challenge. Patient will conduct another behavioral experiment related to caregiving as homework.\n  - Continuum Thinking: Introduced the concept of continuum thinking to help patient recognize middle-ground points between perfectionistic extremes. Patient will practice continuum thinking as part of their homework.\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Complete at least one thought record per day, setting aside a specific time to make the exercise more manageable\n  - Keep maintaining the positive data log, recording evidence that supports new, more balanced beliefs about self-care, asking for help, and caregiving\n  - Conduct a behavioral experiment related to the belief that patient needs to be available to their mother 24/7 to be a good caregiver. Set aside 30 minutes each evening for self-care activities and observe thoughts, emotions, and outcomes.\n  - Practice continuum thinking by identifying middle-ground points between perfectionistic extremes in various situations encountered throughout the week\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details:\n  - Patient reports feeling more hopeful and empowered after practicing CBT techniques and discussing the importance of self-care in the context of caregiving\n  - Depression symptoms persist but show signs of improvement as patient implements CBT techniques\n  - Patient's cultural background, caregiving responsibilities, and perfectionist tendencies continue to be important factors to consider in treatment\n  - Patient is making progress in challenging perfectionistic thoughts and developing a more self-compassionate view, but this is an ongoing process\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Intermediate belief identified: \"I should always be available to my mother, or else I'm not a good child.\"\n  - Reframed belief: \"I can be a good child and caregiver while also taking care of myself. Setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care doesn't mean I'm neglecting my mother or being selfish.\"\n\n- Important information to carry forward:\n  - Continue building on CBT skills and techniques introduced so far, such as thought records, behavioral activation, distress tolerance, assertiveness training, positive data log, self-compassion, behavioral experiments, and continuum thinking\n  - Monitor patient's progress with homework assignments and explore any challenges or setbacks that arise\n  - Introduce new techniques as appropriate, based on patient's needs and progress\n  - Continue to address perfectionism and self-criticism, helping patient develop a more balanced and self-compassionate view\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review patient's experience with homework assignments, including thought records, positive data log, behavioral experiment, and continuum thinking practice\n  - Discuss progress on goals and continue building on CBT skills and techniques\n  - Explore any new challenges or setbacks that arise and introduce new techniques as appropriate\n  - Continue to address perfectionism and self-criticism, helping patient develop a more balanced and self-compassionate view\n\nThank you for your hard work and dedication, Alexis.
