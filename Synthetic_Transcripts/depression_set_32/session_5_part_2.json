  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your homework from last session. How did you find the process of monitoring and challenging your negative thoughts using the thought records?\n\nPatient: It was challenging at first to remember to stop and write down my thoughts when I was feeling overwhelmed. But as the week went on, I found it a bit easier to recognize those negative thought patterns.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Alexis. It's common for it to feel challenging at first, but with practice, it becomes more natural. Were there any particular thoughts or situations that stood out to you as you were completing the thought records?\n\nPatient: One situation that stood out was when I was trying to work on a project, and I kept getting interrupted by phone calls from my mother's doctors. I found myself thinking, \"I'll never be able to finish this project\" and \"I'm failing at both work and caregiving.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound really distressing. Were you able to challenge them using the evidence for and against, like we discussed?\n\nPatient: I tried. I reminded myself that I've successfully completed projects in the past, even with interruptions. And I know that I'm doing my best to balance work and caregiving, even if it doesn't always feel perfect.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you were able to find some evidence against those negative thoughts. How did that impact your emotions in that moment?\n\nPatient: It helped a bit. I still felt stressed, but I didn't feel as hopeless as I did before challenging the thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's really promising, Alexis. It shows that even small shifts in our thinking can have an impact on our emotions. And with more practice, it's likely to become even more effective.\n\nPatient: I hope so. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment when I'm feeling really overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. That's where the distress tolerance techniques can be really helpful. You mentioned earlier that you found the deep breathing exercises helpful. Can you tell me more about when you used them and how they impacted you?\n\nPatient: I used them a few times when I was feeling really anxious about all the tasks I had to complete. Taking a few minutes to focus on my breathing helped me feel a bit calmer and more able to tackle one task at a time.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Alexis. Deep breathing can be a powerful tool for reducing anxiety and helping us feel more grounded. It's great that you were able to use it in those moments.\n\nPatient: It wasn't always easy to remember to do it, but when I did, it definitely helped.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. It can take practice to make these techniques a habit. One thing that can help is to pair them with regular activities you already do, like taking a few deep breaths every time you wash your hands or before each meal. That way, they become more automatic.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I'll try that this week.\n\nTherapist: Great. And remember, even small moments of practice can make a difference over time. It's not about being perfect, but about building those skills gradually.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: You're doing really well, Alexis. I know it's not easy, but the effort you're putting in is already making a difference. As we continue to work together, we'll keep building on these skills and finding ways to make them work for you.\n\nPatient: Thank you. I'm looking forward to making more progress.",
