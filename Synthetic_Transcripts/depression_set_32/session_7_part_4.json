  "transcript": "Patient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed thinking about putting all of this into practice, but I'm also motivated to make some changes. It's just hard to break old habits and ways of thinking.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed when you're trying to make changes in your life. Remember, you don't have to do everything at once. Start with small steps and be patient with yourself. It's okay if you don't get it right every time \u2013 what matters is that you keep trying.\n\nLet's take a moment to summarize what we've discussed today and create a plan for your homework. We explored your feelings of guilt around self-care and setting boundaries, and we identified some intermediate beliefs that contribute to those feelings. We practiced reframing those beliefs in a more balanced way, and we talked about specific steps you can take to prioritize self-care and set boundaries with your mother and work.\n\nFor your homework this week, I'd like you to:\n1. Continue practicing the distress tolerance techniques we've discussed, like deep breathing and grounding, when you feel overwhelmed.\n2. Complete at least one thought record per day, focusing on challenging negative thoughts related to self-care and setting boundaries.\n3. Schedule a specific time each day for self-care activities, like hiking or attending choir practice, and track your mood before and after these activities.\n4. Have an honest conversation with your mother about your needs and work together to create a schedule that allows for both caregiving and self-care.\n\nHow does that sound to you? Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?\n\nPatient: That sounds manageable. I think the thought records will be helpful for me to practice challenging those negative thoughts. And I'm nervous about the conversation with my mother, but I know it's important. I'll do my best to stick to the plan.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're willing to give it a try, even though it feels challenging. Remember, you can always reach out for support if you need it. We can discuss how the conversation with your mother goes in our next session.\n\nBefore we wrap up, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now, and do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a mix of emotions \u2013 a bit anxious about putting these changes into practice, but also hopeful that things can get better. I'm grateful for your support and guidance in this process. It helps to know that I'm not alone in this.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions as you embark on this journey of change. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. What matters is that you keep showing up for yourself and putting in the effort, even when it's difficult.\n\nI'm here to support you every step of the way, and I'm confident that with time and practice, you'll start to see positive changes in your life. Keep up the great work, Alexis. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Feelings of guilt around self-care and setting boundaries, intermediate beliefs contributing to these feelings, reframing beliefs in a more balanced way, specific steps for prioritizing self-care and setting boundaries.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Distress tolerance techniques (deep breathing, grounding), thought records, behavioral activation (scheduling self-care activities), communication skills (preparing for a conversation with mother about needs and boundaries).\n- Homework assigned: Practice distress tolerance techniques when feeling overwhelmed, complete at least one thought record per day focusing on challenging negative thoughts related to self-care and setting boundaries, schedule a specific time each day for self-care activities and track mood before and after, have an honest conversation with mother about needs and work together to create a schedule that allows for both caregiving and self-care.\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details: Patient is starting to recognize the importance of self-care and setting boundaries, but struggles with feelings of guilt and overwhelm. Patient is motivated to make changes but acknowledges that breaking old habits and thought patterns is difficult.
