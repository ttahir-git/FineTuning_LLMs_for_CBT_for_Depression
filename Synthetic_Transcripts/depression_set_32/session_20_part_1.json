  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alexis, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate or not fully applicable to your situation. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service.\n\nWith that said, I'd like to start by checking in with you. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss today?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me throughout our sessions. Since our last meeting, I've been doing relatively well. I've been practicing the CBT skills we've discussed, particularly when I notice early warning signs or cognitive distortions arising. I've also been working on my relapse prevention plan, which has helped me feel more prepared for potential setbacks.\n\nHowever, I've still been struggling with perfectionistic and all-or-nothing thinking patterns. While I have the tools to challenge these thoughts, it's been difficult to break these long-standing habits. I'd like to focus on this issue today, as well as discuss how I can continue to apply CBT skills to my family dynamics and caregiving responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the CBT skills and working on your relapse prevention plan. It's also important that you've identified perfectionistic and all-or-nothing thinking patterns as ongoing challenges. We can definitely focus on these areas today.\n\nGiven what you've shared, here's a proposed agenda for our session:\n\n1. Explore the challenges you've faced with perfectionistic and all-or-nothing thinking patterns, and discuss strategies to address these issues.\n2. Discuss how to apply CBT skills to your family dynamics and caregiving responsibilities.\n3. Review your progress with the homework assignments from our last session.\n4. Assess your overall emotional state and progress in managing your depression symptoms.\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?\n\nPatient: That agenda sounds perfect, Nova. I think it covers all the main points I'd like to discuss today. I don't have anything else to add at the moment. Let's start with exploring the challenges I've faced with perfectionistic and all-or-nothing thinking patterns.",
