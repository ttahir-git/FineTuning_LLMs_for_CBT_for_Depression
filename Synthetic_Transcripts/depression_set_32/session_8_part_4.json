  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great insights today, Alexis. I want to introduce a technique called the Positive Data Log, which can help you accumulate evidence for your new, more balanced beliefs. The idea is to actively look for and record experiences that support your new beliefs, such as \"It's okay to prioritize my own needs sometimes\" and \"I can be a good child and caregiver while also taking care of myself.\"\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. How does it work?\n\nTherapist: Whenever you have an experience that supports your new beliefs, write it down in your Positive Data Log. For example, if you assertively communicate your needs to your mother and she responds positively, that would be evidence to record. Over time, reviewing your log will help strengthen your new beliefs and make them feel more natural.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's a way to remind myself that my new beliefs are valid and supported by real experiences.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. I'd like you to start a Positive Data Log as part of your homework for next week. In addition, continue practicing the other techniques we've discussed, like thought records and scheduling self-care activities. Remember, the more you practice, the easier it will become to challenge your negative thoughts and prioritize your well-being.\n\nPatient: I'm definitely committed to keeping up with the homework. I know it's important for my progress.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Before we wrap up, how are you feeling about today's session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling encouraged. It's helpful to have these tools and techniques to work with, and I appreciate you helping me find more balanced ways of thinking.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're finding the sessions helpful. Remember, change takes time, and there will be ups and downs along the way. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you continue this journey.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I'll do my best.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alexis. Let's plan to meet again next week at the same time. In the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you again for today's session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Managing guilt around self-care and setting boundaries, communicating needs effectively with family members, challenging distorted thoughts related to caregiving and self-care.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought Records: Reviewed patient's thought records from the past week, focusing on challenging negative thoughts related to self-care and setting boundaries.
