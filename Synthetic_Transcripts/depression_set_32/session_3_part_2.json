  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I'm particularly interested in discussing goal-setting, as I've been struggling to identify clear goals for myself lately.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alexis. Setting clear, achievable goals is a crucial part of the CBT process. When we talk about goals in CBT, we're looking for things that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound - or SMART goals. For example, instead of saying \"I want to feel better,\" a SMART goal might be \"I want to engage in at least 30 minutes of physical activity three times a week for the next month.\" Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. I can see how having a specific goal like that would be much more helpful than just saying \"I want to feel better.\"\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And as we work on setting goals together, we'll want to make sure they align with the overall conceptualization of your depression and the factors that are maintaining it. For example, given your role as a caregiver for your mother, we might want to set a goal related to finding ways to balance those responsibilities with self-care. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: That's a great idea. I've been struggling a lot with finding that balance, and I can see how setting a specific goal around it could be really helpful.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that resonates with you. Why don't we take a few minutes now to brainstorm some potential goals related to that theme? Remember, we're looking for things that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.\n\nPatient: Okay, let me think. One goal could be to set aside 30 minutes each day for an activity that I enjoy, like singing or hiking, even if it means asking someone else to help with caregiving duties during that time.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic goal, Alexis! It's specific, measurable, achievable, relevant to your situation, and time-bound. And it incorporates both self-care and finding balance with your caregiving responsibilities. How confident do you feel about your ability to achieve that goal?\n\nPatient: I feel pretty confident, actually. It might be challenging at first to ask for help, but I know it's important for my mental health.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Asking for help can be difficult, especially when you're used to being the one caring for others. But it's so important to prioritize your own well-being too. As we continue with our sessions, we'll work on building skills to help you achieve this goal and others like it. One technique we might use is called thought recording, where you practice identifying and challenging negative thoughts that might be getting in the way of your goals. Would you be willing to try that out today?\n\nPatient: Yes, I'm definitely willing to give it a try. I know I have a lot of negative thoughts that hold me back, so learning how to challenge them could be really helpful.",
