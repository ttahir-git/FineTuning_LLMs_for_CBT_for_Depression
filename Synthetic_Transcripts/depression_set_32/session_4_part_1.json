  "transcript": "Therapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling positive about our plan, Alexis. Before we dive into today's session, I want to acknowledge some limitations of our interaction. As an AI, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about the limitations. I understand. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the goals we set, but it's been challenging. I've been feeling more overwhelmed with caregiving responsibilities, and I haven't been able to prioritize self-care as much as I'd like.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Alexis. It's common to face challenges when working on new goals, especially when dealing with multiple stressors. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about what's been overwhelming you lately?\n\nPatient: Well, my mother's health has been declining, and I feel like I'm constantly on call. I'm worried about her, but I also feel guilty for not being able to do more. It's hard to find time for myself when I'm always putting her needs first.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and guilty. Caregiving can be emotionally and physically draining, and it's easy to neglect your own needs in the process. I want to reassure you that it's okay to prioritize self-care, even when you're caring for others. In fact, taking care of yourself can actually help you be a better caregiver in the long run.\n\nPatient: I know you're right, but it's hard to shake the guilt. I feel like I should be doing more, and taking time for myself feels selfish.\n\nTherapist: That's a common feeling among caregivers, Alexis. It's important to recognize that self-care isn't selfish; it's necessary for your well-being. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me about a time recently when you felt guilty for taking time for yourself?\n\nPatient: Last week, I had planned to go for a hike, which I know always helps me feel better. But when I was about to leave, my mother called and needed help with something. I ended up canceling my plans and staying with her instead. I felt frustrated and resentful, but also guilty for even considering leaving her.\n\nTherapist: That's a difficult situation, and it's understandable that you felt conflicted. It's important to remember that it's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your needs at times. It doesn't mean you don't care about your mother; it just means you're taking care of yourself, too. Let's work on finding a balance between caregiving and self-care. What do you think about setting an agenda for today's session to help us stay on track?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good idea. I think I'd like to focus on strategies for managing the guilt I feel around self-care and setting boundaries with my mother. I also want to discuss how I can communicate my needs more effectively with my family and friends.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on, Alexis. I'd also like to review your thought records from the past week and see how you've been doing with challenging negative thoughts related to self-care. We can then explore some distress tolerance techniques to help you manage overwhelming emotions when they arise. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds really helpful. I'm looking forward to working on these issues today.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your thought records. Can you share an example of a negative thought you had this week related to self-care and how you challenged it?",
