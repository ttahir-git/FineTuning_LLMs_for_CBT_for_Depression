  "transcript": "Patient: One goal that feels realistic and achievable is to set aside regular time for self-care, even when I'm busy with work and caregiving responsibilities. I often prioritize other people's needs over my own, and I know that's not sustainable in the long run.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Alexis. Setting aside regular time for self-care is essential for managing stress and preventing burnout. It's also a concrete way to practice challenging perfectionistic and all-or-nothing thinking patterns.\n\nWhen you find yourself struggling to prioritize self-care, what thoughts tend to arise? Are there any specific cognitive distortions that you notice?\n\nPatient: When I think about taking time for self-care, I often have thoughts like, \"I should be working on something productive instead\" or \"I don't have time for this.\" I guess that's a form of \"should\" statements and all-or-nothing thinking \u2013 either I'm being productive, or I'm wasting time.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Alexis. Those thoughts are great examples of \"should\" statements and all-or-nothing thinking. When we get stuck in those cognitive distortions, it can be really difficult to prioritize self-care.\n\nOne way to challenge those thoughts is to examine the evidence for and against them. For example, is it really true that self-care is a waste of time? What are the potential benefits of taking breaks and engaging in activities that nourish you?\n\nPatient: When I really think about it, I know that self-care isn't a waste of time. Taking breaks and engaging in activities I enjoy actually helps me be more productive in the long run. It's just hard to remember that in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed by everything on my plate.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alexis. It's common to lose sight of the bigger picture when we're feeling overwhelmed. That's why it can be helpful to create a self-care plan in advance, when you're feeling more grounded.\n\nWhat are some specific self-care activities that you find nourishing? How can you incorporate them into your regular routine in a way that feels manageable?\n\nPatient: Some self-care activities that I find nourishing are going for hikes in nature, singing in my choir, and spending quality time with friends. I could try scheduling these activities into my calendar, just like I would with work tasks or caregiving responsibilities. That way, I'm more likely to follow through with them.\n\nTherapist: Scheduling self-care activities into your calendar is a great strategy, Alexis. It can help you prioritize them and make them feel more like a commitment, rather than something you can easily push aside.\n\nAnother helpful tool is to create a list of self-care activities that you can refer to when you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to prioritize your own needs. That way, you don't have to come up with ideas in the moment \u2013 you can simply choose an activity from your list and take action.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of creating a list of self-care activities. It takes the pressure off of having to decide what to do in the moment. I can include a range of activities, from quick and easy things like taking a short walk or listening to music, to more involved activities like going for a hike or attending a choir rehearsal.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Alexis. Having a range of activities on your list can be really helpful, because different situations call for different types of self-care. Sometimes, you might only have a few minutes to spare, while other times, you might have a whole afternoon or evening.\n\nAs you start to incorporate more self-care into your routine, pay attention to how it impacts your mood and overall well-being. Notice any changes in your energy levels, your ability to focus, and your resilience in the face of stress.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely pay attention to how self-care impacts my mood and well-being. I have a feeling that the more I prioritize it, the more I'll see the benefits in other areas of my life.\n\nTherapist: I have a feeling you're right, Alexis. Prioritizing self-care can have a ripple effect on many different aspects of our lives. As you continue to practice challenging perfectionistic and all-or-nothing thinking patterns, and as you make self-care a more regular part of your routine, I think you'll start to notice some really positive changes.\n\nSpeaking of noticing changes, let's shift gears a bit and talk about how you can apply CBT skills to your family dynamics and caregiving responsibilities. Can you give me an example of a situation where you've struggled to maintain boundaries or prioritize your own needs?",
