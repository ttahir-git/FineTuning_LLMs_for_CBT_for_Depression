  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alexis, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me so far. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like setting aside time for self-care and practicing continuum thinking. It's been challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making progress in finding a more balanced approach to caregiving and taking care of myself.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we've discussed. Balancing caregiving and self-care can be a difficult process, but the fact that you're making progress is a positive sign. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling emotionally since our last session?\n\nPatient: Emotionally, I've had some ups and downs. There are moments when I feel guilty for taking time for myself, but I've been trying to use the worry time and thought stopping techniques to address those thoughts. I've also noticed that when I do engage in self-care activities, I feel a bit more energized and less overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience guilt when starting to prioritize self-care, especially when you're used to putting others' needs before your own. The fact that you're noticing the benefits of self-care, like feeling more energized and less overwhelmed, is a significant insight. It shows that you're starting to see the value in taking care of yourself. Let's make a note to explore these guilty thoughts further today.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'd also like to discuss how I can continue to challenge my all-or-nothing thinking patterns, as I feel that's been a significant barrier for me in finding balance.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely focus on strategies to challenge all-or-nothing thinking today. Before we set our agenda, is there anything else you'd like to prioritize in our session?\n\nPatient: One other thing that's been on my mind is how to maintain the progress I've made once our sessions come to an end. I know we've been working towards termination, and I want to make sure I have a plan in place to continue using these skills independently.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alexis. Developing a plan for maintaining your progress and continuing to use the skills you've learned is crucial as we approach the end of our sessions together. Let's add that to our agenda as well.\n\nSo, for today's session, our agenda includes:\n1. Exploring and addressing guilty thoughts related to self-care\n2. Discussing strategies to challenge all-or-nothing thinking patterns\n3. Developing a plan for maintaining progress and using skills independently after termination\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
