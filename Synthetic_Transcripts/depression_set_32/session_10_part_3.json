  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job working through this thought record, Alexis. I want to introduce another technique that can be helpful in managing stress related to work and other areas of life. It's called \"worry time,\" and it involves setting aside a specific time each day to focus on your worries and concerns. The idea is to contain your worries to this designated time, rather than letting them consume your thoughts throughout the day. During worry time, you can use thought records or other CBT techniques to address your concerns. Outside of worry time, if you notice worries coming up, you can remind yourself that you'll deal with them during your designated worry time. What do you think about trying this technique?\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. I like the idea of having a specific time to focus on my worries, rather than letting them take over my thoughts all day. How long should I set aside for worry time, and when would be a good time to do it?\n\nTherapist: It's generally recommended to set aside about 15-30 minutes for worry time, and to do it at the same time each day. Some people find it helpful to do it in the evening, so they can address their worries before bed and hopefully sleep better. Others prefer to do it earlier in the day, so they can feel more prepared to handle challenges that come up. It's really up to you and what works best for your schedule and preferences. You can experiment with different times and durations to find what feels most helpful for you.\n\nPatient: I think I'll try doing it in the evening, maybe after dinner. That way, I can hopefully clear my mind before bed and sleep better. Is there anything else I should keep in mind when doing worry time?\n\nTherapist: One important thing to remember is to be patient and compassionate with yourself during worry time. It's not about judging or criticizing yourself for having worries, but rather about giving yourself a dedicated space to address them. You can use thought records or other CBT techniques to challenge and reframe your worries, but it's also okay if you don't come to a resolution for every concern. The goal is to contain your worries to this designated time, rather than letting them consume your thoughts throughout the day. It's also important to have a plan for what to do if worries come up outside of worry time. You can remind yourself that you'll deal with them during your designated worry time, and then try to refocus on the present moment or the task at hand. With practice, it will become easier to postpone your worries until your designated worry time.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to be patient with myself and remember that it's okay if I don't resolve every worry during worry time. I'm curious, how does worry time relate to the CBT concepts we've been discussing, like the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors?\n\nTherapist: That's a great question! Worry time relates to the CBT concept of thought suppression, which is the idea that trying to suppress or avoid certain thoughts can actually make them more persistent. By setting aside a specific time to focus on your worries, you're not trying to suppress them entirely, but rather containing them to a designated time. This can help reduce the frequency and intensity of worries throughout the day, which can in turn improve your mood and ability to engage in valued activities. Worry time also involves using CBT techniques like thought records to challenge and reframe worries, which can help shift your perspective and reduce the emotional impact of worries. By practicing worry time regularly, you can start to change your relationship with your worries and develop more adaptive ways of coping with stress.\n\nPatient: That's really helpful to understand how worry time fits into the bigger picture of CBT. I'm excited to try it out and see how it works for me. Is there anything else we should discuss related to managing work stress?\n\nTherapist: One other technique that can be helpful for managing work stress is time management and prioritization. This involves breaking down your work tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, and prioritizing them based on importance and urgency. You can use a planner or calendar to schedule your tasks and create a realistic timeline for completing them. It's also important to build in breaks and self-care activities, like the hiking and singing we discussed earlier. By managing your time effectively and prioritizing self-care, you can reduce feelings of overwhelm and improve your ability to focus on your work tasks. What do you think about trying some time management and prioritization strategies?\n\nPatient: I definitely think that could be helpful for me. I often feel like I have so much to do and not enough time to do it, so breaking things down into smaller steps and prioritizing them could make it feel more manageable. I like the idea of using a planner or calendar to schedule my tasks and build in breaks and self-care activities. I think that could help me feel more in control of my time and less overwhelmed by everything I have to do.",
