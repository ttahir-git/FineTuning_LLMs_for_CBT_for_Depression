  "transcript": "Patient: I'm starting to see how my thoughts and behaviors are connected, but I'm still not sure what kinds of goals I should be setting for myself in therapy. Can you give me some examples of what other people work on in CBT?\n\nTherapist: Sure, I'd be happy to. In CBT, goals are typically specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. For example, someone with social anxiety might set a goal of initiating a conversation with a stranger once a week. Or someone with depression might set a goal of engaging in a pleasant activity, like taking a walk or calling a friend, for at least 30 minutes a day.\n\nPatient: Those examples make sense. I guess for me, a goal could be something like reaching out to a friend once a week to talk about how I'm feeling, instead of keeping everything bottled up inside.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal! It's specific, measurable, and relevant to the issues you're working on. And it's a great way to start challenging some of those negative thoughts about being a burden to others.\n\nPatient: Yeah, it's definitely going to be a challenge for me. But I can see how it would be helpful in the long run.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And as we continue to work together, we can adjust and refine your goals as needed. The important thing is that you're taking active steps towards change, even if they're small at first.\n\nPatient: I'm willing to give it a try. It's just hard to imagine ever feeling differently than I do now.\n\nTherapist: I understand. Depression can make it feel like things will never change. But the reality is that change is possible, and you're already taking the first steps by being here and engaging in this process.\n\nPatient: I guess you're right. It's just hard to keep that perspective sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's why it's so important to have support and accountability, both in therapy and outside of it. Speaking of which, I want to introduce the idea of homework in CBT.\n\nPatient: Homework? Like, assignments I have to do between sessions?\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Homework is a crucial part of CBT because it allows you to practice the skills we're working on in therapy in your everyday life. It might be something like tracking your thoughts and moods, or practicing a specific behavioral goal, like the one we just discussed.\n\nPatient: I'm not going to lie, the idea of homework doesn't sound very appealing. I'm already so busy with work and taking care of my mom.\n\nTherapist: I completely understand. The last thing I want is for therapy to feel like a burden or an added stressor in your life. That's why we'll work together to come up with homework assignments that feel manageable and relevant to your goals.\n\nPatient: Okay, that makes me feel a little better about it. I just don't want to feel like I'm failing if I don't do the homework perfectly.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. Homework is not about being perfect or checking boxes. It's about practicing and learning, even if that means making mistakes or having setbacks along the way. And if you're ever feeling overwhelmed or unsure about an assignment, we can always adjust it or come up with a different plan.\n\nPatient: That's good to know. I guess I'm willing to give it a try, even if I'm a little nervous about it.\n\nTherapist: That's all I can ask for. And remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. We're a team in this process.\n\nPatient: Thanks, that means a lot to me. I'm not used to having this kind of support.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad I can be here for you. And as we continue to work together, I hope you'll start to see that you deserve support and understanding, both from others and from yourself.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just a very different way of thinking for me.\n\nTherapist: I know it is. And that's why we'll take it slow and work at a pace that feels comfortable for you. There's no rush or timeline for this process. The important thing is that you're showing up and doing the work, even when it's hard.\n\nPatient: I'm definitely finding it hard, but I'm trying my best. I want to feel better and I know that means making some changes.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right. And the fact that you're here and engaging in this process, even when it's difficult, is a huge testament to your strength and resilience. I have no doubt that you can make these changes, one step at a time.",
