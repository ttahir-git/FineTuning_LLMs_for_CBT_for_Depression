  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you addressing my feelings of guilt around self-care and setting boundaries. It's something I really struggle with, and I know it's holding me back from making more progress.\n\nTherapist: You're right, addressing these feelings of guilt is crucial for your progress. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come up when you try to prioritize self-care or set boundaries with your mother or work?\n\nPatient: Well, I often think that I should be doing more for my mother, and that taking time for myself is selfish. I feel like I'm not being a good child if I'm not constantly available to her. And with work, I worry that if I don't put in long hours, I'll lose clients or fall behind on projects.\n\nTherapist: Those are understandable concerns, and they're common among caregivers and high-achievers. Let's look at these thoughts more closely. When you say you \"should\" be doing more for your mother, what do you think that means about you as a person if you don't?\n\nPatient: I guess it makes me feel like I'm not living up to my responsibilities, or that I'm being neglectful. It's like I'm not fulfilling my duty as a child.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. This idea of not living up to responsibilities or being neglectful points to some deeply held beliefs about what it means to be a good child or caregiver. In CBT, we call these types of beliefs \"intermediate beliefs\" or \"rules.\" They often take the form of \"should\" statements or \"if-then\" statements. For example, \"I should always be available to my mother, or else I'm not a good child.\" Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that definitely hits home. I've always felt like I need to put others' needs before my own, especially when it comes to family.\n\nTherapist: That's a common belief, and it can be helpful in some situations. But when taken to an extreme, it can lead to feelings of guilt, burnout, and neglect of your own needs. Let's try to reframe this belief in a more balanced way. What would be a healthier or more flexible version of this belief?\n\nPatient: I suppose a healthier version would be something like, \"I can be a good child and caregiver while also taking care of myself. Setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care doesn't mean I'm neglecting my mother or being selfish.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative belief! It acknowledges the importance of being a good child and caregiver while also recognizing the value of self-care and boundaries. Now, let's think about how you can start putting this new belief into practice. What are some small steps you can take to prioritize self-care and set boundaries, without feeling guilty?\n\nPatient: I could start by setting aside a specific time each day for self-care activities, like going for a hike or attending my choir practice. And maybe I could have an honest conversation with my mother about my needs and see if we can come up with a schedule that works for both of us.",
