  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alexis, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few limitations as your AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate or not fully applicable to your situation. Additionally, as an AI, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a crisis or needing immediate support, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our interactions are text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and feelings openly through your messages.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminders, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. I understand the limitations and I'm here to work on my mental health within the scope of what you can provide.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad we have that understanding, Alexis. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been feeling a bit more stable. I've been trying to practice the CBT skills we've discussed, like thought records and continuum thinking. It's not always easy, but I do notice a difference when I put in the effort. I had a bit of a rough patch earlier this week when my mother had a particularly bad day, but I tried to use some of the coping strategies from my toolbox.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been applying the CBT skills and noticing some positive changes. Dealing with rough patches is a normal part of the process, and it's encouraging that you were able to turn to your coping strategies during that challenging time. Can you share a bit more about how you used your toolbox in that situation?\n\nPatient: When I started feeling overwhelmed and guilty for not being able to do more for my mother, I pulled out one of the coping cards we created. It reminded me that I'm doing my best and that it's okay to prioritize self-care. I also tried to challenge some of the all-or-nothing thoughts that were creeping in, like \"I'm a bad child if I can't fix everything for my mother.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example of how you can use your CBT toolbox to manage challenging situations. Recognizing and challenging those all-or-nothing thoughts is a crucial skill. I'm curious, how did your emotions and overall state shift after engaging with your coping card and challenging those thoughts?\n\nPatient: It definitely helped to shift my perspective. I still felt sad and concerned for my mother, but the intensity of the guilt and self-criticism lessened. I was able to remind myself that I'm doing the best I can, and that it's okay to take breaks and focus on my own well-being too.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant insight, Alexis. Shifting from a place of intense guilt and self-criticism to a more balanced and self-compassionate perspective is a key part of managing depression. It's not about eliminating difficult emotions altogether, but rather learning to navigate them in a healthier way. I'm really proud of the progress you've made in this area.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a journey, but I do feel like I'm starting to internalize some of these concepts. I know I still have work to do, but it's encouraging to see some changes.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Progress isn't always linear, but every step counts. Speaking of next steps, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. We can review your experience with the homework assignments, discuss any challenges or successes you encountered while applying CBT skills, and continue to explore how you can use these tools to navigate anticipated stressors. Are there any specific topics or concerns you'd like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on how to maintain my progress after our sessions end. I know we've talked about creating a wellness action plan, but I'm still a bit nervous about managing on my own. I'd also like to discuss how to handle any potential pushback or lack of understanding from my family regarding my need for self-care and boundaries.",
