  "transcript": "Therapist: It's great to hear that you're finding the goal-setting process helpful, Alexis. Before we wrap up for today, I want to make sure we're on the same page about our plan going forward. We've set two main goals for you to work on between now and our next session:\n\n1. Set aside 30 minutes each day for an activity you enjoy, even if it means asking for help with caregiving duties.\n2. Practice asking for help from others at least twice in the next week.\n\nIn addition to working on those goals, I'd also like you to continue practicing the thought recording technique we discussed today. Try to fill out a thought record once a day, focusing on any negative thoughts you have about taking time for yourself or asking for help. We can review your thought records together in our next session and see how it's going.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. I'll do my best to work on those goals and the thought records.\n\nTherapist: I'm confident you can do it, Alexis. And remember, the goal isn't to be perfect, but to practice and learn. If you have any questions or concerns between now and our next session, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I'm looking forward to seeing how this goes.\n\nTherapist: Me too. Before we end, let me summarize what we covered today:\n\nSession Summary:\n- Reviewed the patient's homework from the previous session and discussed their experience with thought monitoring\n- Finalized the conceptualization of the patient's depression, focusing on the role of caregiving stress and difficulty with self-care\n- Introduced the concept of SMART goals and worked with the patient to set two specific goals related to self-care and asking for help\n- Taught the patient the thought recording technique and practiced challenging negative thoughts related to self-care\n- Assigned homework for the patient to work on their two goals and practice thought recording once a day between sessions\n- The patient expressed some apprehension about asking for help but seemed motivated to work on their goals\n- The patient's depression symptoms continue to be a challenge, but they are showing good insight and engagement in the therapy process\n- The patient's cultural and religious background and their role as a caregiver for their mother continue to be important factors to consider in treatment\n- In the next session, we will review the patient's homework, discuss their progress on their goals, and continue to build on the CBT skills and techniques introduced so far, with a focus on challenging negative thoughts and setting behavioral goals\n\nPatient: Thank you for the summary. It's helpful to have it all laid out like that. I'm feeling good about our plan.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alexis. I'm feeling good about it too. I'll see you at our next session. Remember, if anything comes up between now and then, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!",
