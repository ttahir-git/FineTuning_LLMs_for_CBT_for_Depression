  "transcript": "Therapist: It's great to see you again, Alexis. I'm glad the summary from our last session was helpful. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few things about our work together. As an AI, I have some limitations - for example, I can't access any information about you beyond what you share with me in our sessions. I also might occasionally generate something inaccurate, so please let me know if that happens. And while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations. If you ever feel you're in danger of harming yourself, it's crucial to reach out for emergency help. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I can't pick up on non-verbal cues, so I'll be checking in with you regularly to make sure I'm understanding you correctly. Please let me know if any of that doesn't make sense or if you have any questions.\n\nPatient: That all makes sense, thank you for explaining. I appreciate you being upfront about what you can and can't do. I'm looking forward to continuing our work together.\n\nTherapist: I'm looking forward to it as well. To start off, let's set an agenda for our session today. I'd like to review the homework from last time, finalize our conceptualization of your depression, and start setting some specific goals for our work together. How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to make sure we cover today?",
