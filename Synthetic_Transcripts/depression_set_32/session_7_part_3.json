  "transcript": "Therapist: Those sound like great steps to start putting your new belief into practice. Let's break it down a bit further. When you say you'll set aside a specific time each day for self-care activities, what might that look like? Can you give me an example of how you could plan that into your day?\n\nPatient: I could block off an hour in the morning before I start working, and use that time to go for a hike or do some yoga. I usually feel more energized and focused after exercising, so it might actually help me be more productive during the day.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea! Scheduling self-care activities into your day, just like you would with any other important commitment, can help you prioritize them and make them a regular part of your routine. And you're right, exercise can have a positive impact on your mood and energy levels, which can translate into other areas of your life.\n\nNow, let's talk about having that honest conversation with your mother. What do you think you might say to her about your needs and setting boundaries?\n\nPatient: I guess I could start by expressing how much I love her and how important it is for me to be there for her. But I also need to be honest about my own needs and limitations. Maybe I could say something like, \"I want to make sure I'm taking care of myself so that I can be the best caregiver possible for you. That means I might need to take breaks sometimes or ask for help when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful way to approach the conversation. By starting with your love and commitment to your mother, you're setting a positive tone and reassuring her of your intentions. Then, by expressing your own needs and limitations in a clear and honest way, you're setting a boundary that allows you to prioritize self-care without feeling guilty.\n\nRemember, setting boundaries is not about rejecting or abandoning your mother. It's about finding a balance that allows you to show up as your best self, both for her and for yourself. It might take some practice and adjustment, but having open and honest communication is a great starting point.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I've been so focused on trying to do everything myself that I didn't realize how much it was impacting my own well-being. I'm starting to see that taking care of myself isn't selfish \u2013 it's actually necessary if I want to be able to show up for the people I love.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! That's a crucial insight, Alexis. When we prioritize self-care and set healthy boundaries, we're actually investing in our ability to be there for others in a sustainable way. It's like the oxygen mask analogy \u2013 you know how on an airplane, they always tell you to put on your own oxygen mask before assisting others? That's because you can't help anyone else if you're not taking care of yourself first.\n\nAs we continue to work on challenging your negative thoughts and beliefs around self-care and setting boundaries, I encourage you to keep practicing the techniques we've discussed, like thought records and behavioral activation. These tools can help you build awareness of your thought patterns and develop more balanced and compassionate ways of thinking.\n\nPatient: I will definitely keep practicing. It's not always easy, but I'm starting to see how these techniques can make a difference in how I feel and how I approach my relationships and responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that, Alexis. Remember, change takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself. Celebrate the small victories along the way, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.",
