  "transcript": "Patient: I've always been the type of person who likes to be in control and handle things on my own. It's hard for me to ask for help, even when I know I need it.\n\nTherapist: It's common for many people to struggle with asking for help, especially when they're used to being independent and self-reliant. Can you tell me more about your experiences with reaching out for support in the past?\n\nPatient: Well, I've never really talked to anyone about my mental health before. I've always thought that I should be able to handle my problems on my own. But lately, it's been getting harder to manage everything.\n\nTherapist: It takes a lot of strength to recognize when we need support and to take steps to get it. You mentioned earlier that you have a small group of friends within your cultural community. How do you feel about reaching out to them for support?\n\nPatient: I love my friends, but I don't want to burden them with my problems. They have their own lives and struggles, and I don't want to add to that.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to worry about burdening others, but it's also important to remember that friends often want to support each other during difficult times. Have you ever had a friend come to you for support? How did that feel?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I've been there for my friends when they needed me. It felt good to be able to help them and to know that they trusted me enough to share their struggles.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alexis. When we're able to support our friends, it can strengthen our bond and create a sense of trust. It's possible that your friends feel the same way about being there for you. What do you think about trying to open up to one or two trusted friends about what you've been going through?\n\nPatient: I guess I could try talking to my friend Maria. She's always been supportive, and I know she cares about me.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great first step. Remember, you don't have to share everything all at once. You can start by sharing a little bit and see how it feels. It's also okay to let your friends know what kind of support you need, whether it's just listening or helping with specific tasks.\n\nPatient: I'll think about it. It's still scary to be vulnerable like that, but I know I need to do something different.\n\nTherapist: It's normal to feel scared when trying something new, especially when it involves being vulnerable. We can work on building your comfort with vulnerability and asserting your needs in our sessions. I'm here to support you through this process.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate that. I'm just not sure where to start.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. We can start by exploring your thoughts and feelings around vulnerability and assertiveness. Can you tell me more about what scares you about being vulnerable with others?\n\nPatient: I think I'm afraid of being judged or rejected. I've always tried to be strong and independent, and I don't want people to see me as weak or needy.\n\nTherapist: It's a common fear to worry about being judged or rejected when we show vulnerability. However, vulnerability is not a sign of weakness. It actually takes a lot of strength and courage to be open and honest about our struggles. It's also important to remember that the people who care about you will likely want to support you, not judge you.\n\nPatient: I know that logically, but it's hard to believe it emotionally.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alexis. Our thoughts and feelings don't always align, and that's okay. We can work on bridging that gap in therapy. One way to start is by challenging some of the negative beliefs you have about vulnerability and assertiveness. For example, can you think of a time when you were vulnerable with someone and it had a positive outcome?\n\nPatient: I guess when I came out as non-binary to my family, it was scary, but some of my family members were really supportive. That felt good.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example! Even though it was scary, you took a risk and were vulnerable, and it led to a positive experience with some of your family members. We can build on that experience and work on applying it to other areas of your life, like reaching out for support with your mental health.",
