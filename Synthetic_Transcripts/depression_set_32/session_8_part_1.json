  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alexis, it's great to see you again for session 8. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like scheduling self-care activities and practicing distress tolerance when I feel overwhelmed. It's been challenging, but I've noticed small improvements in my mood. However, I still struggle with feelings of guilt when I prioritize myself over caregiving responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we've discussed, and it's encouraging that you've noticed some improvements in your mood. It's understandable that feelings of guilt still arise when you prioritize self-care. Changing long-standing thought patterns and beliefs takes time and practice. Let's explore this further today. Before we do, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing the guilt I feel around self-care and setting boundaries. I also want to discuss how I can communicate my needs more effectively with my mother and other family members. And maybe we could review some of the thought records I've been working on since our last session.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Alexis. We can start by reviewing your thought records and discussing any challenges you've faced while completing them. Then, we can explore the guilt you experience around self-care and setting boundaries, and work on reframing those thoughts. Finally, we'll discuss strategies for communicating your needs effectively with your mother and other family members. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds perfect, Nova. I'm ready to get started.",
