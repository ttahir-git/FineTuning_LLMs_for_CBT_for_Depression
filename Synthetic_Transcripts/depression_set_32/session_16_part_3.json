  "transcript": "Therapist: You've been doing a great job practicing the techniques we've discussed, Alexis. I want to introduce another technique that can be helpful in managing depressive symptoms and challenging negative thoughts. It's called \"worry time.\"\n\nPatient: Worry time? What's that?\n\nTherapist: Worry time is a technique where you set aside a specific time each day to focus on your worries and concerns. During this designated time, you allow yourself to think about the things that are bothering you, but outside of that time, you try to postpone those thoughts.\n\nThe idea is that by containing your worries to a specific time, you can reduce the amount of time you spend ruminating on negative thoughts throughout the day. It can also help you feel more in control of your thoughts and emotions.\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. How do I go about setting up a worry time?\n\nTherapist: First, choose a specific time each day when you'll have your worry time. It should be a time when you're not likely to be interrupted and when you can dedicate about 15-20 minutes to the exercise. It's best to avoid scheduling it too close to bedtime, as you don't want to stir up anxious thoughts right before sleep.\n\nDuring your worry time, write down all the worries and concerns that come to mind. Try to be as specific as possible about each worry. After you've written them down, go through each one and ask yourself:\n\n1. Is this worry based on facts or feelings?\n2. What's the evidence for and against this worry?\n3. What would I say to a friend who had this worry?\n4. Is there a more balanced way to view this situation?\n\nBy questioning your worries in this way, you can start to challenge the negative thoughts and develop a more balanced perspective.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of having a dedicated time to work through my worries, rather than letting them take over my whole day.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Worry time can be a powerful tool in managing depressive symptoms and reducing rumination. I'd like you to try implementing this technique over the next week. Choose a specific time each day for your worry time, and use the questions we discussed to challenge your worries.\n\nIn addition to worry time, I want to introduce another technique called \"thought stopping.\" This can be helpful when you find yourself getting caught up in negative thoughts outside of your designated worry time.\n\nPatient: Thought stopping? How does that work?\n\nTherapist: Thought stopping is a technique where you actively interrupt negative thoughts by saying \"stop\" to yourself, either out loud or in your head. You can also pair this with a physical action, like snapping a rubber band on your wrist, to help break the cycle of negative thinking.\n\nAfter you've interrupted the thought, try to replace it with a more balanced or positive thought. You can use the techniques we've discussed, like continuum thinking or looking for evidence against the negative thought, to come up with an alternative.\n\nPatient: I can see how that could be helpful. Sometimes I get so caught up in negative thoughts that it's hard to break out of that cycle.\n\nTherapist: Thought stopping can be a useful tool in those moments. It takes practice, but over time, it can help you gain more control over your thoughts and reduce the impact of negative thinking patterns.\n\nI'd like you to try using thought stopping over the next week, in addition to implementing worry time. We can discuss your experience with these techniques in our next session.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll give them a try. It's helpful to have some concrete strategies to use when I'm feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: You're doing great, Alexis. Remember, these techniques take practice, so be patient with yourself as you're learning to use them. The more you practice, the more natural they'll start to feel.\n\nI want to check in on how you're feeling about our work together so far. What's been most helpful for you? Are there any areas where you feel stuck or would like to focus more?\n\nPatient: I feel like I'm making progress, slowly but surely. The thought records and behavioral experiments have been really helpful in challenging my negative beliefs. I'm starting to see how my thoughts influence my emotions and behaviors, and how I can shift those patterns.\n\nI do still struggle with self-criticism and perfectionism, especially when it comes to caregiving. Even though I know logically that I'm doing the best I can, I still feel guilty sometimes for not doing more.\n\nTherapist: It's common for perfectionism and self-criticism to be deeply ingrained patterns, so it takes time and practice to shift those beliefs. We can continue to focus on those areas in our work together.\n\nOne technique that can be helpful in addressing perfectionism is to practice self-compassion. This means treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a good friend who was struggling.\n\nWhen you notice yourself being self-critical, try to pause and ask yourself, \"What would I say to a friend in this situation?\" Chances are, you would offer them understanding and support, rather than criticism.\n\nYou can also try using self-compassionate phrases, like \"I'm doing the best I can,\" or \"It's okay to make mistakes sometimes.\" Over time, practicing self-compassion can help to soften the voice of the inner critic.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I would never speak to a friend the way I sometimes speak to myself. I'll try to practice being more self-compassionate, especially when it comes to caregiving.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Alexis. We can continue to explore self-compassion in our work together, and find ways to integrate it into your daily life.\n\nI also want to acknowledge the progress you've made so far. You've been consistently practicing the techniques we've discussed, and you're starting to see shifts in your thoughts and beliefs. That's a big accomplishment, and it takes a lot of courage and hard work.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It helps to hear that. Sometimes I get so focused on how far I still have to go that I forget to acknowledge how far I've come.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alexis. Celebrating your progress, even the small steps, is an important part of the therapeutic process. Every time you challenge a negative thought or practice a new technique, you're taking a step towards a more balanced and fulfilling life.\n\nAs we continue our work together, we'll keep building on the skills and insights you've gained so far. Remember, therapy is a process, and there will be ups and downs along the way. The important thing is that you keep showing up for yourself and putting in the effort to create change.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I'm grateful for your support and guidance through this process. It's not easy, but I know it's worth it.",
