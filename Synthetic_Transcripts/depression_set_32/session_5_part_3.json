  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's dive a bit deeper into the thoughts and beliefs that contribute to your feelings of guilt around self-care. Can you think of a specific situation in the past week where you noticed those feelings coming up?\n\nPatient: Yes, when I was at the cultural festival, I kept thinking about how I should be working or spending time with my mother instead of enjoying myself.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's explore that further. What was going through your mind in that moment? What specific thoughts were you having?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I'm being selfish by taking this time for myself when there are so many other things I should be doing.\" And, \"My mother needs me, and I'm letting her down by being here.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound really heavy and guilt-inducing. Let's look at them a bit more objectively. What would you say to a close friend who expressed similar thoughts to you?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that they deserve to take time for themselves and that it's okay to enjoy activities outside of work and caregiving.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alexis. It's often easier to show compassion and understanding to others than to ourselves. What do you think might be the impact of continuing to prioritize others' needs over your own in the long run?\n\nPatient: I guess I would probably end up feeling more burned out and resentful over time. It's not sustainable to always put myself last.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. While it's admirable to care for others, it's equally important to care for yourself. Neglecting your own needs can actually make it harder to be there for others in the way you want to be.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. But it's just so hard to shake that guilt sometimes.\n\nTherapist: I understand. Guilt is a powerful emotion, and it can be challenging to shift those long-standing beliefs. That's why we'll continue to practice challenging those thoughts and finding more balanced perspectives.\n\nPatient: I'm willing to keep trying. It's just hard to do it in the moment when the guilt feels so strong.\n\nTherapist: That's where the distress tolerance techniques can be really helpful. When you notice those intense feelings of guilt coming up, that can be a cue to pause and use a technique like deep breathing or grounding to help you feel more centered before trying to challenge the thoughts.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can try that. I'll use the deep breathing when I start feeling guilty and then try to challenge the thoughts once I feel a bit calmer.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Alexis. Remember, it's not about getting rid of the guilt completely, but about finding ways to manage it so that it doesn't control your actions or prevent you from taking care of yourself.\n\nPatient: I'll keep that in mind. It's just hard to break those old habits and beliefs.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. It takes practice and patience. But every time you challenge those thoughts and choose to prioritize your own needs, even in small ways, you're taking a step towards a more balanced and sustainable way of living.\n\nPatient: Thank you for your encouragement and support. I know it's not going to be easy, but I'm committed to working on this.\n\nTherapist: You're doing an amazing job, Alexis. Remember to give yourself credit for the progress you've already made and the effort you're putting in. It's not about being perfect, but about making small changes over time that add up to a big difference in your overall well-being.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that perspective. It's easy to get caught up in feeling like I'm not doing enough, but I know I'm taking steps in the right direction.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And we'll continue to work together to build on those steps and find strategies that work for you. Speaking of strategies, let's talk a bit about managing your workload and caregiving responsibilities. Can you tell me more about what's been challenging in that area?",
