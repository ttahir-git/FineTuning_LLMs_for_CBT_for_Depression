  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I'm ready to dive in.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your progress with the Pomodoro Technique and boundary setting. How has it been going with implementing these strategies since our last session?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to use the Pomodoro Technique when I'm working on projects. It's been helpful for breaking tasks down into smaller, more manageable chunks. I find that I'm less overwhelmed when I focus on one thing at a time. But I still struggle with getting started sometimes, and I often underestimate how long things will take.\n\nTherapist: It's good to hear that the Pomodoro Technique has been helpful in making tasks feel more manageable. It's also common to encounter challenges with getting started and estimating time. What do you think might be contributing to those difficulties?\n\nPatient: I think part of it is my perfectionism. I get caught up in wanting everything to be just right, so I procrastinate on starting. And then when I do start, I realize it's taking longer than I thought because I'm being such a perfectionist.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. Perfectionism can definitely contribute to procrastination and difficulty with time management. We can explore some strategies for managing perfectionism a bit later in our session. For now, let's focus on the progress you've made with setting boundaries. How has that been going?\n\nPatient: Setting boundaries has been more challenging for me. I did try to set a boundary with my sister last week. She wanted me to come over and help her with some home repairs, but I had already planned to work on a project for myself that day. I told her I couldn't do it, but I felt really guilty about it afterwards.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel guilty when setting boundaries, especially if you're not used to doing it. But it's also important to prioritize your own needs and commitments. What was the outcome of setting that boundary with your sister?\n\nPatient: She was disappointed, but she said she understood. And I was able to get my project done, which felt good. But I still felt like I was letting her down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how setting boundaries can be challenging but also beneficial. It's okay for your sister to feel disappointed, and it's okay for you to feel guilty. Those feelings don't mean that setting the boundary was wrong. It sounds like it allowed you to prioritize your own commitments and get something important done. As we continue to work on boundary setting, it will hopefully start to feel more comfortable.",
