  "transcript": "Patient: I've been thinking about what you said earlier, about how taking breaks and setting boundaries is an act of self-care. It's just hard to put into practice when I'm in the moment and feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Emilio. It can be challenging to remember and apply these concepts when we're feeling distressed. One strategy that can help is creating coping cards. These are small, portable reminders of the skills and insights you've gained in therapy. You can write down adaptive thoughts, new core beliefs, or even just a few key words that remind you of the work we've done together. Then, when you're feeling overwhelmed, you can pull out a coping card and use it to ground yourself and remember what you've learned. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's like having a little piece of therapy with me wherever I go. I could definitely use that when I'm in the middle of a stressful situation at work.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Coping cards can be a really effective way to bring the skills from therapy into your daily life. Why don't we create one together now? Think back to the thought record we just did about the email from your client. What would be a helpful reminder to have on a coping card related to that situation?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"Thoughts are not facts. Look for evidence before jumping to conclusions.\" That could help me remember to pause and examine my thoughts before getting caught up in anxiety and self-doubt.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent coping card statement, Emilio. It directly challenges the cognitive distortion of jumping to conclusions, which we've identified as a pattern for you. Writing that down and keeping it with you can help you break that pattern and approach situations more objectively. Do you want to create a few more coping cards for other challenging situations?\n\nPatient: Definitely. I could use one for when I'm feeling guilty about taking breaks. Maybe something like, \"Breaks are not lazy. They're necessary for my well-being and productivity.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great one! It directly counters the belief that taking breaks is lazy or unproductive. Having that reminder can help you prioritize self-care even when your initial thoughts are telling you otherwise. Let's do one more. What's another situation where you could use a coping card?\n\nPatient: I often feel overwhelmed when I look at my to-do list and see how much I have to get done. A coping card for that situation could be something like, \"Focus on one task at a time. Break it down into smaller steps.\"\n\nTherapist: I really like that one, Emilio. It speaks to the importance of breaking out of that overwhelmed feeling by focusing on the present moment and taking things one step at a time. That can help you feel more in control and less anxious about all you have to do. These coping cards are a great tool for you to use going forward. Remember, you can always add to them or create new ones as you encounter different challenges. The key is to have them easily accessible so you can use them in the moment when you need them most.\n\nPatient: I appreciate you helping me create these coping cards, Nova. I feel like they'll be really helpful for me in those moments when I'm struggling to apply what I've learned in therapy.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Emilio. I'm glad you find them helpful. Remember, the goal of therapy is for you to eventually become your own therapist. That means taking the skills and insights you've gained here and applying them independently in your daily life. The coping cards are one tool to help you do that. As we continue in therapy, we'll keep adding to your toolbox of skills and strategies for managing your depression and anxiety. It's all about giving you the resources you need to support yourself, even when we're not in session together.",
