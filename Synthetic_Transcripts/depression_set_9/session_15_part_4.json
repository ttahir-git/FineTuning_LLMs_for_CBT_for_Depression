  "transcript": "Patient: I feel like I'm starting to understand how my thoughts and beliefs are connected to my feelings and behaviors. It's still hard to catch those negative thoughts in the moment, but I'm going to keep practicing.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Emilio. Remember, it takes time and practice to build new habits. Be patient with yourself and celebrate each small victory along the way. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance. It means a lot to have someone in my corner.\n\nTherapist: Before we wrap up today's session, let's discuss some homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought records, focusing on catching those negative thoughts and reframing them. Try to do at least one thought record per day.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can do that. It's helpful to have a structured way to challenge my thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Great. I also want you to practice setting boundaries, like we discussed earlier. Try to set at least one boundary this week, whether it's with your sister, a colleague, or even yourself. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and take care of yourself.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I'll try to be more assertive and set some boundaries, even if it feels uncomfortable at first.\n\nTherapist: It might feel uncomfortable at first, but it will get easier with practice. Remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate each small victory along the way.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best. Thank you for everything today, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Emilio. I'm proud of the progress you're making. Remember, change takes time, but you're on the right track. Let's plan to meet again next week at the same time. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you need any support.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I will. Have a great week.\n\nTherapist: You too, Emilio. Take care.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed thought records and practiced reframing negative thoughts related to work stress and procrastination\n  - Explored strategies for managing time and energy, including breaking tasks down into smaller steps and using the Pomodoro Technique\n  - Practiced setting boundaries and being assertive, particularly in relationships with family and friends\n  - Checked in on patient's emotional state and progress throughout the session\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought Records (continued from previous sessions)\n  - Pomodoro Technique (introduced)\n  - Boundary setting (continued from previous sessions)\n  - Worry time and thought stopping (introduced)\n  - Homework review and assignment (continued from previous sessions)\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Practice thought records daily, focusing on catching negative thoughts and reframing them\n  - Set at least one boundary this week, whether with family, friends, or self\n  - Continue practicing the Pomodoro Technique to manage time and energy\n  - Schedule worry time each day to contain and challenge negative thoughts\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details:\n  - Patient reported feeling overwhelmed and hopeless at the beginning of the session, with difficulty managing work stress and setting boundaries\n  - Through the use of thought records, Pomodoro Technique, and boundary setting, patient reported feeling more hopeful and empowered\n  - Patient continues to struggle with negative thoughts related to self-doubt and perfectionism, but is making progress in reframing these thoughts\n  - Depression symptoms include feelings of overwhelm, anxiety, and hopelessness, but patient reported some improvement in these symptoms by the end of the session\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Negative core belief: \"I am incompetent and unworthy.\"\n  - Alternative core belief: \"I am competent and worthy, even when I struggle.\"\n  - Intermediate beliefs: \"If I'm not perfect, people will reject me.\" \"I have to be available all the time or people will think I don't care.\" \"If I set boundaries, I'm a bad person.\"\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review homework, including thought records, boundary setting, and Pomodoro Technique\n  - Continue practicing thought records and reframing negative thoughts\n  - Explore any new challenges or successes related to managing time and energy and setting boundaries\n  - Introduce additional cognitive restructuring techniques as needed",
