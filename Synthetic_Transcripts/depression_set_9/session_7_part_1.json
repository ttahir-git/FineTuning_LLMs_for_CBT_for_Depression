  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 7. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week. I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, but I've been feeling really overwhelmed and struggling to find the motivation to engage in activities.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it can be difficult to find motivation when you're feeling overwhelmed. Let's explore that a bit more. Can you tell me about a specific situation this week where you felt particularly overwhelmed?\n\nPatient: Well, I had a big deadline at work, and I just couldn't focus. I kept thinking about how I'm not good enough and how I'm going to disappoint everyone. I ended up procrastinating and avoiding the project altogether.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a tough situation. I appreciate you sharing that with me. It seems like those negative thoughts about yourself and your abilities were really impacting your ability to focus and engage in your work. Let's add exploring those thoughts and how they influence your behavior to our agenda for today. What else would you like to prioritize in our session?\n\nPatient: I think I'd also like to talk more about the behavioral activation we discussed last time. I'm still struggling to engage in activities, even though I know they might help improve my mood.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss behavioral activation further and explore any barriers that might be getting in the way. So, it looks like our agenda for today includes:\n\n1. Exploring the negative thoughts that arose during the work situation and how they impacted your behavior\n2. Discussing behavioral activation and any barriers to engaging in activities\n3. Reviewing the homework from last session and your experiences with the techniques we've practiced so far\n\nDoes that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
