  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made incredible progress over the course of our sessions together, Emilio. You've developed a wide range of coping skills and strategies, and you've demonstrated a strong commitment to your mental health. I have full confidence in your ability to continue this work independently, and to reach out for support when needed.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I really appreciate all your help and guidance throughout this process. I feel like I have a much better understanding of my thoughts and emotions, and how they impact my behavior.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Emilio. You've done an excellent job of applying the CBT concepts we've discussed, and I can see how much progress you've made in challenging negative thoughts and developing healthier coping strategies. As we wrap up our work together, I want to emphasize the importance of continuing to practice these skills regularly, even when you're feeling good.\n\nPatient: I definitely plan to keep using the tools I've learned. I know it's an ongoing process, and there will be ups and downs, but I feel more equipped to handle them now.\n\nTherapist: That's a great perspective, Emilio. Remember, having a relapse prevention plan doesn't mean you'll never struggle with depression again. It's normal to have ups and downs, and there might be times when you need additional support. The goal is to have a clear roadmap for how to manage those challenges when they arise.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I know it won't always be easy, but I feel like I have more tools to handle it now.\n\nTherapist: You've made incredible progress over the course of our sessions together, Emilio.
