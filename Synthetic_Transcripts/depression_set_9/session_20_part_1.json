  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say, as I can't directly observe non-verbal cues. I also want to remind you that if you ever experience thoughts of self-harm or suicide, it's crucial to seek immediate help from a qualified professional or emergency service, as I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being transparent about your capabilities. I feel comfortable continuing our work together.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful, I'm glad we have that understanding. Now, let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have you noticed any changes in your mood or overall well-being?\n\nPatient: I've been doing alright. I've had some ups and downs, but overall, I feel like I'm making progress. I've been trying to use the coping cards when I feel overwhelmed, and I think they've been helpful.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Emilio. Can you share an example of a situation where you used a coping card and how it helped you?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I was feeling really stressed about a work deadline. I started having thoughts like, \"I'm going to fail,\" and \"I'm not good enough.\" But then I pulled out my coping card that said, \"I am capable and competent, even when I'm not perfect.\" It helped me take a step back and reframe my thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example of using a coping card to challenge negative thoughts and remind yourself of your new, adaptive core beliefs. I'm proud of you for putting these skills into practice. Now, let's take a look at the agenda for today's session. We have a few important topics to cover, as this is our last scheduled appointment. First, I'd like to review your homework and discuss your observations of the CBT triangle. We'll also explore the role of perfectionism in your life and how it relates to your core beliefs. Finally, we'll spend some time reflecting on your progress and creating a plan for maintaining your gains after our sessions end. Does this sound good to you, or is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm a bit nervous about ending our sessions, but I feel like I've learned a lot and I'm ready to try applying these skills on my own.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel nervous about ending therapy. We'll definitely spend time discussing your concerns and creating a solid plan to support you moving forward. Let's start by reviewing your homework. How did you find the process of using thought records and observing the connections between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors?\n\nPatient: It was challenging at first, but I'm starting to see the patterns more clearly. I noticed that when I have negative thoughts, like \"I'm not good enough,\" it leads to feelings of sadness and anxiety, and then I tend to isolate myself or procrastinate on important tasks.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. You're recognizing the connections between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, which is a key part of CBT. By understanding these patterns, you can start to interrupt them and make changes. Let's look at an example from your thought record and practice challenging some of those negative thoughts together.",
