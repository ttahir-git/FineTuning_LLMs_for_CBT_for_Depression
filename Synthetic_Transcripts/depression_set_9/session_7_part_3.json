  "transcript": "Therapist: You're right, asking for help can only improve your situation. It shows that you value your work and want to ensure you're doing a good job. When we avoid asking for help, we can end up feeling more isolated and overwhelmed. Reaching out to Sarah could be a great opportunity to practice challenging those negative thoughts about being incompetent. What do you think about using a thought record to explore this further?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess we could do that. I'm just not sure what to say.\n\nTherapist: That's okay. Let's break it down together. What's the situation or trigger here?\n\nPatient: Well, I need to ask Sarah for feedback on the design specifications for the project.\n\nTherapist: Great. And what emotions are coming up for you around this situation?\n\nPatient: I feel anxious, I guess. And a little embarrassed that I need help.\n\nTherapist: I understand. Those are valid emotions. How intense would you say they are on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: Probably around 75 for anxiety and 50 for embarrassment.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's note that. Now, what automatic thoughts are going through your mind about asking Sarah for help?\n\nPatient: I think I'm worried that she'll judge me or think I'm not capable of doing my job.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common concern. Many people worry about being judged when they ask for help. Let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that Sarah will judge you?\n\nPatient: I guess I don't really have any concrete evidence. It's more just a feeling.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Feelings can be powerful, but they're not always based on facts. What about evidence against the thought that Sarah will judge you?\n\nPatient: Well, she's always been pretty supportive in the past. And she's asked me for help before too.\n\nTherapist: That's really important to consider. So, based on the evidence, how could we reframe or come up with an alternative thought?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"It's okay to ask for help. Sarah has been supportive in the past and asking for feedback shows that I care about doing a good job.\"\n\nTherapist: I think that's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges your concerns but also takes into account the evidence that contradicts your initial worry. How do you feel now about asking Sarah for help, on that same 0-100 scale?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm still a little nervous, but maybe more like 40 now instead of 75.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic progress, Emilio. You've just demonstrated how powerful it can be to examine our thoughts and consider alternative perspectives. And that reduction in anxiety could make it easier to take that step and reach out to Sarah. How do you feel about giving it a try this week?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think I can do that. I'll try to remember this alternative thought if I start feeling anxious about it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. And remember, you can always come back to this thought record if you need a reminder of the evidence against your initial worries. I'm really proud of the work you did here today, Emilio. You're making great progress in recognizing and challenging negative thoughts.",
