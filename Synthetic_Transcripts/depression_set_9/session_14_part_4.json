  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great progress in identifying strategies for managing your time and energy. Before we wrap up, I want to check in on how you're feeling now. How would you rate your emotions compared to the beginning of our session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better. More hopeful, I guess. I still feel overwhelmed, but it feels more manageable now that we've broken it down.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. It's normal to still feel some overwhelm, but it's good that you're feeling more hopeful and like things are more manageable. Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I just need to keep reminding myself of that.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And that's where homework comes in. I'd like to assign some homework for you to practice the skills we've discussed today. First, I'd like you to continue practicing the thought records, aiming to do at least one per day. You can use the same format we used today, and remember to focus on finding evidence against your negative thoughts and coming up with alternative thoughts.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can do that.\n\nTherapist: Great. Second, I'd like you to practice using the Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize your tasks each day. You can make a list of tasks in the morning and categorize them, and then schedule time for the urgent and important tasks first. Remember to also make time for the important but not urgent tasks, like self-care and connecting with others.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to do that each morning.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. And finally, I'd like you to practice setting boundaries around the tasks that are neither urgent nor important, like scrolling through social media. You can set a time limit for yourself, or find alternative activities to do when you're feeling overwhelmed, like going for a walk or listening to music.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll work on that too.\n\nTherapist: Great. Remember, the goal is progress, not perfection. It's okay if you don't do everything perfectly, or if you have days where it's harder to use these skills. The important thing is that you keep trying and keep taking steps forward.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder. I'll do my best.\n\nTherapist: I know you will. And we'll keep working on these skills together in our sessions. Speaking of which, let's schedule our next session. How does next week at the same time work for you?\n\nPatient: That works for me.\n\nTherapist: Great. In our next session, we'll check in on how the homework went and continue working on managing your time and energy. We'll also keep practicing the thought records and exploring any other challenges that come up.\n\nPatient: Sounds good. Thank you for today.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. I'm here to support you. Remember, you're making progress, and you have the skills to keep moving forward. Take care until next time.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed thought records and practiced reframing negative thoughts related to work stress\n  - Explored strategies for managing time and energy, including prioritizing tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix, scheduling self-care and social connection, and setting boundaries around unimportant tasks\n  - Checked in on patient's emotional state and progress throughout the session\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought Records (continued from previous sessions)\n  - Eisenhower Matrix (introduced)\n  - Scheduling and setting reminders for tasks (introduced)\n  - Boundary setting (introduced)\n  - Homework review and assignment (continued from previous sessions)\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Practice thought records daily, focusing on finding evidence against negative thoughts and generating alternative thoughts\n  - Use the Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize tasks each morning, scheduling time for urgent and important tasks first, as well as important but not urgent tasks like self-care and social connection\n  - Set boundaries around tasks that are neither urgent nor important, such as setting time limits for social media and finding alternative activities when feeling overwhelmed\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details:\n  - Patient reported feeling overwhelmed and hopeless at the beginning of the session, with difficulty managing work stress and prioritizing self-care\n  - Through the use of thought records and the Eisenhower Matrix, patient reported feeling more hopeful and like tasks were more manageable\n  - Patient continues to struggle with negative thoughts related to self-doubt and perfectionism, but is making progress in reframing these thoughts\n  - Depression symptoms include feelings of overwhelm, anxiety, and hopelessness, but patient reported some improvement in these symptoms by the end of the session\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Negative core belief: \"I am incompetent and unworthy.\"\n  - Alternative core belief: \"I am competent and worthy, even when I struggle.\"\n  - Intermediate beliefs: \"If I'm not perfect, people will reject me.\" \"I have to be strong and independent all the time.\" \"Taking breaks is a waste of time.\"\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review homework, including thought records, Eisenhower Matrix, and boundary setting\n  - Continue practicing thought records and reframing negative thoughts\n  - Explore any new challenges or successes related to managing time and energy\n  - Introduce additional cognitive restructuring techniques as needed",
