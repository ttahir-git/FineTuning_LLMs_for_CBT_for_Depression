It's great to see you for our 18th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to implement the Pomodoro Technique and boundary setting, but it's still a challenge. I find myself slipping back into old habits, like working for hours without taking breaks or responding to emails late at night. It's frustrating because I know these strategies can help me, but it's hard to stick to them consistently.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Emilio. Changing long-standing habits can be a challenging process, and it's normal to experience setbacks along the way. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and every small step counts. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you found it difficult to maintain your boundaries or use the Pomodoro Technique?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I was working on a project with a tight deadline. I told myself I would stop working at 6 pm and take breaks every 25 minutes using the Pomodoro Technique. But as the deadline approached, I started to feel anxious and worried that I wouldn't finish on time. I ended up working until midnight without taking any breaks. I felt exhausted and frustrated with myself for not sticking to my plan.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Emilio. It's a common experience to let deadlines and anxiety override our self-care plans. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle. What thoughts were going through your mind as you approached the deadline? How did those thoughts influence your feelings and behaviors?\n\nPatient: As the deadline got closer, I kept thinking, \"I'm not working fast enough. I'll never finish on time. My client will be disappointed in me.\" These thoughts made me feel anxious and overwhelmed, which led me to work longer hours and skip my breaks.\n\nTherapist: I see. Those thoughts are closely tied to the perfectionist beliefs we've been working on, such as \"I have to be perfect to be worthy\" and \"If I'm not perfect, people will reject me.\" When we hold ourselves to such high standards, it can lead to anxiety and self-neglect. What do you think would have happened if you had stuck to your original plan of stopping work at 6 pm and taking breaks?\n\nPatient: If I had stuck to my plan, I might not have finished the project by the deadline, but I would have felt less exhausted and overwhelmed. I could have communicated with my client and asked for an extension if needed. I realize that my anxiety was driving me to prioritize the deadline over my well-being.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. It's important to recognize when our thoughts and feelings are leading us to neglect our needs. Let's look at how we can challenge those perfectionist thoughts and find a more balanced approach. What's an alternative thought that could have helped you maintain your boundaries in that situation?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"I'm doing my best, and that's enough. My well-being is more important than meeting a deadline at any cost. If I need to, I can communicate with my client and adjust the timeline.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent! That alternative thought acknowledges your efforts and prioritizes your well-being. It also recognizes that deadlines can be flexible and that open communication with clients is possible. How do you think that thought would have influenced your feelings and behaviors in that situation?\n\nPatient: If I had focused on that alternative thought, I would have felt less anxious and more empowered to stick to my boundaries. I might have still worked hard on the project, but I would have taken breaks and stopped at a reasonable time. I would have felt more in control of my time and energy.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Emilio. By challenging perfectionist thoughts and prioritizing self-care, we can reduce anxiety and maintain healthier boundaries. Remember, this is a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself as you continue to work on it. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I'd like to continue working on challenging perfectionist thoughts and setting boundaries. I also want to discuss how I can be more consistent with the Pomodoro Technique and self-care in general.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a productive agenda, Emilio. We'll focus on challenging perfectionism, setting boundaries, and implementing self-care strategies like the Pomodoro Technique. As we work through these topics, remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Every step counts on this journey.\n\nPatient: I've been thinking about what you said earlier, about challenging perfectionist thoughts and prioritizing self-care. It makes sense, but it's still hard to put into practice. I feel like I've been operating this way for so long that it's become my default setting.\n\nTherapist: You're right, Emilio. Challenging long-held beliefs and patterns can be difficult, and it takes time and practice to create new habits. Remember that every small step counts, and being aware of these patterns is an important first step. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me about a time recently when you noticed yourself falling into perfectionist thinking or neglecting self-care?\n\nPatient: Just last night, actually. I was working on a project, and I kept thinking, \"This isn't good enough. I need to make it perfect.\" I ended up staying up late to work on it, even though I was exhausted. I knew I should take a break, but I felt like I couldn't stop until it was perfect.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Emilio. It's a great opportunity to practice challenging those perfectionist thoughts. Let's break it down using a thought record. What was the situation? What thoughts were going through your mind? How did those thoughts make you feel, and what did you do as a result?\n\nPatient: The situation was working on the project. My thoughts were, \"This isn't good enough. I need to make it perfect.\" Those thoughts made me feel anxious and inadequate, like I wasn't doing a good job. As a result, I kept working late into the night, even though I was exhausted.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that the project wasn't good enough and needed to be perfect?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I don't have any concrete evidence. It's more of a feeling. I want to do a good job, and I feel like if it's not perfect, then it's not good enough.\n\nTherapist: That's a common feeling among perfectionists. Now, let's look at the evidence against those thoughts. Have you received feedback on your work before? What have others said about the quality of your work?\n\nPatient: When I think about it, I have received positive feedback on my work in the past. My clients have been happy with my projects, even if they weren't perfect. I guess perfection isn't necessarily the same as quality.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio! You're right, perfection and quality are not the same thing. In fact, sometimes striving for perfection can actually decrease the quality of our work because we become too focused on details and lose sight of the bigger picture. Let's look at an alternative thought that might be more balanced and helpful.\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"I'm doing my best, and that's enough. My work doesn't have to be perfect to be valuable. I can prioritize my well-being and still produce quality work.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent! That alternative thought acknowledges your efforts and the value of your work, while also prioritizing your well-being. How do you think that thought would have influenced your feelings and behaviors in that situation?\n\nPatient: If I had focused on that alternative thought, I would have felt less anxious and more satisfied with my work. I might have still worked hard on the project, but I would have taken breaks and stopped at a reasonable time. I would have felt more balanced and in control.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Emilio. By challenging perfectionist thoughts and prioritizing self-care, we can reduce anxiety and maintain a healthier perspective. Remember, this is a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself as you continue to work on it.\n\nPatient: I appreciate your encouragement, Nova. It's helpful to break it down like this and see how my thoughts influence my feelings and behaviors. I know it will take time, but I'm committed to working on it.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Emilio. Your commitment to growth is admirable. As you continue to practice these skills, remember to celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Every step counts on this journey.\n\nPatient: I've been thinking about what you said earlier, about challenging perfectionist thoughts and prioritizing self-care.

I'm learning to be more patient with myself and to recognize the small victories along the way.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Emilio. Before we wrap up today's session, let's take a moment to check in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling more hopeful and empowered after our discussion today. I know I still have work to do, but I feel like I have a better understanding of how to challenge my perfectionist thoughts and prioritize self-care.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that, Emilio. Your progress is truly inspiring. Remember, you have the tools and the strength to continue this journey of growth and self-discovery. Let's discuss some homework for the coming week to help you build on the skills we've practiced today.\n\nPatient: That sounds great. What do you have in mind?\n\nTherapist: For this week's homework, I'd like you to continue using thought records to challenge perfectionist thoughts as they arise. Try to set aside a specific time each day to reflect on your thoughts and emotions, and practice generating alternative thoughts that prioritize self-care and balance. Additionally, I encourage you to start implementing the Pomodoro Technique and boundary setting into your daily routine, starting with small, achievable goals like taking a 5-minute break every hour or setting a cutoff time for work emails in the evening. Finally, keep track of your progress and celebrate your successes along the way, no matter how small they may seem.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a solid plan. I'll do my best to stick to it and make note of any challenges or insights that come up.\n\nTherapist: Excellent, Emilio. I have no doubt that you'll make the most of this opportunity for growth and self-care. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and every step counts. Be kind to yourself as you navigate this journey.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Continued work on challenging perfectionism and building self-compassion\n  - Reviewed and practiced thought records\n  - Discussed strategies for making the Pomodoro Technique and boundary setting more consistent and integrated into daily life\n  - Checked in on overall mood and progress with depression symptoms\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (continued from previous sessions)\n  - Pomodoro Technique (continued from previous sessions)\n  - Boundary setting (continued from previous sessions)\n  - Positive data log (continued from previous sessions)\n  - Cognitive restructuring (continued from previous sessions)\n  - Self-compassion breaks (introduced in this session)\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue using thought records, setting aside a specific time each day to reflect on thoughts and emotions\n  - Start implementing the Pomodoro Technique and boundary setting into daily routine, starting with boundaries around email and work hours\n  - Track progress and celebrate successes along the way\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details:\n  - Patient reported feeling encouraged and motivated to continue working on perfectionism and self-compassion\n  - Patient continues to struggle with consistency in using the Pomodoro Technique and boundary setting, but has a plan for building these habits\n  - Depression symptoms include fatigue and feelings of overwhelm, but patient reported some improvement in these symptoms by the end of the session\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Negative core belief: \"I am not good enough and have to be perfect to be worthy.\"\n  - Alternative core belief: \"I am good enough and worthy, even when I'm not perfect.\"\n  - Intermediate beliefs: \"If I'm not perfect, people will reject me.\" \"I have to be available all the time or people will think I don't care.\" \"If I set boundaries, I'm a bad person.\"\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review homework, including thought records, Pomodoro Technique, and boundary setting\n  - Continue exploring the role of perfectionism in patient's life and how it relates to core beliefs\n  - Introduce additional techniques for challenging perfectionism and building self-compassion, such as mindful self-reflection and gratitude practice\n  - Check in on patient's overall mood and progress with depression symptoms\n\n",
