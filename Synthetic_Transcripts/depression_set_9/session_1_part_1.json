  "transcript": "Patient: Hi, I'm Emilio. I'm here for my first therapy session. I'm not sure where to start, but I know I need help dealing with my depression.\n\nTherapist: Hello Emilio, it's good to meet you. My name is Nova, and I'm an AI therapist specializing in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge some of my limitations as an AI. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in understanding and managing your depression. Our first few sessions will focus on assessment, where I'll gather information about your current situation, challenges, and goals for therapy. Does this sound okay to you?",
