  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's take a look at one of the thought records you completed for homework. Can you share an entry that stood out to you or felt particularly challenging?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I had a situation at work where I made a mistake on a project. My initial thoughts were, \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right.\" I felt really down and ended up staying late at work to fix the mistake, even though I was exhausted.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Emilio. I can imagine how difficult that situation must have been. Let's walk through the thought record together. What emotions did you notice in that moment?\n\nPatient: I felt sad, anxious, and frustrated with myself. I also felt embarrassed, like everyone at work must think I'm incompetent.\n\nTherapist: Those are heavy emotions to sit with. What behaviors did you engage in as a result of those thoughts and feelings?\n\nPatient: I isolated myself from my coworkers and stayed late to fix the mistake. I also skipped my lunch break and worked through the evening, even though I was really tired.\n\nTherapist: It's interesting to see how those negative thoughts and feelings led to behaviors that likely weren't helpful in the long run, like skipping meals and overworking yourself. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against those initial thoughts. What evidence did you find that supports the idea that you're a failure and can't do anything right?\n\nPatient: Well, I did make a mistake on the project, and it caused some delays. That's evidence that I messed up.\n\nTherapist: Okay, that's one piece of evidence. What about evidence against those thoughts? Have there been times when you've succeeded at work or received positive feedback?\n\nPatient: When I think about it, I have had a lot of successful projects in the past. And my boss has told me before that she values my work and thinks I'm a strong team member. So I guess that's evidence against the idea that I can't do anything right.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! It's important to consider the full picture, rather than focusing only on the negative aspects. Now, let's look at the alternative thoughts you came up with. What did you write down?\n\nPatient: I wrote, \"Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. One mistake doesn't mean I'm a failure. I'm human, and I'm still learning and growing.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are powerful alternative thoughts, Emilio. How did your emotions and behaviors shift after considering that perspective?\n\nPatient: I started to feel a bit more hopeful and less anxious. I realized that I could learn from the mistake and move forward, rather than beating myself up about it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of using a thought record to challenge negative thoughts and shift your perspective. I'm curious, how might you have behaved differently in that situation if you had access to those alternative thoughts right away?\n\nPatient: I probably would have taken a break to calm down, rather than staying late and skipping meals. I might have even reached out to a coworker for support or guidance, instead of isolating myself.\n\nTherapist: Those are healthy, adaptive behaviors that align with your new core belief, \"I am good enough and worthy, even when I'm not perfect.\" As we've discussed before, our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. By challenging negative thoughts and considering alternative perspectives, we can start to shift our emotions and behaviors in a more positive direction.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's just hard to remember in the moment, when I'm feeling really down on myself.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable. It takes practice to break old patterns and establish new ones. That's why we've been working on building your toolbox of CBT skills, like thought records and coping cards. The more you practice these techniques, the more automatic they'll become.\n\nPatient: I have been trying to use the coping cards, and I think they're helping. But sometimes I still get stuck in negative thought spirals.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Emilio. It's normal to have setbacks and challenges along the way. That's why we're going to spend some time today creating a relapse prevention plan. This will include identifying early warning signs that you might be slipping back into old patterns, as well as strategies for getting back on track.\n\nPatient: That sounds really helpful. I want to make sure I have a solid plan in place for after our sessions end.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. We'll work together to create a comprehensive plan that feels manageable and sustainable for you. Before we dive into that, though, I want to check in on how you're feeling about our sessions coming to an end. It's normal to have mixed emotions about this transition.",
