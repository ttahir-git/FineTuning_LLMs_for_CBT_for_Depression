  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about that. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to implement the Pomodoro Technique and boundary setting, but it's still a challenge. I find myself slipping back into old habits of working long hours without breaks and saying yes to every request, even when I'm already overloaded. It's frustrating because I know these techniques can help me, but it's hard to stick with them consistently.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been attempting to use the Pomodoro Technique and boundary setting, even if it's been challenging. Change takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself. Let's explore what's been getting in the way of consistency. What thoughts or feelings come up when you try to take breaks or set boundaries?\n\nPatient: I think a big part of it is that I feel guilty when I'm not working. I have this belief that I should always be productive, and taking breaks feels like I'm being lazy or not doing enough. And with boundaries, I worry that people will think I'm not a team player or that I don't care about their needs. I know these thoughts aren't necessarily true, but they're hard to shake.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important insights, Emilio. It sounds like some of your core beliefs around productivity and people-pleasing are making it difficult to prioritize your own well-being. Remember, taking breaks and setting boundaries is actually a way of ensuring that you can show up as your best self, both for yourself and others. It's not selfish or lazy; it's an act of self-care. What do you think about that perspective?\n\nPatient: I can see the logic in that, but it's hard to fully believe it. I've been operating under these beliefs for so long that they feel like facts rather than thoughts I can change.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. Our core beliefs can feel very entrenched and difficult to change. But with consistent practice, it is possible to shift them over time. One way to start is by examining the evidence for and against these beliefs. For example, have there been times when taking breaks actually improved your productivity or the quality of your work?\n\nPatient: When I think about it, there have been times when stepping away from work for a bit helped me come back with fresh ideas or a new perspective. And I guess there have been instances where setting boundaries prevented me from overextending myself and allowed me to do better work on the tasks I did take on.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence to support the idea that breaks and boundaries can actually enhance your productivity and performance. As we move forward, I encourage you to keep collecting evidence that challenges your old core beliefs and supports new, more balanced beliefs. Does that feel like a helpful approach?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that could be really helpful. Collecting evidence to challenge my old beliefs and support new ones makes it feel more concrete and achievable.\n\nTherapist: Fantastic. Let's make that a priority for today's session. We can also review your thought records and explore any other challenges that have come up since our last session. Does that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds great, Nova. I think focusing on challenging my core beliefs and reviewing thought records will be really helpful. I can't think of anything else to add to the agenda right now.",
