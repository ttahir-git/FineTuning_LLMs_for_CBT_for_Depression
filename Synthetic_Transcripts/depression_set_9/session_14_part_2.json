  "transcript": "Patient: No, I think that covers the main things I wanted to discuss today. I'm just feeling really overwhelmed and hopeless about everything.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why you're feeling that way, given all that you've shared with me. Let's start by taking a closer look at the thoughts and emotions you've been experiencing around work. You mentioned feeling anxious, stressed, and hopeless when you think about the project you're working on. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts that are contributing to those emotions?\n\nPatient: Well, I keep thinking that I'm not good enough, that I don't have what it takes to succeed in this job. I'm worried that I'm going to fail and let everyone down.\n\nTherapist: Those are some really challenging thoughts. Let's explore them a bit further using a thought record. This is a tool we can use to examine the thoughts that are contributing to your emotions and see if there might be alternative ways of looking at the situation. Are you familiar with thought records from our previous sessions?\n\nPatient: Yes, we've used them before. They were helpful in identifying some of the negative thoughts I was having and coming up with more balanced perspectives.\n\nTherapist: Great, I'm glad to hear that you found them helpful. Let's start by identifying the situation or trigger that led to these thoughts and emotions. Can you briefly describe what happened?\n\nPatient: It started when I realized I was falling behind on this project at work. I got really anxious and started thinking that I was going to fail.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so the situation was falling behind on the project. And the emotions you identified were anxiety, stress, and hopelessness. Let's write those down. Now, let's identify the specific thoughts that are contributing to those emotions. You mentioned thinking \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'm going to fail.\" Are there any other thoughts that are coming up for you?\n\nPatient: I guess I also think that if I fail at this project, it means I'm a failure as a person. Like, I'm not just failing at work, but at life in general.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important thought to identify. Let's write that down as well. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not good enough or that you're going to fail?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm falling behind on this project, and I've struggled with similar projects in the past. I also tend to be really hard on myself and focus on my mistakes rather than my successes.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so that's some evidence that supports those thoughts. Now, let's look at the evidence against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you are good enough and that you're not going to fail?\n\nPatient: I guess I have had some successes at work in the past. And I've gotten positive feedback from colleagues and supervisors before. It's just hard to remember those things when I'm feeling so overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's really common. When we're feeling anxious or depressed, it can be hard to see the evidence that contradicts our negative thoughts. But it's important to try to look at the situation objectively. Let's write down the evidence against the thoughts: you've had successes at work before, and you've received positive feedback from others. Now, let's see if we can come up with an alternative thought that takes into account all the evidence. What do you think would be a more balanced way of looking at the situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be that I'm struggling with this project, but that doesn't mean I'm a failure as a person. I've had successes in the past, and I have the skills and abilities to handle this challenge, even if it's difficult.\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges the challenge you're facing, but also recognizes your strengths and past successes. How does that thought feel compared to the original thoughts?\n\nPatient: It feels a bit more hopeful. Like, maybe I can handle this after all.\n\nTherapist: That's great. Let's write down that alternative thought and rate your emotions again now that we've gone through this process. How intense are the feelings of anxiety, stress, and hopelessness now?\n\nPatient: They're still there, but they're not as intense. Maybe more like a 6 out of 10 instead of a 9.\n\nTherapist: That's progress! It's not always easy to challenge negative thoughts, but it can make a big difference in how we feel. This is a tool you can use anytime you're feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts. With practice, it will start to feel more natural.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely keep working on it. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment when I'm feeling really anxious or down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. It can be hard to remember to use these tools when we're really struggling. One thing that can help is to set aside a specific time each day to practice using thought records. That way, it becomes more of a habit, and it's easier to remember to do it when you need it most. What do you think about trying that this week?\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I can try setting aside 10 minutes each day to practice using thought records.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. You can start with just one thought record per day and gradually increase as it becomes more comfortable. And remember, it's okay if it feels challenging at first. With practice, it will get easier.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's move on to discussing strategies for managing your time and energy. This is another area where you've been struggling, and I think we can come up with some tools to help. What do you think are the biggest challenges for you when it comes to managing your time and energy?",
