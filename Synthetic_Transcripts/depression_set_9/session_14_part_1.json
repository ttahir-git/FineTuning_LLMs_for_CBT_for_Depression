  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week, to be honest. I've been trying to keep up with the relaxation techniques and thought records, but I've been feeling really overwhelmed with work and personal responsibilities. It's been hard to find the time and energy to prioritize self-care.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging it can be to balance everything, especially when you're dealing with depressive symptoms. Let's take a moment to explore what's been going on for you. Can you tell me more about the overwhelming feelings you've been experiencing?\n\nPatient: It just feels like there's so much to do and not enough time to do it. I'm behind on a project at work, and I'm worried about meeting the deadline. And then there's the usual stress of keeping up with household chores and trying to maintain some sort of social life. It's just a lot.\n\nTherapist: That does sound like a lot to manage. Let's break it down a bit. When you think about the project at work, what thoughts come up for you?\n\nPatient: I keep thinking that I'm going to fail, that I'm not good enough to handle this project. And then I start worrying about what my colleagues will think of me if I don't deliver.\n\nTherapist: Those are some really tough thoughts. Let's explore them a bit further. When you have the thought \"I'm going to fail,\" what emotions do you feel?\n\nPatient: I feel anxious, stressed, and hopeless. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of negative thinking, and I can't seem to break out of it.\n\nTherapist: I can see how those thoughts and emotions would be really challenging to deal with. Let's take a moment to set an agenda for our session today. We can definitely spend some time working through the thoughts and feelings you've been having around work. What else would you like to prioritize in our time together today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd also like to talk about how I can better manage my time and energy. I know self-care is important, but I'm struggling to make it a priority.\n\nTherapist: That's a great topic to focus on. We can explore some strategies for managing your time and energy, and how to make self-care a more regular part of your routine. So, it looks like our agenda for today includes:\n\n1. Exploring the thoughts and emotions related to work stress\n2. Discussing strategies for managing time and energy\n3. Identifying ways to prioritize self-care\n\nDoes that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
