  "transcript": "Here is part 3 of 4 for the CBT session transcript with Emilio:\n\nPatient: I've been working on the Positive Data Log you suggested, and I'm starting to see how my negative core belief isn't always accurate. It's helpful to have concrete examples to look back on.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Emilio! Can you share an entry from your Positive Data Log that particularly stood out to you?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I had a meeting with a client who had some concerns about a project I was working on. Normally, I would have panicked and assumed they thought I was incompetent. But I managed to stay calm, listen to their concerns, and provide a solution that they were happy with. It showed me that I am capable of handling challenges at work without it meaning I'm incompetent.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent example of how you were able to challenge your negative core belief in the moment. By staying calm and problem-solving, you gathered evidence that supports your alternative core belief of being competent and worthy. How did it feel to have that experience?\n\nPatient: It felt really good. I was proud of myself for not getting overwhelmed by my negative thoughts. It gave me a boost of confidence.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful! As you continue to gather evidence against your negative core belief, you'll likely start to notice a shift in your overall thinking patterns. It's a process, but each piece of evidence helps to weaken the hold that negative belief has on you.\n\nPatient: I'm starting to see that. It's just hard sometimes when I'm in a situation that triggers those old thought patterns.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. It takes practice to break long-standing thought patterns. One technique we can use to help with that is called \"thought stopping.\" It involves recognizing when you're having a negative thought, pausing, and then actively replacing it with a more balanced thought. For example, if you start to think \"I'm going to fail at this project,\" you could stop that thought and replace it with something like \"I've succeeded at projects before, and I have the skills to handle this one.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of having a go-to phrase to interrupt those negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! It's a way to take control of your thought process and steer it in a more helpful direction. Why don't we practice that now? Can you think of a situation that often triggers negative thoughts for you?\n\nPatient: Well, I often get stuck in negative thought patterns when I'm trying to work on a difficult project, and I feel like I'm not making progress.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's use that scenario. What's a common negative thought that comes up for you in that situation?\n\nPatient: Usually something like \"I'm never going to figure this out. I'm not smart enough for this job.\"\n\nTherapist: Alright, so when you notice yourself having that thought, I want you to visualize a big red stop sign. That's your cue to pause and replace the thought with a more balanced one. What could you say to yourself instead?\n\nPatient: I could say something like \"I've overcome challenges before, and I have the skills to figure this out, even if it takes some time.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great replacement thought! It acknowledges the challenge but reminds you of your capabilities. Let's practice that a few more times.",
