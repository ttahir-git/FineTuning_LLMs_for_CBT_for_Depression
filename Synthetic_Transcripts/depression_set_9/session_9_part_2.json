  "transcript": "Patient: Since our last session, I've been trying to notice when my negative core beliefs come up, especially at work. Last week, I had a moment where I made a small mistake on a project, and my first thought was, \"I'm incompetent, and I don't deserve to be here.\" But then I remembered the evidence we gathered, like the positive feedback I've received from colleagues and clients. I tried to challenge that negative thought by reminding myself of those things.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how you can use the evidence we've gathered to challenge your negative core beliefs in real-time, Emilio. It's not easy to catch those thoughts and reframe them in the moment, so the fact that you were able to do that is a significant step forward. How did you feel after challenging that negative thought?\n\nPatient: I felt a bit better, like I had more perspective on the situation. It didn't completely get rid of the negative feeling, but it helped me to not spiral into a full-blown depressive episode like I might have before.\n\nTherapist: That's an important insight, Emilio. Challenging negative thoughts and beliefs is a skill that takes practice, and it's not always going to completely eliminate the negative feelings right away. But as you continue to practice, it can help to reduce the intensity and duration of those feelings over time. I'm glad to hear that it helped you to avoid spiraling in that moment.\n\nPatient: Yeah, it's definitely a work in progress, but I feel like I'm starting to see how this could help me in the long run.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and the fact that you're already seeing some benefits is a good sign. As we continue to work on this together, you'll likely find it easier to catch and reframe those negative thoughts and beliefs, and it will start to feel more natural and automatic.\n\nPatient: I hope so. It's just hard sometimes, especially when I'm feeling really low.\n\nTherapist: I understand, and that's why we're taking it one step at a time. On the days when you're feeling really low, it can be helpful to focus on self-care and basic coping strategies, like the relaxation and grounding techniques we've discussed. And on the days when you're feeling a bit more resilient, that's when you can practice challenging those negative thoughts and beliefs.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just need to be patient with myself and keep practicing.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, and that's where self-compassion comes in. Recognizing that this is a process and that it's okay to have setbacks or difficult days is an important part of the journey. Let's talk a bit more about self-compassion and how it relates to the perfectionism we discussed earlier. What do you think are some ways you could practice being more compassionate with yourself?\n\nPatient: I think one thing I could do is to try to talk to myself the way I would talk to a friend who was struggling. Like, if a friend made a mistake at work, I wouldn't tell them they were incompetent or didn't deserve to be there. I would probably remind them of their strengths and accomplishments, and tell them that everyone makes mistakes sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how you can practice self-compassion, Emilio. Treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a friend can be a powerful way to counteract the negative self-talk that often comes with perfectionism. Another strategy is to practice mindfulness and non-judgmental awareness of your thoughts and feelings, recognizing that they are just thoughts and feelings, not necessarily facts or truths.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's just hard to remember to do that in the moment, when I'm caught up in the negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's where the mindfulness practice comes in. By regularly practicing mindfulness, even when you're not feeling particularly stressed or overwhelmed, you can start to build up that ability to observe your thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them. It's like building a muscle - the more you practice, the stronger and more automatic it becomes.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just need to keep practicing and be patient with myself.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, and that's something we can continue to work on together. As you practice being more compassionate with yourself and challenging those negative thoughts and beliefs, you'll likely find it easier to cope with the difficult moments and setbacks that are a normal part of life.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance through this process.",
