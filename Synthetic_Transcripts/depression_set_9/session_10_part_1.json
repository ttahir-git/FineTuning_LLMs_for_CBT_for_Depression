  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for our 10th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me so far. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like progressive muscle relaxation and grounding. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some improvement in managing my overwhelming emotions. I also tried to engage in a social activity, but I ended up canceling last minute due to anxiety.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the relaxation and grounding techniques, and that you've noticed some improvement in managing your emotions. It's okay that you weren't able to follow through with the social activity this time. Overcoming anxiety takes practice and small steps. Let's explore what made it challenging for you to attend the social activity and how we can work on making it more manageable in the future. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my negative core belief about being incompetent and unworthy. It's been a recurring theme in my thoughts, and I feel like it's holding me back in many aspects of my life, including social interactions. I'd also like to discuss the outcome of the behavioral experiment we designed last session, about asserting my ideas at work.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan. We can start by discussing the outcome of the behavioral experiment and explore any changes in your thoughts and beliefs related to competence. Then, we can delve deeper into your negative core belief and work on reframing it. We'll also continue practicing cognitive restructuring and introduce additional behavioral experiments if appropriate. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds great. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Let's begin with the behavioral experiment. Can you tell me how it went when you tried to assert your ideas at work?",
