  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the Pomodoro Technique and set boundaries, but it's still a challenge. I did start the positive data log, and that's been helpful in moments when I'm feeling down on myself. I'm still struggling with perfectionism and feeling like I'm not good enough, but I'm trying to work on it.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been making an effort to practice the techniques we've discussed, and it's great that the positive data log has been helpful. It's understandable that perfectionism and feelings of inadequacy are still challenges for you. These beliefs are often deeply ingrained, and it takes time and consistent effort to change them. Let's explore your experiences with the homework assignments a bit more. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you used the Pomodoro Technique or set a boundary?\n\nPatient: Sure. I used the Pomodoro Technique when I was working on a project for a client. I tend to get so absorbed in my work that I lose track of time, and before I know it, I've been working for hours without a break. This time, I set a timer for 25 minutes and took a 5-minute break when it went off. It helped me stay focused and avoid burnout. As for setting boundaries, I had a friend who wanted to come over last minute, but I was exhausted. Normally, I would have just said yes, but this time, I told them I needed to rest and suggested we hang out another time.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of using the Pomodoro Technique to manage your time and energy effectively. It's also wonderful that you were able to set a boundary with your friend. How did it feel to prioritize your own needs in that moment?\n\nPatient: It felt uncomfortable at first, because I'm so used to putting others' needs before my own. But after I said it, I felt a sense of relief. I knew I was doing the right thing for myself, and my friend was understanding about it.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience when we start setting boundaries. It can feel uncomfortable or even selfish at first, but as you experienced, it often leads to a sense of relief and self-care. It's great that your friend was understanding, too. This is a good example of how setting boundaries can actually strengthen relationships rather than harm them. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to continue working on challenging my perfectionism and building self-compassion. I know we've talked about it before, but it's still something I struggle with a lot. I also want to discuss how I can be more consistent with using the techniques we've talked about, like the Pomodoro Technique and boundary setting.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. We can definitely continue our work on perfectionism and self-compassion, and we can also explore ways to make the techniques we've discussed more consistent and integrated into your daily life. Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main things I wanted to discuss today.\n\nTherapist: Alright, so our agenda for today's session includes:\n1. Continuing our work on challenging perfectionism and building self-compassion\n2. Exploring ways to make the Pomodoro Technique and boundary setting more consistent and integrated into your daily life\n3. Checking in on your overall mood and progress with depression symptoms\n\nDoes this sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds great. Let's start with perfectionism and self-compassion.",
