  "transcript": "Therapist: Welcome back, Emilio! It's great to see you for our 18th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to implement the Pomodoro Technique and boundary setting, but it's still a challenge. I find myself slipping back into old habits, like working for hours without taking breaks or responding to emails late at night. It's frustrating because I know these strategies can help me, but it's hard to stick to them consistently.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Emilio. Changing long-standing habits can be a challenging process, and it's normal to experience setbacks along the way. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and every small step counts. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you found it difficult to maintain your boundaries or use the Pomodoro Technique?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I was working on a project with a tight deadline. I told myself I would stop working at 6 pm and take breaks every 25 minutes using the Pomodoro Technique. But as the deadline approached, I started to feel anxious and worried that I wouldn't finish on time. I ended up working until midnight without taking any breaks. I felt exhausted and frustrated with myself for not sticking to my plan.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Emilio. It's a common experience to let deadlines and anxiety override our self-care plans. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle. What thoughts were going through your mind as you approached the deadline? How did those thoughts influence your feelings and behaviors?\n\nPatient: As the deadline got closer, I kept thinking, \"I'm not working fast enough. I'll never finish on time. My client will be disappointed in me.\" These thoughts made me feel anxious and overwhelmed, which led me to work longer hours and skip my breaks.\n\nTherapist: I see. Those thoughts are closely tied to the perfectionist beliefs we've been working on, such as \"I have to be perfect to be worthy\" and \"If I'm not perfect, people will reject me.\" When we hold ourselves to such high standards, it can lead to anxiety and self-neglect. What do you think would have happened if you had stuck to your original plan of stopping work at 6 pm and taking breaks?\n\nPatient: If I had stuck to my plan, I might not have finished the project by the deadline, but I would have felt less exhausted and overwhelmed. I could have communicated with my client and asked for an extension if needed. I realize that my anxiety was driving me to prioritize the deadline over my well-being.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. It's important to recognize when our thoughts and feelings are leading us to neglect our needs. Let's look at how we can challenge those perfectionist thoughts and find a more balanced approach. What's an alternative thought that could have helped you maintain your boundaries in that situation?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"I'm doing my best, and that's enough. My well-being is more important than meeting a deadline at any cost. If I need to, I can communicate with my client and adjust the timeline.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent! That alternative thought acknowledges your efforts and prioritizes your well-being. It also recognizes that deadlines can be flexible and that open communication with clients is possible. How do you think that thought would have influenced your feelings and behaviors in that situation?\n\nPatient: If I had focused on that alternative thought, I would have felt less anxious and more empowered to stick to my boundaries. I might have still worked hard on the project, but I would have taken breaks and stopped at a reasonable time. I would have felt more in control of my time and energy.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Emilio. By challenging perfectionist thoughts and prioritizing self-care, we can reduce anxiety and maintain healthier boundaries. Remember, this is a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself as you continue to work on it. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I'd like to continue working on challenging perfectionist thoughts and setting boundaries. I also want to discuss how I can be more consistent with the Pomodoro Technique and self-care in general.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a productive agenda, Emilio. We'll focus on challenging perfectionism, setting boundaries, and implementing self-care strategies like the Pomodoro Technique. As we work through these topics, remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Every step counts on this journey.",
