  "transcript": "Patient: Thanks for walking me through that thought record, Nova. It's helpful to see how my thoughts are connected to my emotions and how challenging those thoughts can make a difference.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Emilio. I'm glad you found it helpful. Thought records are a powerful tool for identifying and challenging the thoughts that contribute to our emotional experiences. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to catch those thoughts in the moment and reframe them in a more balanced way.\n\nPatient: I definitely want to keep practicing this. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment when I'm feeling really down on myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Emilio. It takes time and repetition to build new habits, especially when we're trying to change long-standing patterns of thinking. One strategy that can be helpful is to set aside a specific time each day to reflect on your thoughts and emotions. This can be a time when you sit down with your thought record and intentionally think back on your day, looking for moments when you noticed strong emotions or self-critical thoughts.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of having a dedicated time to focus on this, instead of trying to do it all the time.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's more manageable to start with a specific time each day, and then gradually work towards doing it more in the moment as you build the skill. Another strategy is to use reminders or cues to prompt you to check in with your thoughts and emotions. This could be something like setting an alarm on your phone, or using a visual reminder like a sticky note on your computer screen.\n\nPatient: I could definitely set an alarm on my phone. That's a good idea.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's talk about how you can use that alarm as a cue to pause and check in with yourself. When the alarm goes off, take a moment to notice any thoughts or emotions that are present. If you notice any self-critical thoughts or strong emotions, that's a good opportunity to pull out your thought record and work through the process we just practiced.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can do that. I'll set an alarm for a time each day when I know I'll have a few minutes to sit down and do this.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Emilio. Remember, the goal is not to get rid of all self-critical thoughts or difficult emotions. That's not realistic or even desirable. The goal is to develop a new relationship with those thoughts and emotions, so that they don't have as much power over you. By practicing this skill regularly, you'll start to notice that you have more choice in how you respond to those thoughts and emotions, rather than feeling controlled by them.\n\nPatient: I like that perspective. It feels more manageable than trying to never have those thoughts or feelings at all.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. It's about changing our relationship with our thoughts and emotions, not getting rid of them entirely. As you continue to practice this skill, you'll likely find that the self-critical thoughts have less of an impact on your mood and behavior over time.",
