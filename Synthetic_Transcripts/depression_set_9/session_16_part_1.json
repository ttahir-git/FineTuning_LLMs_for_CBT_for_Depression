  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for our 16th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like the Pomodoro Technique and setting boundaries. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some improvements in my ability to manage my time and energy. However, I've still been struggling with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we've discussed, and it's encouraging that you've noticed some improvements in managing your time and energy. It's also important that we address the ongoing struggles with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness. Let's make sure to include that in our agenda for today's session. What else would you like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I'd like to discuss how I can better challenge my negative thoughts and continue working on reframing them. I also want to talk about how I can be more consistent with setting boundaries, especially with my family. And maybe we could explore some strategies for managing my perfectionist tendencies, as I feel like they're holding me back.\n\nTherapist: Those are all important topics, and I think they'll be valuable for us to discuss today. Let's create an agenda that includes:\n\n1. Reviewing your progress with the Pomodoro Technique and boundary setting\n2. Exploring strategies for challenging negative thoughts and reframing them\n3. Discussing ways to manage perfectionist tendencies\n4. Developing a plan for consistently setting boundaries with family\n\nHow does that sound to you, Emilio? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today's session?",
