  "transcript": "Therapist: It's common to have fears and doubts about sharing something personal, especially when it feels like it exposes us to judgment or criticism. Let's take a closer look at the thoughts and feelings that are coming up for you around this.\n\nWhat do you imagine others might think or say if they see your painting? And how do you think you would feel if that happened?\n\nPatient: I'm worried that they'll think it's not very good, or that I'm not a real artist. I guess I'm afraid of feeling embarrassed or like I've been exposed as a fraud.\n\nTherapist: Those fears make a lot of sense given your core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" It's a vulnerable thing to share something you've created, especially when you're already struggling with feelings of inadequacy.\n\nOne thing to consider is that our fears about what others might think often say more about our own insecurities than they do about reality. We tend to assume that others will be as critical of us as we are of ourselves, but that's not always the case.\n\nHave you had experiences in the past where you shared something personal and the response was different than what you feared?\n\nPatient: Well, there was one time I showed a friend a poem I had written, and they actually really liked it. They said it was beautiful and that I had a talent for writing. I was surprised because I thought they would think it was stupid.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how our fears don't always match up with reality. It sounds like your friend saw something valuable in your poem, even though you were expecting criticism.\n\nThis is where the concept of cognitive distortions comes in. Cognitive distortions are inaccurate or irrational thought patterns that can contribute to negative emotions. One common distortion is \"mind reading,\" where we assume we know what others are thinking without any real evidence.\n\nIt sounds like you might have been engaging in some mind reading when you assumed your friend would think your poem was stupid. Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see how that's a pattern for me. I often assume the worst about what others are thinking, even though I don't really know for sure.\n\nTherapist: Recognizing that pattern is an important step in being able to challenge it. One way to do that is to look for evidence that contradicts the distorted thought.\n\nIn the case of your painting, what evidence do you have that others might actually appreciate or enjoy it? Have you received positive feedback on your art in the past?\n\nPatient: I have had a few people tell me they like my art. And I did win an award for a painting I submitted to a local art show a few years ago.\n\nTherapist: That's significant evidence that contradicts the thought that others will think your painting isn't good. It sounds like you've had experiences where your art has been recognized and valued by others.\n\nAnother strategy for challenging cognitive distortions is to consider alternative perspectives. How might someone who cares about you and wants to support your artistic pursuits view your painting?\n\nPatient: I guess they would probably be proud of me for putting myself out there and sharing something I created. They might see it as brave or admirable.\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative perspective to consider. Sharing your art can be an act of courage and vulnerability, and those who care about you are likely to recognize and appreciate that.\n\nAs we've been discussing, challenging cognitive distortions takes practice, but it can be a powerful tool in shifting your thoughts and feelings. Would you be willing to try sharing your painting with a trusted friend or family member this week as an experiment? You could even let them know beforehand that it feels vulnerable for you and that you're working on challenging your fears around it.\n\nPatient: I can try. I think I'll start with my friend who I know is supportive of my art. I can tell them what we've been talking about and ask them to give me honest but gentle feedback.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. Starting with someone you trust and who you know is supportive is a smart way to approach it. And communicating your needs and fears around the feedback can help create a safer and more comfortable space for you to share.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't to get a specific reaction or response, but rather to practice challenging the distorted thoughts and beliefs that have been holding you back. Regardless of the feedback you receive, the act of sharing your art is a step towards challenging that core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\"\n\nAs you continue to practice sharing your art and challenging your fears around it, you might start to notice a shift in your thoughts and feelings over time. It's a process, but each small step can make a difference.\n\nI'm really proud of the work you're doing, Priya. Challenging long-held beliefs and fears takes a lot of courage, and you're making great progress. Let's keep exploring this in our next session and see how the experiment goes with sharing your painting.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your support and encouragement. I'm nervous about sharing my painting, but I'm willing to give it a try and see what happens.",
