  "transcript": "Therapist: Sure, let's brainstorm an experiment together. One negative belief we've identified is \"I'm not good enough.\" What's a situation where this belief often comes up for you?\n\nPatient: I often feel like I'm not good enough at work. I struggle to speak up in meetings and share my ideas, because I assume they're not valuable.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's design an experiment to test out that belief. What if, in your next team meeting, you set a goal to share at least one idea or opinion? We can predict what you think will happen, then compare it to what actually happens.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can try that. I predict that people will think my idea is stupid or irrelevant.\n\nTherapist: That's a good prediction to test out. Remember, we're looking for objective evidence here. So after the meeting, you can reflect on people's actual reactions and responses to your idea, rather than assuming what they think.\n\nPatient: Got it. I'll pay attention to how people respond and try not to jump to negative conclusions.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. We can discuss the results in our next session and see how they compare to your prediction. This experiment can provide valuable evidence against the belief that you're not good enough, especially in a work context.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and talk about how we can continue challenging that core belief of \"I'm not good enough\" in other areas of your life. One technique we can use is the Positive Data Log. This involves actively looking for and recording evidence that contradicts your negative core belief.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's easy for me to focus on all the times I feel like I'm not good enough, but I don't often pay attention to evidence that shows I am good enough.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. The Positive Data Log helps us balance out that bias and build up a more realistic, nuanced view of ourselves. For homework this week, I'd like you to start a Positive Data Log. Every day, try to write down at least one piece of evidence that challenges the belief \"I'm not good enough.\" This could be a compliment someone gives you, a task you accomplish, or even a small moment of self-care.\n\nPatient: That sounds doable. I'll give it a try and see what evidence I can collect.\n\nTherapist: Great. Remember, the goal isn't to ignore or dismiss your struggles, but rather to broaden your perspective and recognize your strengths and accomplishments alongside your challenges.\n\nWe've covered a lot today, from reviewing your boundary-setting experience to designing a behavioral experiment and introducing the Positive Data Log. How are you feeling about our work together so far?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling good about it. It's challenging at times, but I can see how these techniques are helping me shift my perspective and build more balanced beliefs.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that. Remember, change is a gradual process, and every small step counts. You're doing great work, Priya.\n\nWe still have some time left in our session today. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or explore further?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. I've been thinking a lot about my relationship with my family and how it ties into my beliefs about myself. Can we explore that a bit more?",
