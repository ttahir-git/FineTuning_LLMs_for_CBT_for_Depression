  "transcript": "Patient: In my culture, family obligations are taken very seriously. There's a strong emphasis on putting family first and being there for each other no matter what. Setting boundaries can be seen as selfish or disrespectful, especially when it comes to elder family members.\n\nTherapist: That's a valuable insight, Priya. It's important for us to consider how these cultural values might be shaping your thoughts and behaviors around boundary-setting. It sounds like there could be a conflict between your cultural expectations and your personal needs for self-care and autonomy.\n\nLet's explore this further. How do you think these cultural values might be reinforcing your core belief of \"I'm not good enough\"?\n\nPatient: I think the expectation to always put family first reinforces the idea that my own needs and desires are less important. If I prioritize my own well-being over family obligations, it can feel like I'm not living up to the cultural ideal of a \"good\" family member.\n\nTherapist: That makes a lot of sense, Priya. It's a common experience for people to feel torn between cultural expectations and personal needs. This conflict can exacerbate feelings of guilt and inadequacy, especially when there's a strong cultural value placed on self-sacrifice and putting others' needs first.\n\nAs we work on challenging your core belief of \"I'm not good enough,\" it will be important to consider how your cultural background might be influencing this belief. We can explore ways to honor your cultural values while also recognizing the importance of self-care and boundary-setting.\n\nOne way to do this might be to reframe the concept of being a \"good\" family member. Instead of equating goodness with self-sacrifice, we could define it as being able to show up for your family in a way that's sustainable and authentic to you. This might mean setting boundaries when necessary so that you can be fully present and engaged when you are with your family.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this reframing, Priya?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of reframing what it means to be a \"good\" family member. It takes some of the pressure off of always having to say yes and puts the focus on the quality of the time and energy I'm able to give. I think it will take some practice to internalize this new perspective, but it feels like a healthier way to approach family obligations.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad this reframing resonates with you, Priya. It's a great first step in aligning your personal needs with your cultural values. As you practice this new way of thinking, it will start to feel more natural and automatic.\n\nAnother strategy we can use to challenge the cultural beliefs that reinforce your core belief is to examine the evidence for and against them. For example, let's take the belief that \"Setting boundaries is selfish and disrespectful.\" What evidence do you have that supports this belief?\n\nPatient: Well, I've seen other family members be judged or gossiped about for setting boundaries or prioritizing their own needs. There's definitely a cultural norm of putting family first, and people who deviate from that norm can face social consequences.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid point, Priya. Social norms and judgments can be powerful reinforcers of cultural beliefs. Now, let's consider the evidence against this belief. Can you think of any examples of people in your culture who have set boundaries in a way that was respectful and well-received?\n\nPatient: It's harder to think of examples, but I know there are some. My cousin recently set a boundary around not attending every family gathering due to her work schedule, and while there was some initial pushback, people eventually understood and respected her decision. It helped that she communicated her needs clearly and calmly, without being defensive or apologetic.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Priya! It shows that setting boundaries can be done in a way that is culturally sensitive and respectful. It also highlights the importance of communication and delivery in how boundaries are received.\n\nAs we gather more examples like this, it can help build a case against the belief that setting boundaries is inherently selfish or disrespectful. We can use these examples to create a new, more balanced belief, such as \"Setting boundaries can be done in a way that honors my cultural values and maintains positive family relationships.\"\n\nWhat do you think about this new belief, Priya?\n\nPatient: I think it's a healthier and more realistic belief to strive for. It acknowledges the cultural context while also leaving room for personal needs and self-care. I know it will take time and practice to fully internalize this new belief, but having concrete examples to draw on will help.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Priya. Challenging long-held cultural beliefs is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. We can continue to gather evidence and examples that support this new belief, and practice reframing situations that trigger the old belief.\n\nAs you work on setting boundaries within your cultural context, remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself. It's okay if it feels uncomfortable or if you face some pushback at first. With time and practice, it will become easier to assert your needs in a way that feels authentic and culturally sensitive.\n\nWhat thoughts or questions do you have about applying this new belief to your own boundary-setting efforts?",
