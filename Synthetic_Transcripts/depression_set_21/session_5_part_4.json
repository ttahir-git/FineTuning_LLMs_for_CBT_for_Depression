  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made, Priya. You've been actively engaging in the techniques we've discussed, and you've shown a willingness to challenge some of the thoughts and beliefs that contribute to your depression. This is a significant step forward, and I encourage you to continue building on this momentum.\n\nBefore we end, I'd like to assign some homework for the coming week. First, continue practicing the behavioral activation activities we discussed, including listening to music and cooking a nice meal for yourself. Aim to do these activities at least a few times during the week, and pay attention to how they impact your mood and energy levels.\n\nSecond, practice deep breathing or another mindfulness technique for a few minutes each day. This can help you stay grounded and manage difficult emotions as they arise.\n\nFinally, work on the goal we set related to your core belief about not being good enough. Aim to finish your painting and share it with a trusted friend or family member. Remember to notice the evidence that emerges from this experience, and be prepared to discuss it in our next session.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about the homework, Priya?\n\nPatient: No, I don't have any questions. The homework feels manageable, and I understand how it relates to the work we're doing in therapy. I'll do my best to complete it and be prepared to discuss my progress next week.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Priya. I'm here to support you and help you work through any challenges that may arise. Remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. Every step you take is a step towards a healthier, more balanced life.\n\nLet's plan to meet again next week at the same time. In the meantime, take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need additional support.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your guidance and encouragement. I'll see you next week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Priya's progress with thought records and behavioral activation since the last session.\n  - Introduced mindfulness techniques, specifically deep breathing, to help manage mood and energy levels.\n  - Explored Priya's core belief of \"I'm not good enough\" and discussed strategies for challenging and modifying this belief, including examining evidence and conducting behavioral experiments.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Continued practice of identifying and reframing cognitive distortions, with a focus on all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, and mind-reading.\n  - Behavioral activation: Reviewed progress on previous goals (walking, reading, reaching out to a friend) and set new goals for the coming week, incorporating an artistic activity.
