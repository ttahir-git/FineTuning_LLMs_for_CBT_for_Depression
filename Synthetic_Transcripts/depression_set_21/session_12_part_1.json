  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our 12th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interactions are text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues.\n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. I'd like to start by checking in with you. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like keeping a Positive Data Log and challenging my negative thoughts. It's been challenging at times, but I think I'm making some progress. I did have a difficult interaction with my sibling that left me feeling pretty down.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on the techniques we discussed, even though it hasn't been easy. I'd like to explore that difficult interaction with your sibling and how it impacted your mood. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for today's session. We can prioritize discussing the interaction with your sibling and how it relates to your core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" We can also review your Positive Data Log and the behavioral experiment you tried. Does that sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?",
