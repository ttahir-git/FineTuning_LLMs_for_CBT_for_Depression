  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our 13th session together. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last meeting. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I'm here to support you, I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a chance I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. And since our communication is text-based, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to working with you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate your commitment to helping me. Since our last session, I've been trying to keep up with the Positive Data Log and thought records. It's still challenging at times, but I'm noticing small shifts in my thinking patterns. I had a tough interaction with my sibling again, but I tried to apply some of the skills we've been working on.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've discussed, even though it's not always easy. Small shifts in thinking patterns are a significant step forward. Would you like to share more about the interaction with your sibling and how you applied the skills?\n\nPatient: Sure. My sibling called me, asking for help with a family matter. I felt that familiar sense of obligation and guilt creeping in. But I took a step back and tried to identify my automatic thoughts. I realized I was jumping to the conclusion that if I didn't help, I was a terrible sibling. I tried to challenge that thought and remind myself that setting boundaries is okay.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of catching your automatic thoughts in the moment and challenging them. Recognizing the guilt and obligation you felt, and then questioning the belief that not helping makes you a terrible sibling, is a big step. How did it feel to set that boundary?\n\nPatient: It was uncomfortable, but also a bit empowering. I still felt guilty afterward, but not as much as I usually would. I'm starting to see how my thoughts and beliefs have been driving my actions and emotions.\n\nTherapist: That discomfort you felt is normal when trying something new, especially when it challenges long-held beliefs. The sense of empowerment you mentioned is a positive sign that you're starting to see the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Let's keep exploring this. For today's agenda, what would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to discuss the boundary-setting further and maybe explore some other situations where I can practice challenging my negative beliefs. I also wanted to talk about my Positive Data Log and some of the evidence I've gathered against my core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a productive plan. We can start by discussing your experience with boundary-setting in more detail and then explore other situations where you can apply the skills we've been working on. After that, we'll review your Positive Data Log and the evidence you've collected against your core belief. How does that sound?",
