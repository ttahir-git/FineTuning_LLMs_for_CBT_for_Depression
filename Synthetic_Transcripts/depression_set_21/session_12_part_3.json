  "transcript": "Here is part 3 of 4 for the CBT session transcript with Priya:\n\nTherapist: You mentioned earlier that you had a difficult interaction with your sibling recently. I'd like to explore that further if you're comfortable. Can you tell me more about what happened and how it made you feel?\n\nPatient: It was during a family gathering. My sibling made a comment about how I'm not really contributing to the family, since I'm not married and don't have kids. It really hurt, because it felt like they were saying I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a very painful experience, especially given your core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" Let's break this down using a thought record. What emotions did you feel in that moment?\n\nPatient: I felt sad, hurt, and angry. I also felt ashamed, like there was something wrong with me.\n\nTherapist: Those are strong emotions. Let's rate their intensity on a scale of 0 to 100. How intense was the sadness?\n\nPatient: I'd say the sadness was around 80.\n\nTherapist: And the hurt?\n\nPatient: Also around 80.\n\nTherapist: What about the anger?\n\nPatient: Maybe a bit lower, around 60.\n\nTherapist: And the shame?\n\nPatient: That was probably the strongest, around 90.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have sadness at 80, hurt at 80, anger at 60, and shame at 90. Now let's identify the automatic thoughts that went through your mind when your sibling made that comment. What were you thinking?\n\nPatient: I thought \"They're right, I'm not contributing enough to the family. I'm letting everyone down. I'm not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are closely tied to your core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" Let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you see that supports the idea that you're not contributing enough to your family?\n\nPatient: Well, it's true that I'm not married and don't have kids, which is what's expected in my culture. And I don't see my family as often as I'd like because of my work schedule.\n\nTherapist: That's valid evidence on one side. Now let's look at the evidence against those thoughts. What are some ways in which you do contribute to your family?\n\nPatient: I suppose I do try to be there for my family when they need me. I help out financially when I can, and I try to be emotionally supportive.\n\nTherapist: Those are important contributions. Let's also consider the fact that there are many ways to contribute to a family beyond marriage and children. Is it possible that your sibling's comment was influenced by cultural expectations, rather than an objective measure of your worth?\n\nPatient: I think that's probably true. In my culture, there's a lot of pressure to follow a certain path in life.\n\nTherapist: So, while there may be some truth to the idea that you're not contributing in the way your culture expects, there's also evidence that you are contributing in other meaningful ways. Given that, how might you reframe your original thought?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like \"I may not be following the traditional path, but I'm still contributing to my family in my own way.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe. It acknowledges the cultural expectations, but also recognizes your own value and contributions. How do you feel now, after going through this thought record?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit better. The sadness and hurt are still there, but maybe more like 50 instead of 80. The shame is also a bit less intense, maybe around 70.\n\nTherapist: That's progress. It shows that by examining the evidence and reframing your thoughts, you can shift your emotions. This is a skill you can continue to practice whenever you notice those negative thoughts coming up.",
