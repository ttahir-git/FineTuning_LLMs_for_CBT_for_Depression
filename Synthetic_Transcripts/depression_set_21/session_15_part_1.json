  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our 15th session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've been providing me. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the skills we've discussed, like challenging negative thoughts and setting boundaries. It's still challenging at times, but I think I'm making some progress. I've also been keeping up with the Positive Data Log and thought records, which have been helpful in recognizing patterns in my thinking.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've discussed and finding them helpful. Recognizing progress, even if it feels small, is an important part of the process. Can you share a specific example of when you challenged a negative thought or set a boundary since our last session?\n\nPatient: One example that comes to mind is when my supervisor asked me to take on an additional project at work. Normally, I would have said yes without hesitation, even if I was already overwhelmed. But this time, I took a moment to consider my workload and my own needs. I politely explained that I wouldn't be able to take on the project without compromising the quality of my other work. It was difficult, but I felt a sense of relief afterward.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of setting a boundary at work, Priya. It takes courage to assert your needs, especially in a professional setting. How did it feel to prioritize your own well-being in that moment?\n\nPatient: It felt empowering, but also a bit scary. I think I'm still working on believing that it's okay to put my needs first sometimes. I noticed that my initial thoughts were along the lines of \"I'm letting my team down\" or \"They'll think I'm not a team player.\" But I tried to challenge those thoughts by reminding myself that setting boundaries is actually a sign of self-respect and can lead to better work quality in the long run.\n\nTherapist: You've made an important connection there, Priya. Challenging those negative thoughts and reframing them in a more balanced way is a key part of the process. It's natural to feel some fear or guilt when setting boundaries, especially if it's something new for you. But as you practice, it will likely become easier and more comfortable.\n\nGiven what you've shared so far, what would you like to focus on in today's session? We could explore more around setting boundaries, continue working on challenging negative thoughts, or address anything else that's been on your mind.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on setting boundaries, both at work and with my family. It's something I struggle with, and I know it's connected to my core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" I'd also like to discuss how my cultural background might be influencing my thoughts and behaviors around boundary-setting.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a productive agenda for today's session, Priya. We can explore the connection between your core belief and boundary-setting, as well as how your cultural background might be playing a role. Setting boundaries is a skill that takes practice, so we can also discuss some strategies for asserting your needs in a way that feels authentic and respectful.\n\nBefore we dive in, let's take a moment to check in on your emotional state. How are you feeling right now, and how has your mood been in general since our last session?\n\nPatient: Right now, I'm feeling a bit anxious about discussing boundary-setting, but also hopeful that I can make progress in this area. In general, my mood has been more stable since our last session. I've had some low moments, but I've been trying to use the skills we've discussed to cope with them. I think the thought records and Positive Data Log have been especially helpful in recognizing and challenging negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel some anxiety about discussing boundary-setting, especially if it's an area where you've faced challenges in the past. It's also great to hear that your mood has been more stable overall and that you've been able to use the skills we've discussed to cope with low moments. Recognizing and challenging negative thoughts is a key part of managing depression, and it sounds like you're making progress in that area.\n\nAs we explore boundary-setting today, we'll go at a pace that feels comfortable for you. Remember that it's okay to take breaks or let me know if something feels overwhelming. Our goal is to support your growth and well-being, not to push you beyond your limits.\n\nWith that in mind, let's start by discussing how your core belief of \"I'm not good enough\" might be connected to your struggles with setting boundaries. Can you share an example of a time when this belief influenced your ability to assert your needs?",
