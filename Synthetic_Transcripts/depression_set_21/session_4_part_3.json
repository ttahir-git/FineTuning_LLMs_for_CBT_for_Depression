  "transcript": "Therapist: You're doing a great job, Priya. Let's continue practicing reframing thoughts. Can you share another entry from your thought record where you noticed a strong emotional response?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last Friday, I was supposed to meet some friends for dinner, but I ended up canceling at the last minute. I felt really anxious and down about it. My thoughts were, \"I'm always letting people down\" and \"They probably think I'm flaky and don't want to be around me.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Priya. I can hear the distress in those thoughts. Let's look at them more closely. The thought \"I'm always letting people down\" seems to contain some overgeneralization. Can you think of times when you've been there for others or followed through on commitments?\n\nPatient: Well, I did help my neighbor with their groceries last week, and I've been consistent with my work deadlines recently.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the overgeneralization. You've shown that you can be reliable and supportive. How about the thought \"They probably think I'm flaky and don't want to be around me\"? This seems to involve mind-reading and jumping to conclusions. What evidence do you have that your friends don't want to be around you?\n\nPatient: I guess I don't have any concrete evidence. They've never said anything like that to me, and they still invite me to things even when I've canceled before.\n\nTherapist: That's an important point, Priya. Your friends continue to reach out and include you, which suggests that they value your presence and friendship. How could you reframe these thoughts based on the evidence we've discussed?\n\nPatient: I could tell myself, \"I have been reliable and supportive in other situations, so it's not true that I always let people down.\" And for the second thought, \"My friends keep inviting me to things, so they probably don't think I'm flaky or dislike me. They might be understanding about my struggles.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent reframes, Priya. You're doing a great job of recognizing the distortions and generating more balanced, evidence-based thoughts. How do these reframed thoughts impact your feelings about the situation?\n\nPatient: When I think about it this way, I feel less anxious and guilty. I can see that one cancellation doesn't define my relationships or my worth as a friend.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful insight, Priya. Reframing our thoughts can help us regulate our emotions and view situations in a more balanced, realistic way. As we continue practicing this skill, it will become easier to catch and reframe cognitive distortions in the moment.",
