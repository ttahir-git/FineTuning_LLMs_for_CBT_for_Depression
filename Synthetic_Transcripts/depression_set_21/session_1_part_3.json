  "transcript": "Patient: Well, I grew up in a family that struggled with addiction, and I think that had a big impact on me. I found solace in art and music, but I always felt like I had to be the strong one, the responsible one. When I went to college, I studied business, but I struggled academically and ended up dropping out to care for my mother. That's when my depression really started to take hold.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you've had to deal with a lot of challenges early on in your life, Priya. Growing up in a family struggling with addiction can be incredibly difficult, and it's understandable that you felt the need to take on a caretaker role. It's also common for people to experience depression during major life transitions, such as leaving college and becoming a caregiver. Can you tell me more about how you've been coping with your depression up until now?\n\nPatient: I've mostly been trying to distract myself with work. I often stay late at the office, partly because I don't want to go home to an empty house. I also buy art supplies or books sometimes, but I rarely use them. I know it's not the healthiest way to cope, but it's what I've been doing to get by.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Priya. It's not uncommon for people to use work or other distractions to cope with depression. While these strategies might provide temporary relief, they don't address the underlying issues. It's important that we work together to develop healthier coping mechanisms that support your long-term well-being. Have you ever sought professional help for your depression before?\n\nPatient: No, I haven't. I've always been hesitant to seek help, partly because of the stigma around mental health in my culture. I also felt like I should be able to handle it on my own, like I was weak for needing help.\n\nTherapist: It takes a lot of strength to recognize when you need support and to reach out for help, Priya. Many people struggle with the stigma surrounding mental health, and it can be especially challenging when cultural factors are involved. I want to reassure you that seeking help is a sign of self-awareness and courage, not weakness. In our work together, we'll challenge those negative beliefs and help you develop a more compassionate view of yourself. Can you tell me more about your support system outside of therapy?\n\nPatient: My support system is pretty limited. I don't have many close friends, and my relationship with my extended family is strained. I do attend a local art class occasionally, which helps a bit, but I still feel pretty isolated most of the time.\n\nTherapist: It's good that you have the art class as a source of support, even if it's not as frequent as you might like. Building a strong support system is an important part of managing depression, and it's something we can work on together. In addition to therapy, having connections with understanding friends, family members, or support groups can be incredibly helpful. As we continue our sessions, we'll explore ways to strengthen your existing relationships and develop new ones. How do you feel about what we've discussed so far?",
