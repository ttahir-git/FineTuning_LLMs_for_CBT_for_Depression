  "transcript": "Therapist: It's great to hear that you're open to practicing self-compassion, Priya. Remember, it's a skill that takes time and practice to develop, so be patient with yourself as you work on it. Now, let's take a moment to check in on how you're feeling. How are you doing after discussing all of this?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also hopeful. It's a lot to take in, but I'm glad we're talking about these things.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. We've covered a lot of ground today. Remember, you don't have to implement all of these techniques perfectly right away. The important thing is that you're making progress and being kind to yourself along the way. Before we wrap up, let's discuss your homework for this week. In addition to practicing the grounding exercise and progressive muscle relaxation, I'd like you to try the behavioral experiment we discussed, where you share an idea in your team meeting at work. Write down your prediction beforehand and the actual outcome afterward, and we can discuss it in our next session. I'd also like you to practice self-compassion whenever you notice yourself feeling guilty or worthless. Remind yourself that you're human and doing the best you can, and offer yourself some kindness and understanding. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: It sounds good. I'll definitely try the behavioral experiment and practice self-compassion. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Priya. I'm confident that with practice, these techniques will start to feel more natural and helpful. Remember, progress isn't always linear. There will be ups and downs, but the important thing is that you keep going and don't give up on yourself. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Priya. I'm happy to be here for you. Let's plan to meet again next week to discuss your progress and any challenges that come up. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you need any support or have any questions.\n\nPatient: Okay, I will. Thank you again.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Priya's experience with the grounding exercise and introduced progressive muscle relaxation as an additional distress tolerance technique.\n  - Explored the concept of behavioral experiments and set up an experiment for Priya to share an idea in their team meeting at work to challenge their core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\"\n  - Introduced the concept of self-compassion and discussed how Priya can practice offering themselves kindness and understanding when experiencing feelings of guilt and worthlessness.\n  - Checked in on Priya's emotional state and provided support and encouragement.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Distress tolerance: Reviewed grounding exercise and introduced progressive muscle relaxation.
