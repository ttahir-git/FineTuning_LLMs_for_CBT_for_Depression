  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our ninth session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the reframing skill we discussed. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood. I also tried to be more self-compassionate, but it's still difficult for me to do that consistently.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the reframing skill and have noticed some improvements in your mood. It's okay if self-compassion is still challenging \u2013 it's a skill that takes time to develop. Let's explore your experiences with reframing and self-compassion in more detail. Before we do that, I want to check in with you about your current emotional state. How are you feeling right now?\n\nPatient: Right now, I'm feeling a bit anxious about discussing my progress, or lack thereof. I'm worried that I haven't done enough or that I'm not improving fast enough.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel anxious about your progress, but I want to remind you that therapy is a process, and everyone moves at their own pace. There's no need to put pressure on yourself to improve quickly. We're here to work together to help you feel better, one step at a time. Let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to discuss my experiences with reframing and self-compassion, as well as explore some of the challenges I've faced in practicing these skills. I'm also interested in learning more about how my thoughts and beliefs might be contributing to my depression.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan for our session today. We can start by discussing your experiences with reframing and self-compassion, then explore any challenges you've encountered. After that, we can dive deeper into how your thoughts and beliefs might be related to your depression. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds perfect. I'm ready to get started.",
