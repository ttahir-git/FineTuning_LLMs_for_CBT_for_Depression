  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the skills we've discussed, like challenging negative thoughts and setting boundaries. It's still challenging at times, but I think I'm making some progress. I did the behavioral experiment we talked about, saying no to an extra task at work when I was feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Priya. I'm glad you've been practicing the skills we've worked on together. Saying no at work is a significant step in setting boundaries. How did it feel to do that behavioral experiment?\n\nPatient: It was really difficult in the moment. I felt guilty and worried that my colleagues would think I was lazy or not a team player. But afterward, I realized that it was okay to prioritize my own well-being and that I can't always take on extra tasks, especially when I'm already feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful insight, Priya. It's natural to feel guilty or worried about others' perceptions when setting boundaries, but it's essential to remember that taking care of yourself is not selfish. It's about maintaining a healthy balance. Let's take a moment to review your Positive Data Log. Were you able to gather any evidence against your negative core beliefs?\n\nPatient: Yes, I did. I wrote down a few instances where I received positive feedback at work or was able to complete a task successfully. It helped me see that I am capable and that my negative beliefs aren't always accurate.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Priya. Collecting evidence against your negative core beliefs is a crucial step in reframing them. Today, I'd like to focus on continuing to challenge those negative thoughts and core beliefs, as well as exploring any new situations that have come up since our last session. What would you like to prioritize in our agenda today?\n\nPatient: I'd like to discuss a recent situation with my family that brought up some difficult emotions and thoughts. I also want to talk more about setting boundaries at work, as I'm still struggling with that. And maybe we could review some of the thought records I've been working on.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Priya. Let's start with the situation with your family. Can you tell me more about what happened and the thoughts and emotions that came up for you?",
