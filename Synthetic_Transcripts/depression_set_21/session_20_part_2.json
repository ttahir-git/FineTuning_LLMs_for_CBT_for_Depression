  "transcript": "Patient: As we talk about our sessions ending, I feel a mix of emotions. I'm proud of the progress I've made, but I'm also scared that I'll backslide without our regular check-ins. I worry that I won't be able to keep using these skills on my own.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to have mixed feelings about this transition. It's a big step, and it's understandable to feel both pride in your progress and fear about the future. Let's take a closer look at that fear. What specifically are you worried might happen after our sessions end?\n\nPatient: I'm worried that without the accountability of our sessions, I'll stop using the coping cards and thought records. I'm afraid that I'll get overwhelmed by my negative thoughts again and won't be able to pull myself out of that spiral.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important concerns to address. One thing I want to highlight is that you've already been using these skills more independently between our sessions. You've been practicing with the coping cards and thought records on your own, and you've shared examples of times when you've successfully used them to manage difficult emotions. That's evidence that you're building the ability to use these tools on your own.\n\nPatient: That's true. I guess I have been using them more on my own lately. But what if I run into a situation that feels too big for me to handle with these tools?\n\nTherapist: That's where having a clear relapse prevention plan comes in. Part of our work today can be to identify potential challenges that might come up and make a specific plan for how you can use your CBT skills to cope with them. We can also discuss how to recognize when you might need additional support and how to reach out for help if needed.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. I think having a concrete plan would help me feel more confident.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And as we make that plan, we'll be drawing on the progress you've already made. You've developed a really strong understanding of how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are connected, and you've practiced shifting those patterns in a more helpful direction. Those skills will continue to be resources for you even after our sessions end.\n\nPatient: I guess I have learned a lot. It's just hard to trust that I can keep doing it on my own.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. Trusting in your own abilities can be challenging, especially when depression has made you doubt yourself for so long. What would you say to a friend who expressed a similar worry about maintaining their progress after therapy?\n\nPatient: I would probably remind them of how far they've come and all the skills they've learned. I'd tell them that it's normal to have ups and downs, but that doesn't mean they're starting back at square one. And I'd encourage them to be kind to themselves and reach out for support if they need it.\n\nTherapist: That's beautifully said, Priya. I think you've just articulated a really compassionate and helpful perspective. What do you notice about the advice you'd give to a friend compared to the worries you've been expressing about yourself?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm much harder on myself than I would be on a friend. I expect myself to be perfect at using these skills, but I know that's not realistic.\n\nTherapist: You've hit on something really important there. Often, we hold ourselves to much harsher standards than we would ever apply to others. Part of maintaining your progress will be practicing self-compassion and recognizing that perfection isn't the goal. It's about continuing to make efforts in a helpful direction, even if it's not always easy.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I need to work on being kinder to myself.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And that's a skill you can keep practicing, just like you've practiced with the thought records and coping cards. Let's take a few minutes now to review some of the key skills you've learned and how you can keep using them moving forward. We can start with the coping cards, since you mentioned those have been helpful for you recently. Can you remind me of some of the key messages on your coping cards?",
