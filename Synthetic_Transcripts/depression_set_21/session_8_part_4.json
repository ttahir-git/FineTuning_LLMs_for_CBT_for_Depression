  "transcript": "Therapist: You've been doing a great job practicing the skills we've discussed, Priya. I'd like to spend some time now exploring how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are connected, especially in relation to your experiences. Are there any specific situations or experiences you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: One thing that's been on my mind lately is my relationship with my family. I often feel like I'm not doing enough to support them, especially since my mother passed away. I feel guilty for not being there more, even though I know I have my own life and responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: That's a common struggle, Priya. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me about a recent situation where you felt this way?\n\nPatient: Last week, my sister called to tell me about some health issues she's been having. I listened and offered support, but I couldn't help but feel like I should be doing more. I started thinking, \"I'm a terrible sibling. I'm not there for her when she needs me.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Priya. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle, which shows how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all connected. In this situation, the thought \"I'm a terrible sibling. I'm not there for her when she needs me\" led to feelings of guilt. Is that right?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's exactly how I felt.\n\nTherapist: And what about your behavior in this situation? How did you respond to your sister when you were feeling this way?\n\nPatient: I tried to be supportive during the call, but I felt like I was holding back. I didn't want to overstep or say the wrong thing. After the call, I didn't reach out again, even though I wanted to check on her.\n\nTherapist: So, the thought \"I'm a terrible sibling\" not only led to feelings of guilt but also influenced your behavior, causing you to hold back and not reach out to your sister again. This is a great example of how our thoughts can impact both our emotions and our actions.\n\nPatient: I can see that now. It's just hard to break out of that cycle.\n\nTherapist: It takes practice, but you're already making progress by recognizing these patterns. Let's look at this thought, \"I'm a terrible sibling,\" and see if we can find evidence for and against it, just like we did earlier with your thought about work.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll try. Evidence for the thought could be that I don't call or visit my family as often as I'd like. I also sometimes feel disconnected from their lives.\n\nTherapist: And what about evidence against the thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I do make an effort to be there for them when they need me. I listen and offer support when I can. And even though I don't visit as often as I'd like, I do try to stay in touch through phone calls and texts.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're a terrible sibling. Based on this, how could we reframe that thought in a more balanced way?\n\nPatient: I could say something like, \"I'm doing my best to be a supportive sibling, even if I can't always be there in person. I show my love and care in the ways I can.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful reframe, Priya. How do you think this new perspective would impact your feelings and behavior in similar situations?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel less guilty and more empowered to reach out and offer support, even if it's not perfect.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Priya. By challenging these thoughts and reframing them in a more balanced way, we can start to shift our feelings and behaviors in a more positive direction. This is a skill you can practice in various situations, not just with your family.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in recognizing and challenging your thoughts. Remember, it's a practice, and it's okay if it feels challenging at times. I'd like to encourage you to continue using the thought records and reframing techniques we've discussed, both with your family and in other situations where you notice negative thoughts arising.\n\nFor homework, I'd like you to practice the reframing skill at least once a day. When you notice a negative thought, take a moment to write it down, find evidence for and against it, and then reframe it in a more balanced way. We can review your examples together in our next session.\n\nHow are you feeling about our progress today, and do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling more hopeful and empowered after our session today. It's helpful to see how my thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all connected, and I'm looking forward to practicing the reframing skill. I know it won't be easy, but I'm committed to working on it.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Priya. Remember, you don't have to do this perfectly. Every small step counts, and you're making progress. If any challenges come up during the week, feel free to jot them down, and we can discuss them in our next session.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I will. I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Priya. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's plan to meet again next week at the same time. In the meantime, take care of yourself, and remember to practice self-compassion.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you, and I'll see you next week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Explored the connection between Priya's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors using the CBT triangle, focusing on a recent situation with their family.\n  - Practiced challenging and reframing negative thoughts using evidence for and against the thought.\n  - Discussed the importance of self-compassion and continued practice of skills learned in previous sessions.\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - CBT triangle: Explored how Priya's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, using a recent situation with their family as an example.\n  - Thought records: Continued practice from previous sessions.
