  "transcript": "Patient: Some of the key messages on my coping cards are things like \"Thoughts are not facts,\" \"I am doing the best I can,\" and \"I have overcome challenges before, and I can do it again.\" I also have some cards with specific evidence against my negative core beliefs, like examples of times when I've been competent or times when people have shown they care about me.\n\nTherapist: Those are fantastic coping card messages, Priya. I'm really glad to hear that you've been able to come up with such powerful statements to counteract your negative thoughts. The fact that you've been using these cards between sessions is a great sign that you're integrating these skills into your daily life.\n\nLet's think about how you can keep using these coping cards moving forward. One idea is to set aside a specific time each day to review them, maybe first thing in the morning or right before bed. That way, you're regularly reminding yourself of these more helpful thoughts. You can also make a plan for when you'll pull out the cards in difficult moments, like when you're feeling overwhelmed by loneliness or self-doubt.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of setting aside a specific time to review them. I could keep them on my nightstand and look at them before bed. I think that would help me start and end the day on a more positive note.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. You're creating a routine that will help you keep these helpful thoughts at the forefront of your mind. And by reviewing the cards at night, you're setting yourself up to go to bed with a more compassionate mindset, which can have a big impact on your overall mood.\n\nAnother way to use the coping cards is to pair them with some of the other skills you've learned, like the thought records. When you notice a particularly strong negative thought, you can pull out a relevant coping card and use it as the starting point for a thought record. The card can help you remember to challenge that negative thought and come up with a more balanced perspective.\n\nPatient: Oh, that's a good idea. So if I have the thought \"I'm not good enough,\" I could pull out the card that says \"I am doing the best I can\" and use that as evidence against the negative thought.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! You're using the coping cards as tools to help you access more helpful thoughts in the moment. And by pairing them with the thought records, you're reinforcing the skill of challenging negative thoughts and coming up with more balanced alternatives.\n\nAs you keep practicing with these skills, you'll likely find that it gets easier to come up with helpful thoughts on your own, without always needing to rely on the cards. The goal is for these more compassionate thoughts to become your default way of thinking, so that you're automatically challenging negative thoughts as they come up.\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be really helpful. It's just hard to imagine getting to that point.\n\nTherapist: That's a totally normal concern, Priya. Shifting your thought patterns is a process, and it takes time and practice. You've already made a lot of progress in that direction, and the fact that you're using these skills on your own is a great sign that you're building those new mental habits.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't to get rid of negative thoughts completely. Everyone has negative thoughts sometimes. The key is to be able to recognize those thoughts and challenge them, rather than getting stuck in them. And you're already doing that in many moments.\n\nPatient: That's a good reminder. I guess I don't have to be perfect at this. It's okay if I still have negative thoughts sometimes, as long as I keep working on challenging them.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And the fact that you're able to recognize that now is a really good sign. You're developing more self-awareness and more ability to take a step back from your thoughts and look at them critically.\n\nAs we've been talking, I've noticed that you've been bringing up some really important insights, like the idea of being kinder to yourself and the recognition that you don't have to be perfect at using these skills. What's it like for you to hear yourself expressing those ideas?\n\nPatient: It feels a bit surreal, honestly. I think in the past, I would have dismissed those thoughts as wishful thinking or making excuses for myself. But now, I can kind of see how they're actually really important perspectives to have.\n\nTherapist: That's a really powerful realization, Priya. You're noticing a shift in how you relate to your own thoughts. In the past, you might have been quick to dismiss or minimize any thoughts that were kind or compassionate toward yourself. But now, you're able to recognize the value in those thoughts and see them as important parts of your growth.\n\nThat shift in perspective is a key part of the work we've been doing together. By challenging those old patterns of self-criticism and dismissal, you're opening up space for more helpful and compassionate ways of thinking.\n\nPatient: It's a bit of a strange feeling, but I think it's a good one. It feels like I'm starting to trust myself a bit more, like I'm more willing to believe in my own abilities and value.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Priya. Trusting in yourself and believing in your own value is such an important foundation for ongoing growth and well-being. And the fact that you're noticing that shift is a really good sign that these new thought patterns are starting to take hold.\n\nAs you continue to practice with these skills, you'll likely find that those moments of self-trust and self-compassion become more frequent and more automatic. It's a gradual process, but every time you challenge a negative thought or choose a more helpful perspective, you're reinforcing those new mental habits.\n\nPatient: I can see how that would work. It's just going to take more practice, like you said.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And the great thing is, you've already been doing that practice. You've been using the coping cards and thought records on your own, and you've been bringing those insights into our sessions. That's all evidence that you're building those new skills and making them your own.\n\nAs we move into the final phase of our work together, a big focus will be on helping you continue that practice and reinforce those new habits. We'll talk more about specific strategies for maintaining your progress and coping with any challenges that come up.\n\nFor now, let's take a moment to acknowledge the progress you've already made. You've been doing the hard work of challenging long-standing thought patterns and building new, more helpful ways of thinking. That's a huge accomplishment, and it's something to be really proud of.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It helps to hear you say that. I think I'm starting to see the progress for myself, but it's nice to have it validated by someone else too.\n\nTherapist: I'm really glad to hear that, Priya. Validation and support are such important parts of this process. And even though our sessions will be ending soon, that doesn't mean you have to go it alone. We can talk about ways to build more support into your life, whether that's through connections with friends or family, support groups, or other resources.\n\nFor now, let's transition into talking more about coping with loneliness and managing the ups and downs of your mood. Those are really important topics, and I'm glad you brought them up as priorities for today's session.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. I think I'm feeling a bit more hopeful about being able to manage on my own, but I know there will still be tough moments.",
