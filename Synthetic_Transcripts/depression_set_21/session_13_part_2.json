  "transcript": "Patient: I'm ready to dive in. Setting boundaries with my family has been a big challenge for me, but I'm starting to see how it's connected to my core belief of not being good enough.\n\nTherapist: You're making an important connection there, Priya. Our core beliefs often drive our behaviors, especially in relationships. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you set a boundary with a family member recently?\n\nPatient: Last week, my cousin asked me to help organize a family gathering. Normally, I would drop everything to help, even if it meant neglecting my own needs. But this time, I politely told her that I couldn't take on the full responsibility due to my work commitments. I offered to contribute in a smaller way instead.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of setting a healthy boundary while still showing care for your family. How did you feel after setting that boundary?\n\nPatient: I felt a mix of emotions. Part of me felt guilty for not doing more, but another part felt relieved that I didn't overcommit myself. It was challenging, but I reminded myself that setting boundaries is okay and doesn't mean I'm a bad family member.\n\nTherapist: It's normal to feel a mix of emotions when setting boundaries, especially when it goes against a long-held belief. The guilt you felt is understandable, but it's great that you also experienced relief and recognized that setting boundaries is okay. Let's look at the evidence you've gathered in your Positive Data Log that challenges your core belief of not being good enough.\n\nPatient: In my log, I wrote about small successes at work, like completing a project on time or receiving positive feedback from a colleague. I also noted moments of self-care, like taking a walk during my lunch break instead of working through it. These examples show that I am capable and worthy, even if I'm not perfect.\n\nTherapist: Those are fantastic examples, Priya! Recognizing your successes at work and moments of self-care is crucial in challenging your core belief. Each piece of evidence in your Positive Data Log helps build a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself. Let's continue to gather this evidence and explore how it relates to your thoughts and behaviors.\n\nPatient: I'm starting to see how my negative thoughts have been influencing my actions, like overcommitting myself to please others. I want to keep challenging these thoughts and setting healthier boundaries.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Priya. As we continue our work together, we'll explore more situations where you can practice setting boundaries and challenging negative thoughts. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps forward. I'm here to support you every step of the way.",
