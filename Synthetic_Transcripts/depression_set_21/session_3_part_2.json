  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I had an incident at work this week that really upset me. My boss criticized my work in front of the entire team during a meeting, saying I hadn't put in enough effort.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a challenging situation. What thoughts went through your mind when your boss said that?\n\nPatient: I immediately thought, \"I'm not good enough, I'll never be able to do this job well.\" I felt like a failure and that everyone must think I'm incompetent.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Priya. Let's examine those thoughts more closely. It seems like there might be some cognitive distortions at play here, such as all-or-nothing thinking and mind-reading. All-or-nothing thinking is when we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms, like \"I'm not good enough.\" Mind-reading is when we assume we know what others are thinking, like \"everyone must think I'm incompetent.\" Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, I can see how I jumped to those extreme conclusions. It's hard not to in the moment.\n\nTherapist: It's a common reaction, and it takes practice to catch those distortions. Let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you're not good enough at your job?\n\nPatient: Well, my boss criticized me in front of everyone, so that's pretty clear evidence.\n\nTherapist: I understand that feels significant. Let's also consider evidence on the other side. Have there been times when you've received positive feedback or successfully completed tasks at work?\n\nPatient: Now that I think about it, I did receive a good performance review a few months ago, and I recently finished a big project that my team lead praised.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're not good enough. It's important to consider the full picture. Now, what about the thought that everyone must think you're incompetent?\n\nPatient: I guess I don't really know what everyone thinks. My coworker did come up to me after the meeting and said not to take it personally, that the boss has been stressed lately.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point. We often assume we know what others are thinking, but the reality is we can't read minds. Based on the evidence, how can we reframe those initial thoughts in a more balanced way?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I made a mistake, but that doesn't mean I'm not good at my job overall. And I don't know for sure what others think of me.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Priya. You're acknowledging the situation without jumping to extreme conclusions. This is the kind of work we'll continue to do in therapy - catching those distorted thoughts and examining the evidence to come up with more balanced perspectives.\n\nPatient: It feels good to look at it that way. I guess I need to practice doing that more in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, and that's where homework comes in. Continuing to keep thought records and practice reframing will help build those skills. Let's set a goal around that. How many situations would you like to record and reframe in the coming week?\n\nPatient: I think aiming for one per day is realistic for me. I can set aside time each evening to reflect on the day and write it out.\n\nTherapist: That's a great, specific goal. One situation per day is a solid start. As we continue in therapy, we'll also work on other techniques like behavioral activation - intentionally engaging in activities that boost your mood and give you a sense of accomplishment or pleasure. We'll get into that more in future sessions.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to having more tools to manage my depression.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Priya. Remember, change takes time and practice, but you're making great progress already. Let's keep working together to build those skills. In our next session, we'll review your thought records and start to explore behavioral activation. In the meantime, keep up the good work with your homework and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.",
