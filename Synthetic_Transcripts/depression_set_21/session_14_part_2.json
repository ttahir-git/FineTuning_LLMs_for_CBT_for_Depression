  "transcript": "Patient: The situation with my family was during a video call with my siblings. They were discussing plans for an upcoming family event, and I mentioned that I might not be able to attend due to work commitments. My brother made a comment about how I always prioritize work over family, and it really hurt me. I started thinking that maybe he's right, and I'm not doing enough for my family.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that your brother's comment would hurt, Priya. Let's explore the thoughts and emotions that came up for you in that moment. What was going through your mind when he said that?\n\nPatient: I immediately felt guilty and ashamed. I thought, \"I'm a terrible sibling. I'm always letting my family down. I should be there for them no matter what.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are strong thoughts and emotions, Priya. Let's take a closer look at them. Do you notice any cognitive distortions in those thoughts, such as all-or-nothing thinking or overgeneralization?\n\nPatient: Now that I think about it, I can see some all-or-nothing thinking. I jumped to the conclusion that I'm a terrible sibling because I might miss one family event. It's not like I never spend time with them.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Priya. All-or-nothing thinking can lead us to see things in extreme terms, rather than acknowledging the nuances of a situation. Let's explore this further. What would you say is the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm a terrible sibling\"?\n\nPatient: The evidence for that thought is that I sometimes prioritize work over family events, and I don't see my siblings as often as I'd like. But the evidence against it is that I do make an effort to stay in touch, I help out when I can, and I genuinely care about my family.\n\nTherapist: You've identified some important evidence against the thought \"I'm a terrible sibling,\" Priya. It's crucial to recognize that one instance of setting boundaries or prioritizing work doesn't define your entire relationship with your family. Let's try to reframe that thought in a more balanced way. What's an alternative thought that takes both the evidence for and against into account?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"I'm not a perfect sibling, but I do my best to balance my work and family commitments. Setting boundaries is sometimes necessary for my well-being, and it doesn't mean I don't care about my family.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and compassionate thought, Priya. Reframing our thoughts in this way can help us challenge those negative core beliefs, like \"I'm not good enough.\" How do you feel when you consider this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit lighter, actually. It's a relief to recognize that I don't have to be perfect to be a good sibling. Setting boundaries is okay sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Priya. It's great to see you applying the skills we've been working on to challenge your negative thoughts and find more balanced perspectives. Remember, setting boundaries is an act of self-care, and it doesn't diminish your love for your family.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's helpful to talk through these situations with you and practice reframing my thoughts. I know it's something I need to keep working on.\n\nTherapist: You're doing excellent work, Priya. Challenging long-held beliefs takes time and practice, but you're making significant progress. Speaking of practice, let's review some of the thought records you've been working on since our last session. Can you share an example of a thought record you completed?\n\nPatient: Sure. There was a situation at work where I made a small mistake on a project, and my first thought was, \"I'm going to get fired. I'm not capable of doing this job.\" I felt anxious and hopeless. But when I looked at the evidence, I realized that I've received positive feedback on my work overall, and one small mistake doesn't define my entire performance.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of using a thought record to challenge negative thoughts, Priya. By examining the evidence objectively, you were able to reframe the situation in a more realistic light. How did your emotions change after completing the thought record?\n\nPatient: After completing the thought record, I felt less anxious and more grounded. I realized that my initial thoughts were exaggerated and not based on facts.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, Priya. Using thought records consistently can help you build resilience against those negative automatic thoughts. Let's continue to practice this skill, along with the other techniques we've discussed, like behavioral experiments and reframing core beliefs.\n\nPatient: I agree. I'm seeing how these tools can help me manage my thoughts and emotions better. It's not always easy, but it's worth the effort.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Priya. The skills you're learning in therapy take practice, but they can lead to lasting positive changes in your life. Remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself as you continue this journey.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. Your support and guidance mean a lot to me.",
