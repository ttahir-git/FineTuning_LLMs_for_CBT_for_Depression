I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last meeting. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I'm here to support you, I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a chance I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. And since our communication is text-based, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to working with you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate your commitment to helping me. Since our last session, I've been trying to keep up with the Positive Data Log and thought records. It's still challenging at times, but I'm noticing small shifts in my thinking patterns. I had a tough interaction with my sibling again, but I tried to apply some of the skills we've been working on.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've discussed, even though it's not always easy. Small shifts in thinking patterns are a significant step forward. Would you like to share more about the interaction with your sibling and how you applied the skills?\n\nPatient: Sure. My sibling called me, asking for help with a family matter. I felt that familiar sense of obligation and guilt creeping in. But I took a step back and tried to identify my automatic thoughts. I realized I was jumping to the conclusion that if I didn't help, I was a terrible sibling. I tried to challenge that thought and remind myself that setting boundaries is okay.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of catching your automatic thoughts in the moment and challenging them. Recognizing the guilt and obligation you felt, and then questioning the belief that not helping makes you a terrible sibling, is a big step. How did it feel to set that boundary?\n\nPatient: It was uncomfortable, but also a bit empowering. I still felt guilty afterward, but not as much as I usually would. I'm starting to see how my thoughts and beliefs have been driving my actions and emotions.\n\nTherapist: That discomfort you felt is normal when trying something new, especially when it challenges long-held beliefs. The sense of empowerment you mentioned is a positive sign that you're starting to see the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Let's keep exploring this. For today's agenda, what would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to discuss the boundary-setting further and maybe explore some other situations where I can practice challenging my negative beliefs. I also wanted to talk about my Positive Data Log and some of the evidence I've gathered against my core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a productive plan. We can start by discussing your experience with boundary-setting in more detail and then explore other situations where you can apply the skills we've been working on. After that, we'll review your Positive Data Log and the evidence you've collected against your core belief. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: I'm ready to dive in. Setting boundaries with my family has been a big challenge for me, but I'm starting to see how it's connected to my core belief of not being good enough.\n\nTherapist: You're making an important connection there, Priya. Our core beliefs often drive our behaviors, especially in relationships. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you set a boundary with a family member recently?\n\nPatient: Last week, my cousin asked me to help organize a family gathering. Normally, I would drop everything to help, even if it meant neglecting my own needs. But this time, I politely told her that I couldn't take on the full responsibility due to my work commitments. I offered to contribute in a smaller way instead.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of setting a healthy boundary while still showing care for your family. How did you feel after setting that boundary?\n\nPatient: I felt a mix of emotions. Part of me felt guilty for not doing more, but another part felt relieved that I didn't overcommit myself. It was challenging, but I reminded myself that setting boundaries is okay and doesn't mean I'm a bad family member.\n\nTherapist: It's normal to feel a mix of emotions when setting boundaries, especially when it goes against a long-held belief. The guilt you felt is understandable, but it's great that you also experienced relief and recognized that setting boundaries is okay. Let's look at the evidence you've gathered in your Positive Data Log that challenges your core belief of not being good enough.\n\nPatient: In my log, I wrote about small successes at work, like completing a project on time or receiving positive feedback from a colleague. I also noted moments of self-care, like taking a walk during my lunch break instead of working through it. These examples show that I am capable and worthy, even if I'm not perfect.\n\nTherapist: Those are fantastic examples, Priya! Recognizing your successes at work and moments of self-care is crucial in challenging your core belief. Each piece of evidence in your Positive Data Log helps build a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself. Let's continue to gather this evidence and explore how it relates to your thoughts and behaviors.\n\nPatient: I'm starting to see how my negative thoughts have been influencing my actions, like overcommitting myself to please others. I want to keep challenging these thoughts and setting healthier boundaries.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Priya. As we continue our work together, we'll explore more situations where you can practice setting boundaries and challenging negative thoughts. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps forward. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nTherapist: Let's continue our discussion about setting boundaries and challenging negative thoughts. You mentioned a situation with your cousin where you were able to set a boundary in a healthy way. Can you think of any other recent situations where you found it challenging to set boundaries or assert your needs?\n\nPatient: Yes, at work, I often struggle with saying no to extra projects or tasks, even when I'm already overwhelmed. I feel like I need to be the perfect employee and always go above and beyond.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, and it's quite common for people to struggle with setting boundaries at work. Let's explore this further. What thoughts go through your mind when you're asked to take on extra tasks, even when you're already overwhelmed?\n\nPatient: I think, \"If I don't do this, my boss will think I'm not a team player,\" or \"I should be able to handle this, even if it means working late.\" I feel guilty for even considering saying no.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are closely tied to your core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" It's important to recognize how these thoughts influence your emotions and behaviors. Let's challenge these thoughts using the evidence you've gathered in your Positive Data Log. What evidence do you have that contradicts the idea that saying no makes you a bad employee?\n\nPatient: Well, I've received positive feedback on my work, even when I haven't taken on every extra task. And I know that setting boundaries is important for my well-being and productivity in the long run.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Those are great examples of evidence that challenge the idea that saying no makes you a bad employee. Recognizing your worth and the importance of self-care is crucial in setting healthy boundaries. Let's practice generating an alternative thought when you're asked to take on extra tasks.\n\nPatient: Instead of thinking, \"I should be able to handle this, even if it means working late,\" I could tell myself, \"It's okay to prioritize my well-being and say no when I'm already overwhelmed. Setting boundaries is a sign of self-respect and helps me be more productive in the long run.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought! It challenges the idea that you should always push yourself beyond your limits and recognizes the value of self-care and setting boundaries. As we continue our work together, we'll practice applying this new thought pattern in different situations.\n\nTherapist: Let's continue our discussion about setting boundaries and challenging negative thoughts. You mentioned a situation with your cousin where you were able to set a boundary in a healthy way. Can you think of any other recent situations where you found it challenging to set boundaries or assert your needs?\n\nPatient: Yes, at work, I often struggle with saying no to extra projects or tasks, even when I'm already overwhelmed.

It challenges the idea that you should always push yourself beyond your limits and recognizes the value of self-care and setting boundaries. As we continue our work together, we'll practice applying this new thought pattern in different situations.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling. What thoughts and emotions are coming up for you after our discussion?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also hopeful. It's challenging to confront these negative thoughts and beliefs, but I can see how they've been holding me back. I'm eager to keep practicing these skills and building healthier thought patterns.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed when confronting long-held beliefs. Remember that change is a process, and you're making great progress. I'm here to support you every step of the way. For homework, I'd like you to continue keeping your Positive Data Log and complete at least one thought record on a situation that comes up between now and our next session. Let's also try another behavioral experiment related to setting boundaries, perhaps at work or with a family member.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll keep up with the Positive Data Log and thought records, and I'll try to set a boundary at work when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, setting boundaries is a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. If you encounter any challenges or have questions, feel free to bring them to our next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Continued exploring the connection between Priya's core belief of \"I'm not good enough\" and their struggles with setting boundaries\n  - Discussed a specific situation where Priya set a boundary with a family member and explored the thoughts and emotions that arose\n  - Identified a work situation where Priya struggles to set boundaries and challenged the negative thoughts associated with saying no\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Priya is continuing to practice identifying negative automatic thoughts, emotions, and evidence against those thoughts.
