  "transcript": "Therapist: Outside of art, what are some other hobbies or interests you have that we could explore?\n\nPatient: I used to enjoy playing the violin and singing, but I haven't done either in a long time. I also like reading and going for walks in nature.\n\nTherapist: Those are great hobbies to consider revisiting. Let's think about how engaging in these activities could help challenge your core belief \"I'm not good enough.\" For example, playing the violin or singing could provide opportunities for self-expression and creativity, while reading and walking in nature could offer moments of relaxation and reflection. How do you think engaging in these activities might impact your thoughts and feelings about yourself?\n\nPatient: I think engaging in these activities could help me feel more connected to myself and remind me of the things I enjoy and am passionate about. It might also give me a sense of accomplishment and help me see that I am capable of doing things that bring me joy, even if I'm not perfect at them.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Priya. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and provide a sense of accomplishment can be powerful in challenging negative core beliefs. It's not about being perfect; it's about allowing yourself to experience the benefits of doing things you enjoy.\n\nLet's set a goal for you to engage in at least one of these activities before our next session. Which one feels most manageable for you to start with?\n\nPatient: I think I'll start with going for a walk in nature. It feels like a good first step, and I can combine it with some light exercise, which I know is also beneficial for my mental health.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Priya. Going for a walk in nature can be a wonderful way to clear your mind, connect with your surroundings, and engage in light exercise. Remember to pay attention to your thoughts and feelings during the walk and try to challenge any negative thoughts that may arise.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best to stay mindful during the walk and challenge any negative thoughts that come up.\n\nTherapist: I'm confident you can do it, Priya. Remember, it's not about being perfect; it's about taking small steps towards challenging your negative core beliefs and engaging in activities that bring you joy and a sense of accomplishment.\n\nNow, let's revisit the concept of cognitive distortions, which we touched on in previous sessions. Cognitive distortions are common thinking patterns that can contribute to negative thoughts and emotions. One example of a cognitive distortion is \"all-or-nothing thinking,\" where you see things in extreme, black-and-white terms. Can you think of any situations where you might engage in all-or-nothing thinking?\n\nPatient: I think I engage in all-or-nothing thinking a lot, especially when it comes to my work. I often feel like if I'm not doing everything perfectly, then I'm a complete failure.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of all-or-nothing thinking, Priya. This type of thinking can be very limiting and can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Let's practice challenging this cognitive distortion using a technique called \"thinking in shades of gray.\"\n\nWhen you catch yourself engaging in all-or-nothing thinking, try to look for the gray areas or the middle ground. For example, instead of thinking \"I'm a complete failure if I don't do everything perfectly,\" you could reframe the thought as \"I may not be perfect, but I'm doing my best, and that's enough.\"\n\nPatient: I like that idea of thinking in shades of gray. It's a good reminder that things aren't always black and white, and there's room for imperfection.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Priya. Embracing the gray areas can help you develop a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself and your experiences. As you practice challenging your all-or-nothing thinking, remember to be patient with yourself. It's a process, and it's okay if you don't always get it right.\n\nAnother cognitive distortion we can explore is \"disqualifying the positive,\" where you dismiss or minimize positive experiences or feedback. Can you think of any situations where you might engage in this type of thinking?\n\nPatient: I think I often disqualify the positive when it comes to my art. Even if someone gives me a compliment on my work, I tend to brush it off or think they're just being nice.\n\nTherapist: Disqualifying the positive can be a significant barrier to building self-esteem and challenging negative core beliefs. When you dismiss positive feedback or experiences, you're essentially telling yourself that your achievements or positive qualities don't count.\n\nLet's practice challenging this cognitive distortion by actively acknowledging and accepting positive feedback and experiences. The next time someone compliments your art or you have a positive experience related to your creativity, try to let it sink in and give yourself permission to feel good about it.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to be more mindful of accepting positive feedback and experiences, even if it feels uncomfortable at first.\n\nTherapist: It's normal for it to feel uncomfortable at first, Priya. You're challenging a long-standing thinking pattern, and that takes time and practice. Remember, acknowledging and accepting the positive doesn't mean you're being arrogant or conceited; it means you're developing a more balanced and realistic view of yourself.\n\nAs you continue to practice challenging your cognitive distortions, it can be helpful to keep a thought record. A thought record is a tool that helps you identify and challenge negative thoughts and cognitive distortions. It typically includes columns for the date and time, the situation or trigger, your emotions and their intensity, the automatic thought, evidence for and against the thought, an alternative thought, and the outcome or re-rated emotion.\n\nWould you like to practice creating a thought record together now?\n\nPatient: Yes, that would be helpful. I think having a structured way to challenge my negative thoughts could be really beneficial.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start with a situation where you noticed yourself engaging in all-or-nothing thinking or disqualifying the positive. Can you describe a recent example?",
