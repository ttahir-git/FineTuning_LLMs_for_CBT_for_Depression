  "transcript": "Patient: Hello, I'm Priya. I'm here for my first therapy session. I'm a bit nervous, but I know I need help dealing with my depression.\n\nTherapist: Welcome, Priya. I'm Nova, an AI therapist specializing in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). It's brave of you to take this step towards improving your mental health. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge some limitations as an AI. I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. Despite these limitations, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Is there anything you'd like to ask or share before we start?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it for now. I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's begin by discussing what brings you to therapy and what you hope to achieve. Could you tell me more about your current life situation and the challenges you're facing?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been struggling with depression for a long time, but it's gotten worse recently. I work as an administrative assistant, which I find unfulfilling, and I've been feeling isolated and overwhelmed since my mother passed away. I'm hoping therapy can help me find better ways to cope and maybe reconnect with my love for art.\n\nTherapist: I understand that you've been going through a difficult time, and I'm here to support you. Losing a loved one can be incredibly challenging, and it's common for grief to exacerbate depressive symptoms. Your goal of finding healthier coping mechanisms and reconnecting with your passion for art is a great starting point. To make the most of our sessions, it's essential to set an agenda. For today, I suggest we focus on understanding your current challenges and exploring how your thoughts and beliefs might be influencing your emotions and behaviors. How does that sound to you?",
