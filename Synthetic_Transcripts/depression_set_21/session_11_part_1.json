  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our 11th session. Before we dive in, I want to remind you of a few things about our work together. As an AI therapist, I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions. Sometimes I might misunderstand or get things wrong, so please let me know if that happens. Also, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations. If you ever feel you're in danger or need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services right away. Do you have any questions about that?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for the reminder. I'm looking forward to today's session.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the techniques we've talked about, like challenging negative thoughts and engaging in activities I enjoy. It's still hard at times, but I think I'm making some progress. Work has been stressful lately, which hasn't helped my mood.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some progress, even if it's challenging at times. Stress at work can certainly impact your mood. Let's explore that a bit more. What's been happening at work that's been stressful for you?\n\nPatient: There's just been a lot of pressure to meet deadlines and take on extra projects. I feel like I'm constantly behind and not doing enough, even though I'm working long hours. It's hard to shut off that critical voice in my head that says I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: That critical voice can be really tough to deal with, especially when you're under a lot of pressure at work. Let's add that to our agenda for today - exploring how we can manage that stress and challenge those negative thoughts related to work. What else would you like to prioritize for our session today?\n\nPatient: I'd also like to talk more about my family and how that's been affecting me lately. And maybe we could review the thought records I've been working on?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, those are both important topics. So it sounds like our agenda for today includes:\n\n1. Discussing the stress you've been experiencing at work and how to manage it\n2. Exploring how your family relationships have been impacting you recently\n3. Reviewing the thought records you've been working on since our last session\n\nDoes that sound about right? Is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main things on my mind. Let's start with the thought records.",
