  "transcript": "Priya: I'm glad we have a plan for today's session. I'm really hoping to make some progress on these feelings of inadequacy and guilt.\n\nTherapist: I'm confident that we can make progress on those feelings today, Priya. Before we dive into that, let's take some time to review your homework from our last session. How did you find the experience of continuing with your Positive Data Log?\n\nPriya: It was challenging at first to remember to write something down every day, but I found that setting a daily reminder on my phone helped. I was surprised by how many small moments I could find that challenged my core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" Even little things, like completing a task at work or getting a compliment from a friend, started to add up.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Priya. It's great that you found a strategy to help you remember to write in your log daily. And you're absolutely right, even small moments of accomplishment or positive feedback can provide evidence against that core belief. How did it feel to actively look for and record those moments?\n\nPriya: It felt really empowering, actually. It's like I was building a case against that negative belief, piece by piece. And seeing it all written down made it harder to ignore or discount those positive experiences.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic insight, Priya. You're building a strong foundation of evidence to challenge that long-held belief. And the more you practice looking for and acknowledging those positive moments, the more automatic it will become. Let's talk a bit about your mindfulness practice. How did that go?\n\nPriya: I struggled with that a bit more, to be honest. I found it hard to carve out the time every day, and even when I did, my mind kept wandering off to my to-do list or worries about my family.\n\nTherapist: That's a very common experience, Priya. Mindfulness is a skill that takes practice, and it's normal for our minds to wander, especially when we're dealing with stress or difficult emotions. The key is to notice when your mind has wandered and gently bring your attention back to the present moment, without judging yourself for getting distracted. Did you try any guided meditations, or did you practice on your own?\n\nPriya: I tried a bit of both. I found the guided meditations helpful, but I also liked just sitting quietly and focusing on my breath for a few minutes.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you experimented with different approaches. There's no one \"right\" way to practice mindfulness - the key is finding what works for you. And even a few minutes a day can make a difference over time. Let's explore some strategies for making mindfulness a more consistent part of your routine. What do you think might help you prioritize that practice?\n\nPriya: I think setting aside a specific time each day, maybe first thing in the morning or right before bed, could help. And maybe pairing it with something I already do daily, like brushing my teeth or having my morning coffee.\n\nTherapist: Those are both excellent ideas, Priya. Pairing a new habit with an existing one can make it easier to remember and stick with it. And choosing a specific time of day can help make it a regular part of your routine. Let's talk a bit about your experience with engaging in activities that promote a sense of mastery or accomplishment. How did that go?",
