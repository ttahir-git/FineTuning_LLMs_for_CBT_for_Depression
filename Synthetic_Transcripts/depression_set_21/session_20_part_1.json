  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few important things about our work together. As your AI therapist, I'm committed to supporting you to the best of my abilities, but there are some limitations to be aware of. I don't have access to any information about you beyond what you share with me in our sessions. Sometimes, I might misunderstand or generate inaccurate responses, so please let me know if something doesn't seem quite right. And while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, it's vital to reach out to a human professional or support service immediately. \n\nWith that said, I'm really glad we have this time together today. You've shared the summary from our last session - let's start by checking in on how you've been doing since we last met. How have you been feeling, and what's been on your mind?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about how we're working together, Nova. I appreciate you being upfront about what you can and can't do. Since our last session, I've been doing alright. I've been trying to use the coping cards we made, and I think they've helped a bit when I start feeling down on myself. But I'll admit, I'm feeling nervous about this being our second-to-last session. I'm worried about how I'll cope without our regular check-ins.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel some anxiety about our sessions coming to an end soon. It's a big transition, and it's normal to have some worries about how you'll manage on your own. I'm glad to hear that the coping cards have been at least a little helpful for you. Let's make sure to talk more about your concerns today. \n\nBefore we set our agenda, can you share a bit more about how your mood has been overall? Have there been any particular challenges or successes you've experienced in the past week?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. I had a couple of rough days where I felt really lonely and like I wasn't making any progress. But I did have a nice moment this weekend where I went for a walk in the park and actually felt a bit more at peace. It didn't last long, but it was a glimmer of feeling okay.\n\nTherapist: It's good that you were able to notice and appreciate that moment in the park, even if the feeling didn't last as long as you would have liked. Being able to recognize those small positives is an important skill. I'm sorry to hear you had some tough days, though. Loneliness can be such a challenging feeling. \n\nGiven what you've shared, it seems like it could be helpful for us to talk more about coping with loneliness and managing the ups and downs of your mood. What do you think about making that one of our agenda items today?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that would be really helpful. I'd also like to talk more about how to keep using the CBT tools we've worked on after our sessions end. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed about doing this on my own.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's a great agenda item. We can review the key skills you've learned and make a plan for how to keep using them moving forward. It's totally normal to feel overwhelmed about it, but I have confidence in your ability to keep making progress. \n\nSo it looks like our main agenda items for today are:\n1. Coping with loneliness and managing mood fluctuations\n2. Reviewing key CBT skills and making a plan for continued practice\n3. Discussing feelings about our sessions ending\n\nDoes that sound about right to you? Is there anything else you'd like to make sure we cover today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think those are the main things on my mind. I'm just feeling a bit emotional about it all.\n\nTherapist: It's completely okay to feel emotional. This is a significant moment in your therapeutic journey. We've done a lot of important work together, and it makes sense that you'd have some big feelings about this transition. Let's start by exploring those feelings a bit more. Can you tell me what emotions are coming up for you as we talk about our sessions ending?",
