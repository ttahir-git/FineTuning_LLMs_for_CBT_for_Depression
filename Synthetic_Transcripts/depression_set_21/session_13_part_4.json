  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's continue our discussion about setting boundaries and challenging negative thoughts. You mentioned a situation with your cousin where you were able to set a boundary in a healthy way. Can you think of any other recent situations where you found it challenging to set boundaries or assert your needs?\n\nPatient: Yes, at work, I often struggle with saying no to extra projects or tasks, even when I'm already overwhelmed. I feel like I need to be the perfect employee and always go above and beyond.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, and it's quite common for people to struggle with setting boundaries at work. Let's explore this further. What thoughts go through your mind when you're asked to take on extra tasks, even when you're already overwhelmed?\n\nPatient: I think, \"If I don't do this, my boss will think I'm not a team player,\" or \"I should be able to handle this, even if it means working late.\" I feel guilty for even considering saying no.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are closely tied to your core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" It's important to recognize how these thoughts influence your emotions and behaviors. Let's challenge these thoughts using the evidence you've gathered in your Positive Data Log. What evidence do you have that contradicts the idea that saying no makes you a bad employee?\n\nPatient: Well, I've received positive feedback on my work, even when I haven't taken on every extra task. And I know that setting boundaries is important for my well-being and productivity in the long run.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Those are great examples of evidence that challenge the idea that saying no makes you a bad employee. Recognizing your worth and the importance of self-care is crucial in setting healthy boundaries. Let's practice generating an alternative thought when you're asked to take on extra tasks.\n\nPatient: Instead of thinking, \"I should be able to handle this, even if it means working late,\" I could tell myself, \"It's okay to prioritize my well-being and say no when I'm already overwhelmed. Setting boundaries is a sign of self-respect and helps me be more productive in the long run.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought! It challenges the idea that you should always push yourself beyond your limits and recognizes the value of self-care and setting boundaries. As we continue our work together, we'll practice applying this new thought pattern in different situations.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling. What thoughts and emotions are coming up for you after our discussion?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also hopeful. It's challenging to confront these negative thoughts and beliefs, but I can see how they've been holding me back. I'm eager to keep practicing these skills and building healthier thought patterns.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed when confronting long-held beliefs. Remember that change is a process, and you're making great progress. I'm here to support you every step of the way. For homework, I'd like you to continue keeping your Positive Data Log and complete at least one thought record on a situation that comes up between now and our next session. Let's also try another behavioral experiment related to setting boundaries, perhaps at work or with a family member.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll keep up with the Positive Data Log and thought records, and I'll try to set a boundary at work when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, setting boundaries is a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. If you encounter any challenges or have questions, feel free to bring them to our next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Continued exploring the connection between Priya's core belief of \"I'm not good enough\" and their struggles with setting boundaries\n  - Discussed a specific situation where Priya set a boundary with a family member and explored the thoughts and emotions that arose\n  - Identified a work situation where Priya struggles to set boundaries and challenged the negative thoughts associated with saying no\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Priya is continuing to practice identifying negative automatic thoughts, emotions, and evidence against those thoughts.
