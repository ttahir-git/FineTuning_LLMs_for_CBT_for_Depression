  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's good to see you again. Thank you for bringing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I can't observe or interpret non-verbal cues. Despite these limitations, I'm committed to supporting you in your journey towards better mental health. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. I'm still willing to give this a try and see how it goes.\n\nTherapist: Great, I'm glad to hear that. Let's start by setting an agenda for today's session. We'll review your thought record homework, discuss any insights or challenges you faced while completing it, and continue exploring the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors within the CBT framework. We'll also start identifying some of your specific thought patterns related to depression. How does that plan sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm curious to see what patterns emerge from my thought record.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. Let's begin by reviewing your homework. Can you share some of the thoughts and emotions you recorded over the past week?",
