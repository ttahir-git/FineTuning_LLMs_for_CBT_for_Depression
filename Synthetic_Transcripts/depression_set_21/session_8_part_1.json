  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our eighth session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I'm here to support you, I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a chance I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm committed to doing my best to help you through our sessions. How have you been since our last meeting?\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the grounding exercise and progressive muscle relaxation. I also attempted the behavioral experiment by sharing an idea in my team meeting at work. It was challenging, but I did it.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Priya. I'm glad you've been practicing the techniques and even took the brave step of sharing an idea at work. How did that experience feel for you, and what was the outcome?\n\nPatient: It was nerve-wracking, and I felt really anxious leading up to the meeting. But afterward, I felt a sense of relief and even a bit of pride. My idea was well-received, and my colleagues seemed to appreciate my contribution. It made me question my core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a significant step forward, Priya. Challenging our core beliefs through behavioral experiments can be powerful. I'm curious, how has your mood been overall since our last session?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. I've had moments of feeling a bit lighter, especially after the team meeting. But there are still times when I feel overwhelmed and struggle with feelings of worthlessness.\n\nTherapist: It's normal to have ups and downs, and it's okay not to feel okay all the time. I'm here to support you through those challenging moments. Speaking of support, how has your practice of self-compassion been going?\n\nPatient: It's been difficult. Offering myself kindness and understanding doesn't come naturally to me. I often catch myself being self-critical, and it's hard to break that habit.\n\nTherapist: Self-compassion can be challenging, especially when we're used to being self-critical. It's a practice, and it takes time to develop. Let's make sure to discuss this further today. In fact, let's take a moment to set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I'd like to talk more about self-compassion and how I can improve in that area. I'm also interested in discussing how I can continue challenging my core beliefs.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on. I'd also like to spend some time exploring the impact of your behavioral activation activities on your mood and overall well-being. We can discuss any insights or challenges that came up with your behavioral experiment, too. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to dive in.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. Let's start by discussing your experience with self-compassion. Can you tell me about a specific moment when you caught yourself being self-critical?",
