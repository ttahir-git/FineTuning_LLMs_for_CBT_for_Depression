  "transcript": "Therapist: You've been doing excellent work, Priya. I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in challenging your negative thoughts and core beliefs. It's not an easy task, but you've been consistently practicing the skills we've discussed, and it's making a difference in how you view yourself and your relationships.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a challenging journey, but I feel like I'm starting to see things in a different light. I know I still have a lot of work to do, but I'm committed to keeping at it.\n\nTherapist: Your commitment to your growth is admirable, Priya. As we continue our work together, I want to explore how we can apply the skills you've been learning to other areas of your life. You mentioned earlier that you're still struggling with setting boundaries at work. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nPatient: Yes, setting boundaries at work is still a challenge for me. I often feel like I need to say yes to every request or task, even if I'm already overwhelmed. I worry that if I don't, my colleagues or supervisor will think I'm not a team player or that I'm not capable of handling my responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: It's common for people to struggle with setting boundaries at work, Priya. The fear of being judged or perceived as not capable can be powerful. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a recent situation where you struggled to set a boundary at work?\n\nPatient: Last week, my supervisor asked me to take on an additional project, even though I'm already working on several others. I wanted to say no, but I was worried about how it would look. I ended up saying yes, but now I'm feeling overwhelmed and stressed about how I'm going to manage it all.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Priya. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle. What thoughts were going through your mind when your supervisor asked you to take on the additional project?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"If I say no, my supervisor will think I'm not a team player. They might question my commitment to the job. I should be able to handle this, even if I'm already busy.\"\n\nTherapist: And what emotions did you feel in that moment?\n\nPatient: I felt anxious, stressed, and a bit guilty for even considering saying no.\n\nTherapist: And what was the behavior that resulted from those thoughts and emotions?\n\nPatient: I said yes to the project, even though I was already overwhelmed with my current workload.\n\nTherapist: This is a clear example of how our thoughts and emotions can influence our behaviors, Priya. The thought that your supervisor would judge you for saying no led to feelings of anxiety and guilt, which resulted in the behavior of taking on more than you could handle. Let's challenge some of those thoughts using the skills we've been practicing.",
