  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for the CBT session transcript with Priya:\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think discussing the interaction with my sibling is important, as it really brought up a lot of those familiar feelings of not being good enough.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging those interactions can be, especially when they trigger deeply held beliefs about ourselves. Before we dive into that, let's take a look at your Positive Data Log. Were you able to gather any evidence that challenges your core belief of \"I'm not good enough\"?\n\nPatient: I did make some entries in the log, though it was difficult at times to think of examples. One thing I noted was that I received a compliment from a coworker on a project I had been working on. They said I had done a great job, and it felt good to hear that.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of evidence that challenges your core belief. How did it feel to record that in your log?\n\nPatient: It felt a bit strange at first, because I'm not used to focusing on positive things about myself. But it did help to see it written down, like it made it more real somehow.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience when we start to challenge long-held beliefs. It can feel uncomfortable or even a bit unnatural at first, but with practice, it becomes easier to recognize and accept the evidence that contradicts our negative beliefs. Let's look at another entry from your log, if you're comfortable sharing.\n\nPatient: Sure. Another thing I wrote down was that I was able to assert myself with a family member about a decision that affected me. It was hard, but I stood my ground and expressed my needs.\n\nTherapist: That's a powerful example of challenging your belief that you're not good enough. Asserting yourself and expressing your needs is a sign of self-respect and self-worth. How did it feel to do that?\n\nPatient: It was scary, but also empowering. I felt like I was taking a step towards valuing myself more.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. These examples from your Positive Data Log are important pieces of evidence that contradict your core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" As we continue to gather more evidence like this, it will become easier to challenge that belief and build a more balanced, compassionate view of yourself.",
