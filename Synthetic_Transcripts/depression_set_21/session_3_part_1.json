  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our third session. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last meeting. It's important that we build upon the progress we've made so far. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate, and I want you to feel comfortable letting me know if something doesn't resonate with you. Lastly, I want to remind you that if you ever experience thoughts of self-harm or suicide, it's crucial to seek immediate help from a qualified professional or emergency service, as I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. It's good to know what to expect from our sessions. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's begin by setting an agenda for today's session. I'd like to start by reviewing your homework from last week, where you continued to keep a thought record and practice identifying cognitive distortions. We'll also work on finalizing our conceptualization of your depression and begin setting specific, measurable goals for your therapy. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm curious to see what patterns emerge from my thought records.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're interested in exploring those patterns. Let's start by looking at your thought record. Can you share with me a situation from the past week where you experienced a strong emotion and the thoughts that accompanied it?",
