  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that comes to mind is when my sister asked me to help her move on a weekend when I had already made plans with some friends. My initial thought was that I had to say yes because that's what a good sibling would do. I felt guilty even considering saying no.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Priya. Let's break this down using the CBT framework. The situation or trigger was your sister asking for help. The emotion you experienced was guilt, and the automatic thought was \"I have to say yes because that's what a good sibling would do.\" Does that sound accurate?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sums it up well.\n\nTherapist: Now, let's explore the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence supports the idea that you have to say yes to be a good sibling?\n\nPatient: Well, I've always been taught that family comes first and that we should be there for each other no matter what. Saying no feels like I'm not living up to that expectation.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable given your cultural background and family values. Now, let's consider the evidence against this thought. What are some reasons why it might be okay to say no in this situation?\n\nPatient: I guess one reason is that I had already made plans with my friends, and it's important to honor those commitments too. Another reason is that I need time for self-care and relaxation, and constantly putting others' needs before my own can lead to burnout and resentment.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid points, Priya. It's important to find a balance between supporting your family and taking care of your own needs. Saying no doesn't mean you're a bad sibling; it means you're setting healthy boundaries and prioritizing your well-being.\n\nLet's try reframing the original thought in a more balanced way. Instead of \"I have to say yes because that's what a good sibling would do,\" what's an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence for and against?\n\nPatient: I could reframe it as \"I can be a good sibling while also setting boundaries and taking care of myself. Saying no in this situation doesn't negate all the other times I've been there for my family.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Priya! It acknowledges the importance of family while also recognizing the need for self-care and boundary-setting. How does this new thought feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It feels more balanced and less guilt-inducing. I can see how challenging the original thought and considering the evidence against it can lead to a more adaptive perspective.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! This is the essence of cognitive restructuring \u2013 identifying negative automatic thoughts, examining the evidence for and against them, and reframing them in a more balanced way. As we practice this skill, it will become easier to catch and challenge these thoughts in the moment.\n\nNow, let's discuss how you can apply this skill to setting boundaries with your family in the future. What are some steps you can take to assert your needs while still honoring your family values?\n\nPatient: One step could be to communicate my needs and boundaries clearly and calmly, without apologizing or making excuses. I could also try to find a compromise when possible, like offering to help my sister on a different day that works better for me.\n\nTherapist: Those are great ideas, Priya. Communicating assertively and finding compromises when possible can help you set boundaries while still maintaining positive relationships with your family. Remember that it's okay to start small and build up to more challenging boundary-setting situations over time.\n\nAs you practice setting boundaries, it will be important to continue challenging the negative thoughts that arise and reframing them in a more balanced way. This is where the Positive Data Log can be helpful \u2013 you can use it to gather evidence that supports your new, more adaptive beliefs about boundary-setting.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can see how the Positive Data Log can help me build confidence in my ability to set boundaries over time.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! The more evidence you gather that supports your new beliefs, the easier it will become to challenge the old, negative ones. And as you set boundaries and see that the outcomes are generally positive, it will reinforce the idea that setting boundaries is healthy and necessary.\n\nBefore we move on, let's check in on how you're feeling about this discussion on boundary-setting. Has it brought up any other thoughts or emotions for you?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a mix of emotions. On one hand, I feel empowered and hopeful that I can make progress in this area. On the other hand, I'm still a bit anxious about putting these skills into practice, especially with my family.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions when discussing a challenging topic like boundary-setting. It's great that you're feeling empowered and hopeful, as those emotions can motivate you to keep practicing these skills. At the same time, it's okay to feel anxious about putting them into practice. Remember that it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps and go at your own pace.\n\nAs we continue to work on boundary-setting, we can explore any anxious thoughts that come up and challenge them using the same process we've been discussing. We can also brainstorm ways to manage the anxiety that feels manageable for you, like deep breathing exercises or positive self-talk.\n\nPatient: That sounds helpful. I think I just need to remind myself that it's okay to start small and that I don't have to do everything perfectly right away.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Priya. Boundary-setting is a skill that takes practice, and it's okay to start with smaller, less intimidating situations and work your way up to more challenging ones. Remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself throughout the process.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and discuss how your cultural background might be influencing your thoughts and behaviors around boundary-setting. Can you share a bit about how your culture views family obligations and boundary-setting?",
