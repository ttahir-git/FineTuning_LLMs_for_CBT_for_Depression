  "transcript": "Therapist: It's great that you're taking the time to reflect on your Positive Data Log and choose meaningful examples for your coping cards, Priya. As you're doing that, I want to introduce a concept that can be really helpful in solidifying the progress you've made. It's called \"becoming your own therapist.\" The idea is that you've learned a lot of valuable skills and insights through our work together, and now it's about applying those tools independently in your daily life. What are your thoughts on that concept?\n\nPatient: It makes sense, but it also feels a little daunting. I've gotten used to having your guidance and support. I worry that I might struggle to apply the skills on my own.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common concern, Priya, and it's completely understandable. The truth is, you've already been doing a lot of the work independently between our sessions. You've been practicing thought records, using coping cards, and engaging in mastery activities on your own. Becoming your own therapist is about building confidence in those skills and trusting that you have the tools you need to handle challenges as they come up. It doesn't mean you'll never face difficulties again, but it means you'll be better equipped to navigate them.\n\nPatient: I guess that's true. I have been doing the work outside of our sessions. It's just hard to give myself credit for that sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, and it ties back to the core belief we've been working on challenging: \"I'm not good enough.\" Part of becoming your own therapist is learning to recognize and celebrate your own progress and strengths. One way to practice that is by doing a thought record about the experience of therapy itself. We could explore your thoughts and feelings about the progress you've made and your ability to continue using these skills independently. What do you think about giving that a try?\n\nPatient: Okay, I'm willing to try it. How would we start?\n\nTherapist: Let's start by identifying the situation: you're nearing the end of therapy and facing the idea of becoming your own therapist. What thoughts come up for you around that situation?\n\nPatient: Well, I have the thought \"I'm not sure if I can do it on my own.\" And I guess that brings up feelings of anxiety and self-doubt.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important thoughts and feelings to explore. Let's write those down. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you can't do it on your own?\n\nPatient: I guess the fact that I've struggled with depression for a long time, and I've needed therapy to help me make progress. That makes me worry that I'll struggle again without that support.\n\nTherapist: That's valid evidence, and it makes sense why that would contribute to your anxiety. Now, let's look at the evidence against that thought. What evidence do you have that you can continue using these skills independently?\n\nPatient: Well, like you said, I have been practicing the skills on my own between sessions. And I have made progress in changing my thought patterns and engaging in more self-care. I guess that's evidence that I can do it.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! That's really strong evidence that you have the ability to continue this work independently. Let's write that down too. Now, looking at the evidence for and against, what might be a more balanced thought?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like \"I've struggled in the past, but I've also made significant progress and developed new skills. It might be challenging at times, but I have evidence that I can continue using these tools on my own.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great balanced thought, Priya. How does it feel to say that out loud?\n\nPatient: It feels more empowering. Like I'm acknowledging the challenges but also recognizing my own strengths and abilities.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful. That balanced thought is a great example of becoming your own therapist. You're using the skills you've learned to challenge negative thoughts and develop a more realistic and empowering perspective. As we continue this work, we'll keep practicing that process and building your confidence in your own abilities.\n\nPatient: Okay, that makes me feel more hopeful about being able to handle things after therapy ends.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that, Priya. Remember, becoming your own therapist doesn't mean you'll never face challenges again, but it means you'll have the tools and the resilience to navigate those challenges in a healthier way. And if you do find yourself struggling, you can always reach out for support, whether that's to a therapist or to other sources of support in your life.",
