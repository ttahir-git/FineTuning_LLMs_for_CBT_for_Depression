  "transcript": "Patient: After I set the boundary with my cousin, I felt guilty at first, like I was letting my family down. But I also felt a sense of relief, knowing that I was taking care of myself and my needs.\n\nTherapist: It's common to feel a mix of emotions after setting a boundary, including guilt and relief. It's great that you were able to recognize both the challenge and the empowerment in that experience. Did you complete a thought record about the boundary-setting experience, as we discussed last session?\n\nPatient: Yes, I did. It helped me challenge some of those guilty thoughts and see the situation from a different perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful that you were able to use the thought record to challenge those guilty thoughts. Can you walk me through the thought record you completed? What was the situation, your initial thoughts and emotions, and how did you challenge those thoughts?\n\nPatient: The situation was when I told my cousin I couldn't babysit every weekend anymore. My initial thought was \"I'm being selfish and letting my family down.\" I felt guilty, with an intensity of about 80%. \n\nTherapist: Okay, so the situation was setting the boundary with your cousin, and your initial thought was \"I'm being selfish and letting my family down,\" with a strong feeling of guilt. What evidence did you find that supported or refuted this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, evidence that supported the thought was that my cousin seemed disappointed and I know how much they rely on me. But evidence against the thought was that I'm not responsible for solving all my family's problems, and I need time for myself too. I also realized that setting boundaries is actually a form of self-care and can help prevent resentment in the long run.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent analysis, Priya. You identified evidence on both sides and came to a more balanced perspective. How did your emotions change after going through this process?\n\nPatient: After challenging the thought, my guilt decreased to about 40%. I still felt a bit guilty, but I also felt empowered and knew I was doing the right thing for myself.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that challenging the thought helped reduce your guilt and increase your sense of empowerment. This is a perfect example of how thought records can help us reframe situations and find more balanced, helpful perspectives. Let's continue to practice this skill.\n\nNow, I'd like to introduce the concept of cognitive and behavioral experiments. These experiments can help us test out and gather evidence against our negative beliefs. For example, if you have the belief \"I'm not good enough,\" we could design an experiment where you try something new or challenging and observe the outcome. This can provide concrete evidence to counter that negative belief. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: It sounds interesting, but I'm not sure what kind of experiment I could do. Can you give me an example?\n\nTherapist: Sure, let's brainstorm an experiment together. One negative belief we've identified is \"I'm not good enough.\" What's a situatio",
