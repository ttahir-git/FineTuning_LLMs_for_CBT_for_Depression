  "transcript": "Patient: One moment that stands out is when I made a small mistake at work last week. I caught myself thinking, \"I'm so incompetent. I can't do anything right.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Priya. Those self-critical thoughts can be quite distressing. Let's explore this further using a thought record. Can you walk me through the situation and the emotions you experienced?\n\nPatient: It was last Wednesday. I accidentally sent an email to the wrong person, and I felt embarrassed and frustrated with myself. On a scale of 0 to 10, my embarrassment was at an 8, and my frustration was at a 7.\n\nTherapist: I understand how that situation could trigger those emotions. Now, let's identify the automatic thought that arose in that moment. You mentioned thinking, \"I'm so incompetent. I can't do anything right.\" Is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's the thought that kept running through my mind.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're incompetent and can't do anything right?\n\nPatient: Well, I made that mistake with the email, and I've made other small mistakes at work before. I also didn't finish my college degree, which sometimes makes me feel like I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: I hear you. Now, let's consider the evidence against that thought. What are some examples of times when you have been competent and done things right?\n\nPatient: When I think about it, I've received positive feedback from my colleagues and supervisors on multiple occasions. I've also been trusted with additional responsibilities at work. And outside of work, I've been able to support my family and friends during difficult times.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're incompetent and can't do anything right. Based on this evidence, how can we reframe that original thought in a more balanced way?\n\nPatient: I guess I could say, \"I'm human, and humans make mistakes sometimes. One mistake doesn't define my overall competence.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful reframe, Priya. Now, if you were to apply this new perspective to the situation, how do you think it would impact your emotions?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel less embarrassed and frustrated. Maybe my embarrassment would be at a 4 and my frustration at a 3.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in your emotional response. This is a great example of how challenging our thoughts can impact how we feel. Let's continue to practice this skill, as it's a powerful tool in managing depressive symptoms.\n\nPatient: I appreciate you walking me through that process. It helps to see how my thoughts can influence my emotions.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad it's helpful, Priya. As we continue to work on self-compassion, remember that offering yourself understanding and kindness is a practice. It's okay if it feels challenging at first. With time and repetition, it will become more natural.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the encouragement. I'll keep practicing.\n\nTherapist: You're doing great, Priya. Remember, every small step counts, and you're making progress. Let's continue to explore how we can build on this skill in our future sessions.",
