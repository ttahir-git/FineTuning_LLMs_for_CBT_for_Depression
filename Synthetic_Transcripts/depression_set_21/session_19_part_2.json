  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your Positive Data Log. How has it been going with recording evidence against your core belief \"I'm not good enough\"? What insights have you gained from doing this exercise?\n\nPatient: It's been challenging at times, but also really eye-opening. When I take the time to actually write down evidence against that core belief, it helps me see things in a different light. Like, I noticed that I often dismiss my accomplishments as \"no big deal\" or \"something anyone could do,\" but when I write them down, I can start to see that they actually are significant.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Priya. It's so common for us to discount our accomplishments or strengths, especially when we have a deeply ingrained negative core belief like \"I'm not good enough.\" The Positive Data Log can help us start to build a more balanced and realistic view of ourselves. Can you share an example of something you recorded this week that challenged that core belief?\n\nPatient: Well, one thing that came up was a project I completed at work. My boss praised me for doing a great job, but my initial reaction was to think \"I just got lucky\" or \"It wasn't that impressive.\" But when I wrote it down in my log, I tried to look at it objectively. I realized that I had put in a lot of effort, used my skills effectively, and went above and beyond what was expected. It felt good to acknowledge that.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example of how the Positive Data Log can help shift our perspective. You were able to recognize your own effort, skills, and achievements, even though your initial reaction was to discount them. That's a big step in challenging that core belief. How did it feel emotionally to record and reflect on that evidence?\n\nPatient: It felt empowering, honestly. Like I was taking back some control over how I see myself. It's still a work in progress, but it felt good to have concrete evidence to look back on when that negative voice in my head gets loud.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that it felt empowering, Priya. That's the power of actively challenging those negative core beliefs. It's okay that it's a work in progress - the fact that you're practicing this skill and noticing a difference is what's most important. As we continue this work, that voice will likely get quieter and quieter as you build up more and more evidence against it.\n\nPatient: I hope so. It's just hard sometimes to remember to do it in the moment, you know? When I'm feeling down or overwhelmed, it's like all those positive examples fly out the window.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common challenge, and it's something we can definitely work on. One strategy that can help is using coping cards. We've talked about them before, but as a refresher, coping cards are like little reminders of the skills and evidence you've been building. You can write down some of the most powerful examples from your Positive Data Log, or some of the balanced thoughts you've come up with to challenge your negative core beliefs. Then, when you're feeling overwhelmed, you can pull out those cards and remind yourself of the work you've been doing.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I have been using the coping cards we made, but maybe I could make some new ones with examples from my Positive Data Log.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Priya. You can tailor the coping cards to what's most helpful for you. Maybe we can take a few minutes now to look through your Positive Data Log and pick out some examples that feel particularly meaningful or powerful to put on new coping cards. What do you think?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I'd like that. Let me pull up my log.\n\nTherapist: Great. As you're looking through, try to notice which examples really stand out to you or resonate emotionally. Those might be good ones to put on your coping cards.",
