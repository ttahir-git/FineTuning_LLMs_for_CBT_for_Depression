  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the skills we've discussed, like challenging negative thoughts and engaging in activities that give me a sense of accomplishment. It's been helpful, but I still have moments where I struggle with feelings of inadequacy and guilt, especially when it comes to my family.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've worked on, Priya. It's normal to still experience challenges and difficult emotions, even as you make progress. I'm here to support you through those moments. You mentioned struggling with feelings of inadequacy and guilt related to your family. Would you like to explore that further today?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I feel like I'm always falling short when it comes to supporting my family, and it's hard to shake that belief, even though I know it's not entirely rational.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging it can be to change long-held beliefs, especially when they're tied to important relationships. Let's add exploring those feelings and beliefs to our agenda for today. What else would you like to focus on in our session?\n\nPatient: I'd also like to talk about how I can continue to practice self-compassion and mindfulness. I've found those strategies helpful, but I struggle with consistency.\n\nTherapist: That's a great addition to our agenda. We can discuss strategies for making self-compassion and mindfulness a more regular part of your routine. Is there anything else you'd like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: Those are the main things on my mind. I think that covers it for now.\n\nTherapist: Alright, so our agenda for today includes:\n1. Exploring feelings of inadequacy and guilt related to your family\n2. Strategies for practicing self-compassion and mindfulness consistently\n3. Checking in on your progress with challenging negative thoughts and engaging in mastery activities\n\nDoes that sound good to you, Priya? Is there anything you'd like to add or change?",
