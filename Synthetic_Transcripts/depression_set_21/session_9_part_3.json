  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's continue our discussion about your core belief \"I'm not good enough.\" You mentioned that you often feel like you're not performing as well as you should be at work, even though you're putting in a lot of effort. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nPatient: Well, I frequently stay late at the office to make sure I complete all my tasks, but I still feel like I'm not meeting expectations. I see my colleagues leaving on time, and I wonder if they're just more efficient or better at their jobs than I am.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you're comparing yourself to your colleagues and assuming that because they leave on time, they must be performing better than you. This could be an example of a cognitive distortion called \"jumping to conclusions.\" We don't have all the information about your colleagues' work or circumstances, so it may not be a fair comparison. Let's explore this further. What evidence do you have that you're not meeting expectations at work?\n\nPatient: I guess I don't have any concrete evidence. I haven't received any negative feedback from my supervisor, but I still feel like I should be doing more.\n\nTherapist: That's a good observation, Priya. It's important to distinguish between feelings and facts. Just because we feel a certain way doesn't necessarily mean it's true. Let's look at the evidence that you are meeting expectations at work. You mentioned earlier that you've received positive feedback at times. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nPatient: Well, a few months ago, my supervisor praised me for my attention to detail on a project. And last week, a colleague thanked me for helping them with a difficult task.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of evidence that you are performing well at work, Priya. It's important to give those experiences the weight they deserve, rather than discounting them because of how you feel. Let's try reframing your original thought about not meeting expectations at work. What's a more balanced way to look at the situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"Even though I sometimes feel like I'm not meeting expectations, there is evidence that I am performing well at work, such as positive feedback from my supervisor and colleagues.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Priya! It acknowledges your feelings while also considering the evidence. How do you feel when you think about it that way?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit lighter, less anxious about my performance at work. It's still hard to fully believe it, but I can see how changing my thoughts can impact my emotions.\n\nTherapist: You're making an important connection, Priya. Our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. By reframing your thoughts, you can start to shift your emotions and even your actions. Speaking of actions, I'd like to introduce a technique called behavioral activation. It involves intentionally engaging in activities that promote positive emotions and a sense of accomplishment, even when you don't feel motivated to do so. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: It makes sense, but it's hard to imagine doing activities when I'm feeling down. I usually just want to stay in bed or zone out in front of the TV.\n\nTherapist: That's a common response to depression, Priya. The key is to start small and choose activities that are meaningful to you. For example, you mentioned earlier that you find some comfort in attending a local art class. That could be a great activity to schedule into your week, even if you don't feel like going in the moment. What are some other activities that you enjoy or that give you a sense of accomplishment?\n\nPatient: I used to enjoy playing the violin, but I haven't picked it up in years. And I do feel a sense of accomplishment when I complete a project at work, even if it's not perfect.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples, Priya. Playing the violin and completing work projects are both activities that could boost your mood and give you a sense of accomplishment. I'd like to challenge you to schedule at least one of those activities into your week, even if you don't feel like doing them in the moment. Remember, the goal is to engage in the activity, not necessarily to enjoy it or do it perfectly. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: It sounds challenging, but I'm willing to give it a try. I can start by setting aside some time to practice the violin this weekend.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Priya! Remember to be kind and compassionate with yourself as you try this new technique. It's okay if it feels difficult or if you don't enjoy the activity as much as you used to. The important thing is that you're taking steps to engage in meaningful activities that can help improve your mood.",
