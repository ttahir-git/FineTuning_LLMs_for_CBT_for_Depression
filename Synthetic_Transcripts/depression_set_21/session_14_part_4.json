  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's challenge the thought that your supervisor will think you're not a team player if you say no to the additional project. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess I don't have any concrete evidence. It's more of a fear or assumption based on my own beliefs about what it means to be a good employee.\n\nTherapist: That's an important insight, Priya. Our assumptions and beliefs can often lead to negative automatic thoughts, even if there isn't evidence to support them. Now, what evidence do you have against the thought that your supervisor will think you're not a team player?\n\nPatient: Well, my supervisor has always been supportive and understanding in the past. They've encouraged me to communicate when I'm feeling overwhelmed and have helped me prioritize tasks when needed.\n\nTherapist: That's significant evidence against the negative thought, Priya. It suggests that your supervisor values open communication and wants to support you in managing your workload effectively. Let's reframe the thought in a more balanced way. What's an alternative thought that takes both the evidence for and against into account?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"My supervisor is likely to understand if I communicate that I'm already at capacity with my current projects. Saying no to an additional project doesn't mean I'm not a team player. It means I'm being realistic about my limits and prioritizing my well-being.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and adaptive thought, Priya. How do you feel when you consider this alternative perspective?\n\nPatient: I feel less anxious and more empowered. It makes me realize that setting boundaries at work is not only okay but necessary for my well-being and productivity.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful realization, Priya. Setting boundaries is a crucial skill, both in work and personal life. It's great to see you applying the reframing techniques we've been practicing to challenge your negative thoughts about boundary-setting.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's helpful to walk through these situations with you and practice reframing my thoughts. I know it's something I need to keep working on, but I feel more equipped to handle these challenges now.\n\nTherapist: You're doing excellent work, Priya. As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling and if there's anything else you'd like to discuss before we finish.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling good, Nova. Our sessions always help me gain clarity and feel more grounded. I don't have anything else to discuss today, but I appreciate you checking in.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Priya. Before we end, let's discuss your homework for the next session. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought records and reframing techniques we've been working on. Try to complete at least one thought record on a situation that comes up between now and our next session, particularly if it relates to setting boundaries at work or with your family.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll make sure to practice the thought records and reframing techniques. Is there anything else you'd like me to work on?\n\nTherapist: In addition to the thought records, I'd like you to try another behavioral experiment related to setting boundaries at work. When a situation arises where you feel overwhelmed or need to say no, try setting a clear and assertive boundary. Then, observe the outcome and reflect on how it compares to your initial fears or assumptions.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll try to do another behavioral experiment at work. It's still scary, but I know it's important for my well-being and growth.\n\nTherapist: It's natural to feel some fear or discomfort when setting boundaries, Priya. But as you practice and gather evidence through these experiments, it will become easier over time. Remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself throughout this process.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll do my best to complete the homework and keep practicing the skills we've been working on.\n\nTherapist: I have no doubt you will, Priya. You've been consistently putting in the effort, and it shows in the progress you're making. If any challenges or questions come up between now and our next session, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I'll keep that in mind. Until next time.\n\nTherapist: Until next time, Priya. Take care of yourself.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Continued exploring the connection between Priya's core belief of \"I'm not good enough\" and their struggles with setting boundaries, particularly at work\n  - Discussed a specific situation where Priya felt guilty for considering saying no to an additional project at work\n  - Challenged the negative thoughts associated with setting boundaries using evidence for and against and reframed the thoughts in a more balanced way\n  - Checked in on Priya's emotional state and progress with practicing CBT skills\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Priya is continuing to practice identifying negative automatic thoughts, emotions, and evidence against those thoughts.
