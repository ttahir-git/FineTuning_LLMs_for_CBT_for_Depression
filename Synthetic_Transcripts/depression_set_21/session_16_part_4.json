  "transcript": "Therapist: Of course, Priya. Your relationship with your family is a significant part of your life and your identity. Let's explore how it might be connected to your core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\"\n\nPatient: Well, growing up, there was always a lot of emphasis on achievement and success in my family. My parents had high expectations, and I often felt like I couldn't meet them. Even now, I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself to my family.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable how those early experiences could contribute to a core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" The messages we receive from our family and culture can have a powerful impact on how we see ourselves. Can you give me an example of a recent situation where you felt like you were trying to prove yourself to your family?\n\nPatient: Just last week, my sister called to tell me about my nephew's latest achievement. He got into a prestigious summer program. I was happy for him, but I also felt this sense of pressure, like I need to achieve something impressive too.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's break it down using the CBT triangle. The situation was your sister telling you about your nephew's achievement. What thoughts and emotions came up for you in that moment?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I'm not accomplishing enough. I should be doing something impressive like my nephew.\" I felt inadequate and anxious.\n\nTherapist: And how did those thoughts and emotions influence your behavior? What did you do after that phone call?\n\nPatient: I started looking up graduate programs online, thinking maybe I should go back to school and prove myself. But then I got overwhelmed and just closed my laptop.\n\nTherapist: That's a really clear example of how our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are all interconnected. The thought \"I'm not accomplishing enough\" led to feelings of inadequacy and anxiety, which then influenced your behavior of frantically searching for ways to prove yourself.\n\nThis is a pattern we've seen come up in various areas of your life - at work, with your family, and even in your personal goals. It's all tied to that core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\"\n\nPatient: I see that now. It's like I'm constantly trying to prove my worth, but it never feels like enough.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And that's why we're working on challenging and reframing that core belief. As we continue to gather evidence and practice new ways of thinking, it will start to shift.\n\nWe're coming to the end of our session today, but I want to leave you with a homework assignment. In addition to the Positive Data Log we discussed earlier, I'd like you to do a thought record on a situation where you feel pressured to prove yourself to your family. Walk through the CBT triangle - identify the situation, your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Then try to challenge those thoughts and find a more balanced perspective.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can do that. It'll be good practice for me to apply these skills to my family relationships.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And remember, the goal isn't to dismiss your family's expectations or achievements, but rather to find a way to value yourself regardless of external factors.\n\nBefore we wrap up, I want to check in on how you're feeling now. What's your mood like after our session today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit drained, to be honest. This is heavy stuff. But I also feel hopeful and motivated to keep working on myself.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel drained after doing this kind of emotional work. Remember to practice self-care and be patient with yourself. And I'm glad to hear you're feeling hopeful and motivated. Those are great signs of progress.\n\nThank you for your hard work and openness today, Priya. I'm proud of the insights you're gaining and the effort you're putting into therapy. Remember to complete your thought record and Positive Data Log for homework, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next session. Take care, and I'll see you next time.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewing Priya's boundary-setting experience with their cousin and the thought record they completed\n  - Introducing cognitive and behavioral experiments to test and challenge negative beliefs\n  - Discussing the connection between Priya's family relationships and their core belief of \"I'm not good enough\"\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought Records: Reviewed Priya's thought record on their boundary-setting experience, reinforcing the skill of challenging negative thoughts and finding more balanced perspectives.\n  - Cognitive and Behavioral Experiments: Introduced the concept of experiments to test and gather evidence against negative beliefs.
