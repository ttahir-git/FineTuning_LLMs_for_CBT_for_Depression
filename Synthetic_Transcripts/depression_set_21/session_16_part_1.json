  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our 16th session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI before we begin. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a chance I could generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week, but I've been trying to apply the skills we've discussed. I did set a boundary with my cousin about not always being available to babysit, and it was difficult but also a bit empowering.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you were able to set that boundary with your cousin. It's a big step and can definitely feel challenging, especially at first. How did you feel after setting the boundary?\n\nPatient: I felt guilty at first, like I was letting my family down. But I also felt a sense of relief, knowing that I was taking care of myself and my needs.\n\nTherapist: It's common to feel a mix of emotions after setting a boundary, including guilt and relief. It's great that you were able to recognize both the challenge and the empowerment in that experience. Did you complete a thought record about the boundary-setting experience, as we discussed last session?\n\nPatient: Yes, I did. It helped me challenge some of those guilty thoughts and see the situation from a different perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful that you were able to use the thought record to challenge those guilty thoughts. We can review that together in a bit. For now, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to discuss the boundary-setting experience in more detail and also talk about how I can continue to challenge my negative core beliefs about not being good enough.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. I'd also like to spend some time introducing cognitive and behavioral experiments, which can be helpful in testing out and challenging negative beliefs. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm curious to learn more about the experiments.\n\nTherapist: Alright, so our agenda for today includes: 1) Reviewing your boundary-setting experience and thought record, 2) Discussing how to continue challenging your negative core belief of \"I'm not good enough,\" and 3) Introducing cognitive and behavioral experiments. Let's start by reviewing your boundary-setting experience. Can you walk me through what happened?",
