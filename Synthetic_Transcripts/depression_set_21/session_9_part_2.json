  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by discussing your experiences with the reframing skill we practiced last session. Can you share a specific example of a negative thought you noticed and how you went about reframing it?\n\nPatient: Sure. Earlier this week, I had a thought that \"I'm not doing enough to support my family.\" I felt guilty and overwhelmed. When I tried to reframe it, I considered the evidence for and against the thought. The evidence for was that I haven't been able to visit my family as much as I'd like due to work commitments. The evidence against was that I regularly check in with them over the phone and help out financially when I can. I tried to reframe the thought to \"I'm doing my best to support my family given my current circumstances.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of reframing, Priya. You did a good job of considering the evidence for and against the negative thought and coming up with a more balanced perspective. How did you feel after reframing the thought?\n\nPatient: I felt a bit better, less guilty and overwhelmed. But the relief was temporary. The negative thought kept coming back, and I struggled to believe the reframed thought.\n\nTherapist: It's common for negative thoughts to persist, even after reframing them. Our thoughts are often deeply ingrained and tied to our core beliefs. The more we practice reframing and challenging these thoughts, the more natural it will become over time. Let's explore the challenges you faced when trying to believe the reframed thought. What made it difficult for you to fully accept it?\n\nPatient: I think it's because I have this underlying belief that \"I'm not good enough.\" Even when I can see the evidence against my negative thoughts, that core belief keeps pulling me back into self-doubt and criticism.\n\nTherapist: You've identified an important core belief, Priya. These deep-rooted beliefs can make it challenging to fully accept the reframed thoughts. Let's use a technique called the downward arrow to explore this core belief further. I'll ask you a series of questions, and I'd like you to answer them as honestly as possible. If you believed \"I'm not good enough,\" what do you think that would mean about you?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm a failure, that I'm not living up to my potential or meeting the expectations of others.\n\nTherapist: And if that were true, what do you think that would mean about your life?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm destined to be unhappy and unfulfilled, that I don't deserve love and respect from others.\n\nTherapist: I can see how painful that belief is for you, Priya. These core beliefs often develop early in life and can be reinforced by our experiences. The good news is that we can work on reframing these core beliefs, just like we've been doing with your negative thoughts. Let's start by examining the evidence for and against the belief \"I'm not good enough.\"\n\nPatient: I'm not sure how to do that. It feels like there's so much evidence supporting that belief.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel that way, but I encourage you to look at the evidence objectively. Let's start with the evidence against the belief. Can you think of any examples of times when you felt good enough or accomplished something you were proud of?\n\nPatient: Well, I did manage to support my family financially during a difficult time, even though it was challenging. And there have been moments when I've received positive feedback at work, even if I struggled to fully accept it.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples, Priya. You've shown resilience and the ability to support your family, and you've received recognition for your work. Now, let's consider the evidence for the belief \"I'm not good enough.\" What examples come to mind?\n\nPatient: There are times when I feel like I'm not doing enough for my family, like I mentioned earlier. And I often feel like I'm not performing as well as I should be at work, even though I'm putting in a lot of effort.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, Priya. It's important to acknowledge those feelings and experiences. At the same time, I want to point out that feeling like you're not doing enough doesn't necessarily mean you're not good enough. It's possible to be good enough and still have room for growth and improvement. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I can see your point. It's just hard to shake that feeling of not being good enough, even when there's evidence against it.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable, Priya. Reframing core beliefs takes time and practice. I encourage you to continue collecting evidence against the belief \"I'm not good enough\" and to practice self-compassion when those feelings arise. Remember, having room for growth doesn't negate your worth or value as a person.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I'll keep working on reframing that core belief and practicing self-compassion. It's not easy, but I know it's important.\n\nTherapist: You're doing great, Priya. Remember, change takes time, and every step you take towards reframing your thoughts and beliefs is a step towards feeling better. Let's continue to explore this core belief and other negative thoughts as they come up.",
