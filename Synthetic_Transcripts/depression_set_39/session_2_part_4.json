  "transcript": "Patient: I think I'm feeling okay about everything we've discussed so far. It's a lot to take in, but I'm starting to see how my thoughts are connected to my feelings and behaviors. I'm just worried about being able to change these thought patterns, since they've been with me for so long.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel worried about making changes, especially when you've been dealing with depression for a long time. Remember, therapy is a process, and we'll be working together to make these changes gradually. You don't have to do it all at once.\n\nOne thing that can be helpful is to start small and build on your successes over time. For example, this week, you could focus on just noticing when you have negative or self-critical thoughts, without trying to change them right away. This is called \"thought monitoring,\" and it's a great first step in CBT.\n\nPatient: Okay, that seems more manageable. I think I can try to just notice my thoughts without getting too caught up in them.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal! Noticing your thoughts without getting caught up in them is a skill called \"mindfulness.\" It's about observing your thoughts and feelings without judgment, and it can be really helpful in managing depression.\n\nTo help you practice thought monitoring this week, I have a homework assignment for you. I'd like you to keep a thought record, similar to what you did last week, but this time, focus on just noticing and writing down your negative or self-critical thoughts as they occur. Don't worry about challenging them yet - just observe and record. How does that feel for you?\n\nPatient: I think I can do that. It's a bit daunting to think about writing down all my negative thoughts, but I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nTherapist: That's great! Remember, you don't have to catch every single negative thought. Just do your best to notice them when they come up, and write them down when you can. We'll review your thought record together at the beginning of our next session and discuss your experiences with the homework.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. I'll do my best to notice and record my thoughts this week.\n\nTherapist: I have confidence in you, Amir. Remember, this is a process, and every small step counts. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nWe're coming to the end of our session today, so let's take a moment to review what we've discussed. We talked about the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and how cognitive distortions can contribute to depression. We also discussed the importance of setting realistic goals and celebrating small victories in therapy. For homework, you're going to practice thought monitoring by noticing and recording your negative or self-critical thoughts. How are you feeling about our session today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also hopeful.
