  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that comes to mind is when I was working on a project with a tight deadline. I started to feel overwhelmed and had thoughts like, \"I'm not going to be able to finish this on time\" and \"If I don't do this perfectly, my boss will think I'm incompetent.\" I tried to use the coping cards, but I struggled to believe the alternative thoughts in that moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Amir. It's common to have difficulty believing the alternative thoughts when you're feeling overwhelmed and under pressure. In those moments, our negative thoughts can feel very powerful and convincing. One strategy that can be helpful is to take a step back and examine the evidence for and against the negative thoughts. Let's try that now with the thought, \"If I don't do this perfectly, my boss will think I'm incompetent.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I don't have any direct evidence that my boss would think I'm incompetent. It's more of a fear or assumption. But I do know that my boss has high standards and expects quality work.\n\nTherapist: That's an important distinction \u2013 recognizing that it's a fear or assumption rather than a fact. Now, let's look at the evidence against this thought. Have there been times when you haven't been perfect, but your boss didn't think you were incompetent?\n\nPatient: Yeah, there have been a few times when I've made mistakes or didn't meet my own expectations, but my boss was understanding and didn't seem to think poorly of me. In fact, she often reminds us that mistakes are part of the learning process.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the negative thought. It shows that even when you're not perfect, your boss doesn't automatically see you as incompetent. She recognizes that mistakes happen and are part of growth. Another piece of evidence to consider is your overall track record at work. How would you describe your performance and contributions to the company?\n\nPatient: I would say that overall, I'm a strong performer. I consistently meet deadlines, produce quality work, and have received positive feedback from colleagues and clients. I've even been trusted with leading projects and mentoring new team members.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic evidence against the negative thought, Amir. Your track record shows that you're a competent and valued employee, regardless of occasional imperfections. When we look at the evidence objectively, it becomes clearer that the negative thought is not entirely accurate or fair. It's an example of all-or-nothing thinking, where we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms rather than acknowledging the shades of gray.\n\nPatient: I can see that now. It's just hard to remember in the moment when I'm feeling stressed and overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's why practicing this skill is so important. The more you examine the evidence and challenge those negative thoughts, the easier it will become to do so in the moment. Another strategy is to prepare some coping statements in advance, based on the evidence you've gathered. For example, you could write down something like, \"I am a competent and valued employee, even when I'm not perfect. My boss recognizes that mistakes are part of the learning process.\" Having these statements ready can make it easier to challenge the negative thoughts when they arise.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to create some coping statements based on the evidence we've discussed.\n\nTherapist: Great idea, Amir. I think that will be really helpful for you. Remember, challenging negative thoughts is a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. Now, let's shift gears a bit and discuss your progress with the wellness action plan. How has that been going?",
