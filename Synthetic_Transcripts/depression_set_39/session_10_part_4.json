These are important steps in managing your depression and challenging those negative thoughts and beliefs about yourself.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a challenging process, but I feel like I'm starting to make some progress.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. The important thing is that you keep practicing these skills and reaching out for support when you need it.\n\nPatient: I will. I know it's not going to be easy, but I'm committed to working on this.\n\nTherapist: That's great. Before we end our session, let's talk about some homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought records and Positive Data Log, focusing on challenging those negative thoughts and beliefs about yourself. I also encourage you to continue engaging in self-care activities and practicing self-compassion, using the mantra we discussed today.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can do that. I'll try to be more consistent with tracking my thoughts and self-care activities in the log.\n\nTherapist: That's great. Remember, the more you practice these skills, the more natural they will become. If you have any questions or concerns during the week, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Amir. I'm here to support you every step of the way.
