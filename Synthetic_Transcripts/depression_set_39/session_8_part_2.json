  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I had a situation at work this week that really got me down. I made a small mistake on a project, and my boss pointed it out in front of the whole team. I immediately started thinking, \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right. Everyone must think I'm incompetent.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Amir. I can understand how that situation would trigger negative thoughts and emotions. Let's walk through this using a thought record. First, can you rate the intensity of the emotions you felt in that moment, on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I would say I felt about 85 out of 100 in terms of feeling down and discouraged.\n\nTherapist: Okay, now let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm such a failure.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I made a mistake on the project, and my boss called me out on it in front of everyone. That feels like pretty strong evidence that I'm a failure.\n\nTherapist: I can see how that feels like strong evidence in the moment. Now, let's consider the evidence against this thought. Have there been times when you've succeeded at work or received positive feedback?\n\nPatient: When I think about it, I suppose there have been times when I've done well. I recently completed another project that was well-received by the client. And my boss has praised my attention to detail in the past.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought \"I'm such a failure.\" It shows that you've had successes and positive feedback, even if this particular situation felt discouraging. Now, let's look for an alternative thought that takes both the evidence for and against into account. What might be a more balanced way of looking at this situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought might be, \"I made a mistake, but that doesn't mean I'm a complete failure. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and I've had successes in the past.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Amir. It acknowledges the mistake but doesn't overgeneralize it to your entire sense of self-worth. Now, with this alternative thought in mind, how would you rate the intensity of your emotions now?\n\nPatient: I'd say the intensity has gone down to about 50 out of 100. I still feel a bit down, but not as discouraged as before.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, Amir. This is a great example of how challenging negative thoughts can help reduce the intensity of difficult emotions. It takes practice, but over time, it can become a powerful tool for managing depression.\n\nPatient: I can see how that could be helpful. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment when I'm feeling really down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, and it's something many people struggle with. One strategy is to create a coping card with reminders of these techniques and alternative thoughts. You can keep it with you and pull it out when you're feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts. We can work on creating one together if you'd like.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good idea. I think having a physical reminder could be really helpful.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's spend some time now creating a coping card that you can use moving forward. What are some key reminders or alternative thoughts you'd like to include on your card?",
