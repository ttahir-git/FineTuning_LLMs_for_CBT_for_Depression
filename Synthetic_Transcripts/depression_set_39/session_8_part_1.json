  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you again for session 8. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like the thought records and distress tolerance exercises. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and ability to manage stress. However, I still find myself getting caught up in negative thoughts and struggling with motivation.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. Change takes time, and it's normal to face challenges along the way. Today, I'd like to focus on exploring those negative thoughts further and discuss some additional strategies for managing them. We can also touch on motivation and see if we can find ways to support you in that area. How does that sound for our agenda today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'd really like to work on challenging those negative thoughts and finding ways to stay motivated, especially when it comes to self-care and engaging in activities I enjoy.\n\nTherapist: Perfect, let's add self-care and engaging in enjoyable activities to our agenda as well. To start, can you share an example of a negative thought that's been bothering you recently? We can work through it together using a thought record.",
