  "transcript": "Patient: The wellness action plan has been helpful in keeping me accountable and reminding me of the skills I've learned. I've been trying to stick to a consistent sleep schedule and practice relaxation techniques before bed, but it's still a work in progress.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that the wellness action plan has been a helpful tool for you, Amir. Creating a consistent sleep schedule and practicing relaxation techniques are excellent strategies for improving sleep. Remember, it's normal for progress to be gradual, and there may be some setbacks along the way. The key is to keep practicing and not get discouraged if things don't change overnight.\n\nPatient: That's a good reminder. I tend to be hard on myself when I don't see immediate results.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, and it ties back to our discussion about perfectionism. It's important to practice self-compassion and recognize that progress takes time. One way to support this is by setting realistic, achievable goals for yourself. For example, instead of expecting to fall asleep easily every night, you could set a goal to practice relaxation techniques for a certain amount of time before bed, regardless of whether it leads to immediate sleep improvements.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can try setting smaller, more achievable goals for myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Amir. Setting smaller, achievable goals can help you build momentum and feel a sense of accomplishment along the way. It's also important to celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem. Recognizing your progress and giving yourself credit for the efforts you're making can help maintain motivation and counteract perfectionistic thinking.\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be helpful. I often focus on what I'm not doing well, rather than acknowledging my progress.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Amir. It's easy to get caught up in self-criticism and overlook our achievements. One way to shift this is by keeping a \"success log,\" where you write down your accomplishments and positive experiences, no matter how small. This can help you develop a more balanced, realistic view of yourself and your progress.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I think a success log could help me focus more on the positive.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find that idea helpful, Amir. Remember, the goal is not to ignore challenges or difficulties but to develop a more balanced perspective that acknowledges both your strengths and areas for growth. As we discussed earlier, this is a skill that takes practice, so be patient with yourself as you work on developing a more self-compassionate mindset.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best to keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: I have confidence in your ability to continue making progress, Amir. Remember, you've already demonstrated a lot of strength and resilience by engaging in this therapy process and working to make changes in your life. Now, let's discuss any remaining concerns or questions you have about the transition out of regular therapy sessions. How are you feeling about this upcoming change?",
