  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a crisis situation, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service immediately. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and emotions openly through your words. With that said, let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have you noticed any changes in your mood or experiences?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been feeling a bit more stable, but I'm still struggling with negative thoughts and perfectionism, especially at work. I've been trying to use the coping cards we created, but sometimes it's hard to challenge those thoughts in the moment.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been feeling a bit more stable, Amir. It's also understandable that you're still struggling with negative thoughts and perfectionism, particularly in the workplace. Challenging those thoughts can be difficult, especially when you're in the midst of a stressful situation. Let's make sure to discuss some strategies for managing those thoughts at work during our session today. How has your sleep been since our last session?\n\nPatient: My sleep has been slightly better, but I still have nights where I struggle to fall asleep or wake up frequently. It's affecting my energy levels during the day, which makes it harder to focus at work and use my CBT skills effectively.\n\nTherapist: Improving sleep is a process, and it's good to hear that you've noticed some slight improvements. We can definitely explore some additional strategies for managing sleep difficulties and their impact on your daily life. Now, let's take a look at the agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to discuss your experiences with using the coping cards and thought records at work, as well as strategies for managing sleep difficulties. We should also review your progress with the wellness action plan and discuss any remaining concerns you have about the transition out of regular therapy sessions. Does this sound like a good plan for our session today? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I'd also like to discuss how I can continue to challenge my core belief about being worthy of love and respect only if I'm perfect. I feel like that belief is still holding me back in some ways.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Amir. Challenging that core belief is an essential part of your progress, and it's great that you want to continue working on it. We can definitely explore some strategies for doing so during our session today. Let's start by discussing your experiences with using the coping cards and thought records at work. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you found it challenging to use these tools?",
