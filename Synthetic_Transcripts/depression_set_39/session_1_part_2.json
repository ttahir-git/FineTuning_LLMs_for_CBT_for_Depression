  "transcript": "Patient: I've been dealing with these feelings of sadness and hopelessness for as long as I can remember. It's like a constant weight on my shoulders.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like your depression has been a long-standing challenge for you. Can you tell me more about when you first started noticing these feelings?\n\nPatient: I think it started when I was a teenager, around the time my parents got divorced. Everything felt so unstable and uncertain back then.\n\nTherapist: Divorce can be a significant stressor, especially during the formative years of adolescence. How do you think your parents' divorce has impacted your life and your depression?\n\nPatient: It completely changed my family dynamic. I felt like I lost my sense of security and support. I think that's when I started to feel like I had to handle everything on my own.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that such a major change in your family structure would leave you feeling insecure and alone. Those early experiences can shape our beliefs and coping mechanisms. How did you cope with the emotional turmoil during that time?\n\nPatient: I threw myself into my schoolwork and tried to be the perfect child. I thought that if I could just do everything right, maybe things would get better. But it never felt like enough.\n\nTherapist: Perfectionism is a common coping mechanism, but it can also be a double-edged sword. While it might provide a sense of control in the short term, it often leads to feelings of inadequacy and self-criticism in the long run. Has perfectionism continued to play a role in your life?\n\nPatient: Definitely. I've always strived to be the best at everything I do, whether it's work or my hobbies. But lately, I feel like I'm falling short in every aspect of my life.\n\nTherapist: That's a heavy burden to carry, Amir. Perfectionism can be exhausting and can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety. In our work together, we'll explore how these patterns of thinking and behaving might be impacting your mental health and develop strategies to create more balanced and self-compassionate approaches.\n\nPatient: I think I could really benefit from that. I'm just so tired of feeling like I'm never good enough.\n\nTherapist: That's a common feeling among people who struggle with perfectionism and depression. It's important to recognize that your worth is not tied to your achievements or meeting unrealistic standards. As we continue our sessions, we'll work on challenging these negative beliefs and developing a more compassionate and realistic view of yourself.\n\nPatient: I'm looking forward to that. It's been a long time since I've felt good about myself.\n\nTherapist: I'm here to support you in that journey, Amir. Let's continue to explore your experiences and identify the patterns that may be contributing to your depression. Can you tell me more about how your depression has affected your relationships with others?",
