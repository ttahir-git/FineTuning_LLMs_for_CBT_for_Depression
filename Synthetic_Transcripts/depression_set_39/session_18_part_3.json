  "transcript": "Patient: I'd like to create a coping card for situations where I start to feel overwhelmed by my perfectionistic thoughts and the pressure to meet unrealistic standards.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Amir. Let's think about what you'd like the card to say. What's a more balanced, adaptive thought you could use to counteract those perfectionistic beliefs?\n\nPatient: Hmm, maybe something like... \"Striving for excellence is admirable, but perfection is unrealistic and unattainable. I am worthy and capable, even when I make mistakes or fall short of my own high standards.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a powerful statement, Amir. It acknowledges the value of striving for excellence while also recognizing the importance of self-compassion and realistic expectations. Let's write that down on a coping card.\n\n[Coping Card 1]\nFront: \"I'm feeling overwhelmed by perfectionistic thoughts and pressure.\"\nBack: \"Striving for excellence is admirable, but perfection is unrealistic and unattainable. I am worthy and capable, even when I make mistakes or fall short of my own high standards.\"\n\nNow, let's create a few more coping cards based on the other key thoughts and beliefs we've discussed. What's another situation or thought pattern you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: I often struggle with negative self-talk, especially when I'm feeling down or depressed. I could use a coping card to help counteract those thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. What's a more compassionate, realistic thought you could use to challenge that negative self-talk?\n\nPatient: I could remind myself that \"Depression is an illness, not a personal failing. My thoughts and feelings are not always accurate reflections of reality. I am doing my best, and that is enough.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful coping statement, Amir. It shows a great deal of self-awareness and self-compassion. Let's add that to our coping cards.\n\n[Coping Card 2]\nFront: \"I'm engaging in negative self-talk and feeling down on myself.\"\nBack: \"Depression is an illness, not a personal failing. My thoughts and feelings are not always accurate reflections of reality. I am doing my best, and that is enough.\"\n\nWe now have two powerful coping cards that address some of the key challenges you've been facing. Remember, the goal is to use these cards as reminders and tools to help you challenge negative thoughts and reinforce more balanced, adaptive beliefs.\n\nAs we continue through this termination phase of therapy, I want to emphasize the importance of practicing these skills and using these tools independently. You've made tremendous progress in our work together, and I'm confident in your ability to continue this growth on your own.\n\nWhat are your thoughts and feelings about this upcoming transition?",
