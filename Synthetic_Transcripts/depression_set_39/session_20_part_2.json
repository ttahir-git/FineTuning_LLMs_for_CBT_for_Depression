  "transcript": "Patient: Perfectionism shows up at work in a few ways. I often feel like I need to do everything perfectly, and if I don't, I'm letting myself and others down. I spend a lot of time double-checking my work and worrying about making mistakes. Even when I do well, I tend to focus on the things I could have done better.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like perfectionism is causing you a lot of stress and self-criticism at work. Let's explore how this might be impacting your sleep. When you're lying in bed at night, do you find yourself thinking about work or ruminating on things you could have done differently?\n\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I often lie awake thinking about work, going over conversations or tasks in my head. I worry about things I might have missed or how I could have done better. It's hard to shut off those thoughts and relax.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Amir. It seems like the perfectionism and self-criticism during the day are spilling over into your nighttime routine, making it difficult to unwind and fall asleep. This is a common experience for many people who struggle with perfectionism.\n\nOne strategy we can try is using some of the CBT skills you've learned, like thought records and coping statements, to address these perfectionistic thoughts before bed. We can also work on developing a relaxing bedtime routine that helps you shift out of work mode and into a more restful state.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I've been trying to use the thought records and coping cards during the day, but I hadn't thought about using them before bed. What might a relaxing bedtime routine look like?\n\nTherapist: A relaxing bedtime routine might include activities like reading a book, listening to calming music, or doing some gentle stretching or breathing exercises. The key is to choose activities that help you unwind and signal to your body and mind that it's time to sleep.\n\nYou can also incorporate some of the CBT skills you've learned into your bedtime routine. For example, you might spend a few minutes reviewing your thought records from the day and practicing some coping statements related to perfectionism. This can help you address any lingering worries or self-critical thoughts before bed.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of incorporating the CBT skills into my bedtime routine. I think that could be really helpful for managing the perfectionistic thoughts that keep me up at night.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that resonates with you, Amir. Why don't we spend a few minutes now creating a personalized bedtime routine that includes some of these elements? We can also discuss how to use thought records and coping statements specifically for addressing perfectionistic thoughts before bed.\n\nPatient: That sounds great. Let's do that.",
