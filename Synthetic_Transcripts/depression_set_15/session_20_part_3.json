  "transcript": "Patient: Yes, that's exactly right. It's like I get stuck in this negative spiral and can't find my way out.\n\nTherapist: That's a great way to describe it - a negative spiral. And it's a common experience for people with depression. The good news is that we can interrupt that spiral by challenging those negative thoughts. Let's practice with this situation. What would be an alternative, more balanced thought?\n\nPatient: Hmm, well I guess an alternative thought could be \"Everyone struggles with deadlines sometimes. One project doesn't define my worth.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent alternative thought! It acknowledges the struggle, but doesn't jump to extreme conclusions about your worth. How do you think your feelings and behaviors might have been different if you had been able to access that thought in the moment?\n\nPatient: I probably would have felt less overwhelmed and hopeless. And I might have been able to face going into work the next day, instead of avoiding it.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Challenging those negative thoughts can have a big impact on our feelings and behaviors. And the more we practice, the easier it gets to access those alternative thoughts in the moment. I'm wondering if we could create a coping card for this situation. What might you write on it as a reminder for next time?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like \"Deadlines are challenging, but they don't define me. I can ask for help if I need it.\"\n\nTherapist: I love that! It validates the challenge, but also reminds you of your options and your worth beyond the situation. Would you be willing to write that down on a card or in your phone to refer back to?\n\nPatient: Yes, I can definitely do that. I like the idea of having a concrete reminder.\n\nTherapist: Great! Coping cards can be a really helpful tool for interrupting those negative spirals. And the more you practice using them, the more automatic those alternative thoughts will become.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'm realizing how much power those thoughts have over my mood and behavior.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right. Our thoughts have a big influence on how we feel and what we do. That's a key concept in CBT - the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. By changing our thoughts, we can change the whole cycle.\n\nPatient: It's a lot to keep track of, but I'm starting to see how it all fits together.\n\nTherapist: It can definitely feel overwhelming at first. But you're doing an amazing job of breaking it down and practicing these skills. And the more you practice, the more natural it will feel.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I'm really grateful for your support and guidance through this process.\n\nTherapist: It's my pleasure, Emilio. I'm so proud of the progress you've made and the insights you're gaining. Remember, this is a skill like any other - it takes practice and patience. But you're well on your way to becoming your own therapist!\n\nPatient: That's a nice way to think about it. I'm building a toolkit that I can use even after our sessions are done.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! You're developing a set of skills and strategies that you can use for the rest of your life. And that's a powerful thing. Speaking of which, I'm curious how you've been feeling about our sessions coming to an end soon.",
