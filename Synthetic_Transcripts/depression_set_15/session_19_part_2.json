  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for session 19 of CBT for depression with patient Emilio Gomez:\n\nPatient: I've been trying to use the thought records more consistently, but it's still a challenge to remember to do them in the moment when I'm feeling really down on myself. I find myself getting caught up in the negative thoughts before I even realize what's happening.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common challenge, Emilio. It takes practice to catch those negative thoughts in the moment and pause to reframe them. One strategy that can help is to set aside a specific time each day to reflect on your thoughts and complete a thought record. That way, even if you don't catch the thoughts in the moment, you can still process them later. What do you think about trying that?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I think setting aside a specific time could help me be more consistent with it. I could try doing it in the evenings after work, maybe right before I start winding down for bed.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. Doing thought records in the evening can be really helpful for processing the day and identifying any patterns in your thinking. And it's great that you're planning to do it before bed - that can help you go to sleep with a clearer mind. \n\nPatient: Yeah, I definitely notice that my sleep is worse when I'm stuck in negative thought loops. I'm hoping that doing the thought records will help with that too.\n\nTherapist: It certainly can. Our thoughts have a big impact on our physical wellbeing, including sleep. By reframing some of those negative thoughts before bed, you may find that you're able to fall asleep more easily and sleep more soundly. \n\nPatient: That would be amazing. I feel like I haven't had a truly restful night of sleep in so long.\n\nTherapist: I hear you. Sleep troubles are so common with depression, and they can really take a toll. In addition to the thought records, there are other sleep hygiene strategies we can discuss if you'd find that helpful. But for now, let's focus on the thought records and self-critical thoughts. You mentioned that you've been noticing a lot of self-critical thoughts lately. Can you give me an example of one that's been coming up frequently?\n\nPatient: Well, one that comes up a lot at work is \"I'm not good enough.\" Like when I'm working on a project and I feel like I'm not doing it as well or as quickly as I should be. I start thinking that everyone else is doing better than me and that I'm going to get fired.\n\nTherapist: Those types of thoughts can be so painful and distressing. And it sounds like they're really impacting your work life and your overall wellbeing. When you notice yourself having those thoughts, what emotions come up for you?\n\nPatient: I feel really anxious and down on myself. Sometimes I feel hopeless, like I'm never going to be good enough no matter how hard I try. And then I feel guilty for not being able to do better.\n\nTherapist: That's a lot of difficult emotions to deal with. Anxiety, hopelessness, guilt - those are all really heavy feelings. And it makes sense that you'd feel that way if you're having thoughts like \"I'm not good enough.\" Our thoughts have a big influence on our emotions. Can you remember a specific situation recently where you had that thought \"I'm not good enough\"?\n\nPatient: Yeah, it happened just last week. I was working on a big project with a tight deadline and I was struggling to get it done. I kept thinking that everyone else on my team was probably doing better than me and that I was holding everyone back. I ended up staying late at work every night trying to catch up, but I still felt like I was failing.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a really tough situation. Let's break it down using the CBT triangle. The situation was that you were working on a big project with a tight deadline. The thoughts you noticed were \"I'm not good enough\" and \"Everyone else is doing better than me.\" And the emotions that came up were anxiety, hopelessness, and guilt. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's exactly it. And then the behavior was staying late at work every night trying to catch up, but still feeling like I was failing.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. So we can see how the situation, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are all connected. The situation triggered those self-critical thoughts, which led to difficult emotions, which then influenced your behavior. And the behavior of staying late at work every night likely reinforced those self-critical thoughts and difficult emotions. It can become a vicious cycle.",
