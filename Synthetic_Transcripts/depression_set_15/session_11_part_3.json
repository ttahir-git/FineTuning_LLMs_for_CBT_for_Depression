  "transcript": "Patient: I can try to practice the positive self-talk this week. It's not going to be easy, but I see how it could help me be less hard on myself.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you're willing to give it a try. Remember, it's okay if it feels challenging at first. Like any new skill, it takes practice to build that muscle of self-compassion. \n\nAnother thing we can do to help shift those core beliefs is to look for evidence that contradicts them. For example, you mentioned that you have this belief that you're not trying hard enough or that you're weak for not being able to do everything you want to do. Let's look for some evidence against that belief. Can you think of any times recently where you did push yourself, even if it was in a small way?\n\nPatient: I guess there was one day last week where I really didn't want to get out of bed, but I made myself do it anyway because I had a therapy appointment. And I've been trying to do the homework you've given me, even though it's been hard.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples! Getting out of bed when you're feeling depressed can be a huge accomplishment, and the fact that you've been trying to do your homework shows that you are putting in effort, even if it doesn't always feel like enough. Those are pieces of evidence against the belief that you're not trying hard enough or that you're weak.\n\nAs we continue to work together, we can keep looking for more evidence like that to help challenge those negative core beliefs. It's kind of like building a case against that inner critic that's always putting you down.\n\nPatient: I like that idea of building a case against my inner critic. It makes it feel more manageable, like I'm gathering evidence instead of just trying to shut it up.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! And the more evidence you gather, the stronger your case becomes. It's not about getting rid of that inner critic completely - everyone has one to some extent. It's about learning to recognize when it's being unreasonable and having the tools to challenge it.\n\nAnother thing that can be helpful in shifting those core beliefs is to practice acting in ways that are opposite to what the belief tells you. For example, if the belief is \"I'm not good enough,\" you could practice doing things that make you feel competent or proud of yourself, even if it's something small. Or if the belief is \"I'm weak,\" you could practice doing things that make you feel strong or capable.\n\nWhat do you think about trying to practice some opposite action this week? We could come up with a small goal related to one of those beliefs you want to work on.",
