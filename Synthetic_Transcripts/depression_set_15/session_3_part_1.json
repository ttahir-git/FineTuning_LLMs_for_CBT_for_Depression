  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for our third session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to start by acknowledging that as an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. However, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities within these limitations. \n\nBefore we dive in, I want to review the homework we discussed last time. How did you find the process of monitoring your thoughts and challenging cognitive distortions over the past week?\n\nPatient: It was challenging at times, but I did notice some progress. I caught myself falling into all-or-nothing thinking a few times, and I tried to look for evidence and consider what I would say to a friend in those situations. It helped a bit, but I still find it hard to break out of those negative thought patterns sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Emilio. Challenging long-standing thought patterns is a process, and it's normal to experience some difficulty along the way. The fact that you were able to catch yourself in those moments and try to apply the techniques we discussed is a significant step forward. We'll continue working on strengthening those skills.\n\nFor today's session, I'd like to propose the following agenda:\n\n1. Review your homework in more detail and discuss any challenges or insights that arose.\n2. Finalize our CBT conceptualization of your depression, building on what we've discussed so far.\n3. Begin setting specific, measurable goals for your therapy journey.\n\nHow does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?",
