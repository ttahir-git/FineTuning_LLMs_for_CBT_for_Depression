  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying to use the thought records when I notice those self-critical thoughts coming up, but sometimes it's hard to catch them in the moment, especially when I'm around other people. I feel like I get stuck in my own head and can't really focus on challenging the thoughts until later.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Emilio. It's common to struggle with catching thoughts in the moment, especially in social situations. It takes practice to build that skill. One strategy that can be helpful is to set aside a specific time each day to reflect on your thoughts and complete the thought records. That way, you're not putting pressure on yourself to do it in the moment, but you're still making time to challenge those self-critical thoughts. What do you think about trying that?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I think setting aside a specific time would make it feel more manageable. I could try doing it in the evenings after work, when I have some quiet time to myself.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. Even just 10-15 minutes of dedicated reflection time can make a big difference. And as you practice, it will start to feel more natural to catch those thoughts in the moment. Another strategy that can be helpful in social situations is to have some go-to phrases or mantras that you can repeat to yourself when you notice self-critical thoughts coming up. For example, you could try saying something like, \"I'm doing my best, and that's enough\" or \"Everyone makes mistakes sometimes; it doesn't mean I'm not valuable.\" The key is to find phrases that feel authentic and meaningful to you. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: I really like the idea of having some go-to phrases. I think that could help me shift my focus in the moment, even if I can't do a full thought record right then. I'll have to think about what phrases would feel most helpful for me.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, it's all about finding what works for you. And you can always experiment with different phrases and see what feels most effective. Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate self-critical thoughts completely\u2014that's not realistic for anyone. The goal is to notice them, acknowledge them without judgment, and then redirect your focus to more balanced and compassionate thoughts. It's a process of building new mental habits, and that takes time and practice. How are you feeling about all of this?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also hopeful. It's good to know that it's okay if I don't always get it right, and that it's a process. I think I just need to keep practicing and be patient with myself.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed at times. Learning new skills and challenging long-standing thought patterns is hard work, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Remember to give yourself credit for the progress you've already made. You've been showing up for yourself in a big way, and that's something to be proud of. As we continue working together, we'll keep exploring strategies for managing self-critical thoughts and building self-compassion. And we'll make sure to go at a pace that feels manageable for you. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds really good. I appreciate you reminding me to give myself credit for the progress I've made. It's easy for me to focus on what I'm not doing well, but I know I have made some positive changes. I feel more aware of my thoughts and how they impact me, and I'm starting to see how I can shift them in a more positive direction.",
