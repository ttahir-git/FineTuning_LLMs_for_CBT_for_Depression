  "transcript": "Patient: I think I'd like to talk more about managing the low energy and motivation, and maybe some strategies for getting myself to do things even when I don't feel up to it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, and it's something we can definitely work on together. Before we dive into that, let's take a moment to review how the thought records and grounding techniques have been going since our last session. Have you been able to practice those at all?\n\nPatient: I've been trying, but it's been hard to stay consistent with them. I find that when I'm feeling really low, it's tough to even remember to pull out the thought record or try the grounding techniques.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common challenge, and it's something we can problem-solve together. Let's start by looking at the thought records. Can you walk me through an example of a time when you tried to use one, and what got in the way?\n\nPatient: Well, there was one day when I was feeling particularly down and hopeless. I tried to start a thought record, but I just kept getting stuck on the \"evidence for\" column. All I could think about were reasons why my negative thoughts were true.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, and it highlights how powerful those negative thoughts can be. When we're feeling low, it can be hard to see any evidence to the contrary. That's where the \"evidence against\" column comes in. Let's take one of those negative thoughts and see if we can brainstorm some evidence against it together.\n\nPatient: Okay, one thought that keeps coming up is \"I'm never going to get better.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a really tough thought to sit with. Let's look at the evidence against that thought. What would you say to someone else who was struggling with depression and expressed that same thought?\n\nPatient: I guess I would remind them that recovery is a process, and it's not always a straight line. Just because they're having a bad day or a bad week doesn't mean they're not making progress overall.\n\nTherapist: That's a really compassionate and wise response. Can you see how that same logic might apply to your own situation?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess that's true. It's just hard to remember that in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's why practicing these skills regularly can be so helpful. The more you do it, the more automatic it becomes. Another strategy that can be helpful for managing low motivation is something called \"behavioral activation.\" Basically, it involves scheduling activities that give you a sense of accomplishment or pleasure, even if you don't feel like doing them at first. What do you think about giving that a try?\n\nPatient: I'm willing to give it a shot. It's just hard to think of activities that I actually enjoy these days.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge with depression. Let's start small and see if we can come up with a few ideas together. What are some things you used to enjoy, or that you think you might enjoy if you gave them a chance?",
