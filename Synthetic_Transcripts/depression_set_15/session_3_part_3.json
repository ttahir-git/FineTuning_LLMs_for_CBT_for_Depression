  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that comes to mind is when I was trying to work on a project last weekend, and I just couldn't focus. I kept getting distracted and felt like I wasn't making any progress. I started thinking \"I'm never going to finish this\" and \"I'm going to let everyone down.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to work with. Let's break it down using the thought recording process. The situation is that you were trying to work on a project and had trouble focusing. The emotions you experienced were frustration and hopelessness. The thoughts behind those emotions were \"I'm never going to finish this\" and \"I'm going to let everyone down.\"\n\nNow, let's rate how much you believed those thoughts on a scale of 0-100. What would you say?\n\nPatient: In the moment, I probably would have rated them both at around 90.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you were feeling quite strongly that those thoughts were true. Now let's look for evidence. What evidence do you have that you'll never finish the project?\n\nPatient: Well, I was struggling to focus and wasn't making much progress. I felt like I was wasting time.\n\nTherapist: That's valid evidence for the thought. What about evidence against the thought? Have you ever struggled with a project before and still managed to complete it?\n\nPatient: Yeah, actually, there have been several projects where I felt stuck at first but eventually figured it out and got it done.\n\nTherapist: So there's evidence that even when you struggle, you're capable of pushing through and finishing projects. What about the thought \"I'm going to let everyone down\"? What evidence do you have for that?\n\nPatient: I guess I was assuming that because I was struggling, I wouldn't be able to deliver on what I had promised.\n\nTherapist: And what about evidence against that thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've never actually missed a deadline or failed to deliver on a project, even if I had to push through some challenges.\n\nTherapist: So the evidence suggests that even when you face difficulties, you still follow through on your commitments. Now, based on the evidence, what might be a more balanced thought?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like \"I'm struggling with this project right now, but I've overcome challenges before, and I can do it again.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges the difficulty you're experiencing while also recognizing your past successes and capability to overcome challenges. Now, if you were to re-rate how much you believe the original thoughts, what would you say?\n\nPatient: I'd probably rate them lower, maybe around 50 or 60. I can see that there's evidence against them, even though the feelings are still there.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, and it shows how examining the evidence can help to weaken the hold of negative thoughts. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the more automatic it becomes.\n\nNow, let's talk a bit more about your goals for therapy. We've discussed building assertiveness skills and developing healthier coping strategies. Another area you mentioned wanting to work on is improving relationships. What might be a specific goal related to that?\n\nPatient: I'd like to work on opening up more to the people close to me, like my family and friends. I tend to bottle things up and not share what I'm going through.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal. Building closer connections and being vulnerable with trusted loved ones can be really powerful in combating depression. A specific goal related to that might be something like \"Share something vulnerable or emotionally meaningful with a trusted friend or family member at least once per week.\" How does that sound?\n\nPatient: It sounds scary, but I know it would be good for me. I think having a specific goal like that could help me push myself to open up more.\n\nTherapist: It can definitely be scary to make ourselves vulnerable, but you're right that it can be so beneficial for our mental health and relationships. We can work on building up to that gradually, and I'll be here to support you through the process.\n\nAnother goal we discussed was developing healthier coping strategies. You mentioned trying a new coping strategy, like journaling or deep breathing, at least three times per week. That's a great place to start. We can also work on identifying your triggers for self-harm and developing a plan for how to cope when those urges arise.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about the therapy process so far? I want to make sure we're on the same page and that you feel comfortable with the plan we're developing.\n\nPatient: I don't think I have any specific questions right now. I appreciate you breaking everything down and explaining the process. It helps me feel more at ease about what to expect.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. I want you to always feel comfortable asking questions or raising concerns if they come up. This is a collaborative process, and your input is invaluable.\n\nBased on our discussion today, it sounds like our main goals for therapy are:\n\n1. Build assertiveness skills, with a specific goal of practicing saying \"no\" to a request at work at least once per week.\n2. Develop healthier coping strategies, with a specific goal of trying a new coping strategy like journaling or deep breathing at least three times per week.\n3. Improve relationships by opening up more, with a specific goal of sharing something vulnerable or emotionally meaningful with a trusted friend or family member at least once per week.\n\nWe'll also continue working on catching and challenging cognitive distortions using thought records. Does this plan feel manageable and aligned with your goals?",
