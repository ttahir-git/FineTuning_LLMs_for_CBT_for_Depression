  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's dive deeper into the behavioral experiment. You mentioned feeling nervous before the meeting and experiencing self-doubt. Can you walk me through the thoughts that were going through your mind in that moment?\n\nPatient: I kept thinking, \"I'm not good enough\" and \"My ideas are never valuable.\" It felt like everyone would judge me or think I'm stupid.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound really distressing. Let's examine them more closely. When you say, \"I'm not good enough,\" what do you think that means about you?\n\nPatient: It means I'm inadequate, like I can't measure up to others' expectations or my own.\n\nTherapist: And what about the thought, \"My ideas are never valuable\"? What does that mean to you?\n\nPatient: It means I don't contribute anything worthwhile, like I'm just taking up space.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like these thoughts are connected to some deeper beliefs about yourself. This is something we call the \"downward arrow\" technique, where we keep asking ourselves what a thought means until we get to the core belief underneath. In this case, it seems like the core belief might be something like, \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I'm not valuable.\" Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that's right. It's hard to shake those beliefs, even when there's evidence against them.\n\nTherapist: You're right, core beliefs can be really stubborn. But the good news is that we can work on reframing them over time. One way to do that is by collecting evidence that contradicts the negative belief. In this case, what evidence do you have that your ideas are valuable and that you are good enough?\n\nPatient: Well, like I said, my colleagues did respond positively to my idea in the meeting. And I've had other successes at work before, even if I don't always recognize them.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence! Let's write that down in a thought record. In the first column, we'll put the situation: sharing an idea in a team meeting. In the second column, we'll put the emotions you felt: anxiety and self-doubt. In the third column, we'll put the negative thoughts: \"I'm not good enough\" and \"My ideas are never valuable.\" In the fourth column, we'll put the evidence against those thoughts: your colleagues' positive response and your past successes at work. And in the fifth column, we'll put an alternative thought: \"I have valuable ideas to contribute, even if I don't always believe it.\" How does that sound?\n\nPatient: It sounds good. It's helpful to see it all laid out like that.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad it's helpful. The more we practice this, the easier it will get to challenge those negative thoughts and beliefs. And over time, it can help shift those core beliefs to be more balanced and realistic.",
