  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the skills we discussed, like challenging negative thoughts and using my coping card. It's been challenging at times, especially when I'm feeling really down, but I've noticed some small improvements in my ability to manage those moments of hopelessness.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've discussed, even though it's been challenging at times. Small improvements are still progress, and it's important to acknowledge and celebrate those victories. Can you tell me more about how you've been using the coping card and what you've noticed when you challenge your negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: When I'm feeling really hopeless, I try to pull out my coping card and read through the reminders and strategies we came up with. It helps me ground myself a bit and remember that those feelings will pass. When I challenge my negative thoughts, I've noticed that it helps me see things from a different perspective. It doesn't always make the thoughts go away completely, but it does take some of the power out of them.\n\nTherapist: Using your coping card to ground yourself and challenge negative thoughts is a great way to manage those difficult moments. It's okay if the thoughts don't disappear completely \u2013 the goal is to lessen their impact and help you see things from a different angle. I'm glad you've been able to notice some changes in how you're responding to those thoughts and feelings.\n\nFor today's session, I thought we could start by reviewing your progress on the homework we discussed last time, and then explore any new insights or challenges that have come up. We can also continue building on the skills and strategies we've been working on, like cognitive restructuring and self-care. I'd also like to introduce the concept of core beliefs and start exploring how they might be contributing to your negative thought patterns. How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm curious to learn more about core beliefs and how they might be impacting my thoughts. One thing I wanted to add to the agenda is talking about how I can start to increase my social engagement a bit more. I've been feeling really isolated lately, and I know that's not helping my depression.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss strategies for increasing social engagement and exploring how that might help with your depression. It's a great goal to work towards, and we can come up with some small steps you can take to start connecting with others more. Let's start by reviewing your homework from last session \u2013 how did it go with practicing thought records and scheduling self-care activities?",
