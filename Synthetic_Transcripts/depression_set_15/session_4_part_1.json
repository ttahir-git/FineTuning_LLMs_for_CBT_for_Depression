  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for our fourth session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or interpretations. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week, to be honest. I've been trying to work on the thought records and coping strategies we discussed, but it's been difficult to stay consistent. I'm still struggling with feelings of worthlessness and guilt, especially at work.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Emilio. It's common to face challenges when implementing new skills and techniques. Let's explore what specific difficulties you encountered with the thought records and coping strategies. Before we do that, I'd like to set an agenda for today's session to ensure we cover the most important topics. What would you like to prioritize in our time together today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on the challenges I faced with the homework, especially the thought records. I also want to discuss how my depression is impacting my work life and relationships. And maybe we could talk about some additional coping strategies I can try.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a productive plan. Let's start by discussing the challenges you faced with the thought records and homework. Then, we can explore how your depression is affecting your work and relationships. We'll also brainstorm some additional coping strategies that you can implement. As we work through these topics, we'll keep an eye on how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. How does that sound?",
