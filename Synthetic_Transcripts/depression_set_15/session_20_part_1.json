  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I strive to provide evidence-based support, I don't have real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a chance I could generate inaccurate information at times. And while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or trusted support person. With that said, how have you been since our last session? I'm eager to hear about your progress and experiences over the past week.\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand and appreciate you sharing those limitations. It's been an up and down week for me. I've been trying to practice the thought records and coping statements we discussed, but it's still challenging to catch those self-critical thoughts in the moment. I did reach out to my friend from the support group, which felt good to connect. But work has been stressful and I've been struggling with motivation. I'm hoping we can talk more about strategies for dealing with work stress today.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you reached out to your friend - that's a positive step in building your support network. Work stress is a common challenge, and I'm glad you brought it up as something you'd like to focus on today. Before we set our agenda, let me check in a bit more. You mentioned feeling up and down, and struggling with motivation. Can you tell me more about how your mood has been, and if anything specific triggered those dips in motivation?",
