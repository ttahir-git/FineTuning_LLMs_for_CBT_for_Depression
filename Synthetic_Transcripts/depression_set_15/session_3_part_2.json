  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I don't have anything else to add right now.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's dive in then. You mentioned that you noticed some progress with catching all-or-nothing thinking and trying to challenge those thoughts. Can you share an example of a situation where you were able to do that?\n\nPatient: Yeah, last week at work, I made a small mistake on a project. Normally, I would spiral into thinking that I'm a complete failure and that I can't do anything right. But this time, I tried to stop myself and look at the evidence. I reminded myself that everyone makes mistakes sometimes and that one mistake doesn't define me or my abilities.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example of catching and challenging a cognitive distortion in the moment. You did a great job of looking for evidence and reframing the situation in a more balanced way. How did that impact your emotional state compared to how you might have felt if you hadn't challenged the thought?\n\nPatient: I still felt frustrated with myself, but it didn't spiral into the same level of self-loathing and hopelessness that it usually would. I was able to move on from the mistake more quickly and focus on fixing it rather than getting stuck in negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, and it's great that you were able to notice the difference in your emotional state. Being able to catch those thoughts, challenge them, and then observe the impact on your feelings and behavior is a key part of CBT.\n\nNow, let's talk a bit more about your goals for therapy. Last session, we discussed some general areas you'd like to work on, like improving relationships and developing healthier coping strategies. I'd like to help you break those down into more specific, measurable goals. For example, instead of a general goal like \"improve relationships,\" we might set a goal like \"initiate one social interaction per week.\" This gives us a clear target to work towards and a way to track progress. What are your thoughts on that?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of having more specific goals. It makes it feel more achievable. One thing I'd like to work on is being more assertive in my relationships, especially at work. I often find myself agreeing to take on more than I can handle because I don't want to disappoint anyone.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal. We can definitely work on building assertiveness skills. A specific goal related to that might be something like \"Practice saying 'no' to a request at work at least once per week.\" We can start small and build up from there. Another goal we discussed was developing healthier coping strategies. What might be a specific goal related to that?\n\nPatient: I'd like to work on using healthier coping strategies when I'm feeling overwhelmed or stressed, instead of turning to self-harm. Maybe a goal could be to try a new coping strategy, like journaling or deep breathing, at least three times per week.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic goal. Trying out new coping strategies and gradually replacing self-harm with healthier alternatives is a key part of the process. We'll work on building your toolbox of coping skills over the course of our sessions.\n\nNow, I'd like to introduce a basic CBT technique that we'll be using throughout our work together. It's called thought recording. The idea is to capture negative thoughts as they occur, and then challenge them by examining the evidence and considering alternative perspectives. This helps to break the cycle of negative thinking and build more balanced, realistic thoughts.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. When you notice a strong negative emotion, take a moment to identify the thought behind it. Write down the situation, the emotion, and the thought.\n\n2. Next, rate how much you believe the thought on a scale of 0-100.\n\n3. Then, look for evidence that supports or refutes the thought. Write down the evidence.\n\n4. Consider an alternative, more balanced thought based on the evidence. Write that down as well.\n\n5. Finally, re-rate how much you believe the original thought.\n\nThis process helps to slow down the negative thought cycle and engage your rational mind. It takes practice, but over time, it can help to shift your thinking patterns in a more positive direction.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this technique? Does it seem like something you'd be willing to try?\n\nPatient: It makes sense, and I'm willing to give it a try. I like that it breaks it down into clear steps. I think I might have trouble coming up with alternative thoughts sometimes, but I'm open to practicing.\n\nTherapist: That's great. It's normal to have some difficulty coming up with alternative thoughts at first. That's something we can work on together. To start, you might try imagining what you would say to a friend in the same situation, or thinking about how you might view the situation on a good day when you're not feeling as low.\n\nWhy don't we practice with an example? Can you think of a situation from the past week where you had a strong negative emotion and might have benefited from thought recording?",
