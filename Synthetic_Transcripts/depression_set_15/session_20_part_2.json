  "transcript": "Patient: Thanks for checking in, Nova. My mood has been pretty low at times, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed with work deadlines. I start thinking that I'm not capable of handling the pressure and that I'm going to disappoint everyone. It's hard to find the energy to do anything when I'm in that headspace.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like those self-critical thoughts are really taking a toll on your mood and motivation. That's a common pattern in depression - when we're feeling down, it's easier for those negative thoughts to take over. But I'm glad you're able to recognize that pattern.

I started falling behind and my manager asked for an update. I immediately thought \"I'm such a failure, I can't even handle a simple project. My manager must think I'm incompetent.\" I ended up calling in sick the next day because I couldn't face going in.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, and I appreciate you sharing it with me. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle. The situation was falling behind on a project and your manager asking for an update. The thoughts were \"I'm a failure\" and \"My manager thinks I'm incompetent.\" And the behaviors were avoiding work and calling in sick. Does that sound right?",
