  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you also wanted to discuss your sleep and the nightmares you've been having related to your military service. Can you tell me more about what's been happening with your sleep lately?\n\nPatient: It's been tough. I've been having nightmares almost every night, and they feel so real. I wake up feeling exhausted and on edge, like I can't shake the feelings from the dream.\n\nTherapist: Nightmares can be incredibly distressing, and it's not surprising that they're affecting your energy and mood during the day. Let's explore this further. When you wake up from a nightmare, what thoughts go through your mind?\n\nPatient: I often think, \"I'm never going to be free of this\" or \"I'm broken because I can't move on from what happened.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound really painful. Let's look at them more closely. The thought \"I'm never going to be free of this\" sounds like a prediction about the future. What evidence do you have that this thought is true?\n\nPatient: I guess I don't have any concrete evidence. It just feels like it will never end because the nightmares keep happening.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point. The nightmares are happening now, but that doesn't necessarily mean they'll continue forever. In fact, there are treatments that can help reduce the frequency and intensity of nightmares related to trauma. The thought \"I'm broken because I can't move on from what happened\" also jumps out at me. This sounds like a judgment about yourself based on your experience with trauma. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I guess it's not fair to call myself broken. I've been through a lot, and it makes sense that I'm still affected by it.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Experiencing trauma doesn't mean you're broken. It means you're human, and you're having a normal reaction to an abnormal situation. Let's see if we can reframe those thoughts in a more balanced way. What's an alternative thought to \"I'm never going to be free of this\"?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"The nightmares are happening now, but that doesn't mean they'll last forever. There are treatments that can help.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges the current struggle while also recognizing the possibility for change. And what about an alternative to \"I'm broken because I can't move on from what happened\"?\n\nPatient: Maybe, \"I'm not broken. I'm having a normal reaction to a traumatic experience, and it's okay to take time to heal.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a really powerful reframe. It shows self-compassion and understanding. Let's write these down in a thought record, just like we did with the thoughts about the meeting. We can also discuss some coping strategies for managing the nightmares, like grounding techniques or imagery rehearsal therapy. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: It sounds really helpful. I'm willing to try anything that might help me sleep better.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Before we dive into those strategies, let's check in. How are you feeling after discussing the nightmares and reframing those thoughts?\n\nPatient: I feel a little lighter, like I have some hope that things can get better. It's still scary to think about the nightmares, but I feel like I have some tools to deal with them now.",
