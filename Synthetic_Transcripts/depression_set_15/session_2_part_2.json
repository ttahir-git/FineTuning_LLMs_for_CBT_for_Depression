  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that comes to mind is when I was at work earlier this week. I made a small mistake on a project, and my supervisor pointed it out in front of my colleagues. I immediately felt overwhelmed with shame and anxiety.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Emilio. Let's break down the situation using the CBT framework. The triggering event was your supervisor pointing out your mistake in front of your colleagues. The emotions you experienced were shame and anxiety. What thoughts went through your mind in that moment?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right. Everyone must think I'm incompetent.\"\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing those thoughts, Emilio. In CBT, we call these types of thoughts \"cognitive distortions.\" They're inaccurate or exaggerated thoughts that can contribute to negative emotions. In this case, it sounds like you engaged in \"all-or-nothing thinking\" by believing you can't do anything right because of one mistake. Another distortion present is \"mind reading,\" where you assume your colleagues think you're incompetent without any concrete evidence.\n\nPatient: I can see how those thoughts are distorted when you point them out like that. But in the moment, they feel so real and overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience, Emilio. These distortions can be deeply ingrained and feel very convincing. The good news is that with practice, we can learn to identify and challenge these thoughts, which can help reduce their emotional impact.\n\nLet's try challenging one of those thoughts now. When you think, \"I'm such a failure,\" what evidence do you have that supports or refutes that belief?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose there's evidence that I'm not a complete failure. I've had successes at work before, and I've received positive feedback from colleagues and supervisors in the past. But in the moment, it's hard to remember that.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Emilio. When we're emotional, it can be difficult to access rational counter-evidence. That's why practicing this skill when we're not in the midst of strong emotions is so important. With time, it becomes easier to challenge distorted thoughts in the moment.\n\nAnother technique we can use is to consider what we'd say to a friend in a similar situation. If a friend came to you and said, \"I made a mistake at work, so I'm a failure,\" how would you respond?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and it doesn't mean they're a failure. I'd remind them of their strengths and accomplishments.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And the same compassion and understanding you'd extend to a friend is what you deserve to give yourself. This is the essence of self-compassion, which is another important aspect of CBT.\n\nAs we continue our work together, we'll practice identifying cognitive distortions, challenging them with evidence, and treating ourselves with compassion. These skills take time to develop, but with practice, they can make a significant difference in how we think and feel.\n\nHow are you feeling about what we've discussed so far? Do you have any questions or thoughts you'd like to share?",
