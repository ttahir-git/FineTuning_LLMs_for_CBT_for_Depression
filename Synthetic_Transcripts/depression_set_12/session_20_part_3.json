  "transcript": "Patient: That makes sense. I guess I just find it hard to be kind to myself when I feel like I'm messing up. It's easier to be compassionate towards others.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Jamie. Many people find it easier to extend compassion to others than to themselves. But self-compassion is a skill that can be developed with practice.\n\nOne way to start is by noticing when you're having self-critical thoughts and consciously shifting to a more understanding and supportive inner dialogue. For example, instead of saying \"I'm so lazy for not going to yoga today,\" you could say \"I'm feeling tired and overwhelmed today, and that's okay. I'll try again tomorrow.\"\n\nAnother helpful technique is to imagine what you would say to a good friend who was in your situation. Chances are, you would offer them kindness and support rather than criticism. Try extending that same compassion to yourself.\n\nPatient: I like that idea of imagining what I would say to a friend. That makes it feel more natural, I think.\n\nTherapist: Great! That's a wonderful insight. Practicing self-compassion can feel awkward or difficult at first, but it becomes more natural over time. And it can make a big difference in how you feel and how you relate to yourself.\n\nAnother aspect of self-compassion is recognizing that everyone struggles and makes mistakes. It's part of being human. When you're having a hard time, remind yourself that you're not alone in that experience. Everyone faces challenges and setbacks.\n\nPatient: That's true. I guess I sometimes feel like I'm the only one who struggles with this stuff, but I know that's not true.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And reminding yourself of that common humanity can help you be more understanding and patient with yourself.\n\nI'd like to do a thought record with you now, focusing on a time recently when you struggled with self-criticism. Can you think of a situation that triggered those kinds of thoughts?\n\nPatient: Yeah, actually. The other day, I was supposed to meet a friend for lunch, but I was feeling really down and ended up canceling at the last minute. I felt terrible about it and kept thinking \"I'm such a bad friend\" and \"I'm always letting people down.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's use that situation for our thought record. Remember, the first step is to identify the situation and the emotions that came up for you. It sounds like the situation was canceling lunch with your friend, and the emotions were guilt and sadness. Is that right?\n\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. I felt really guilty for canceling and sad that I missed out on seeing my friend.\n\nTherapist: Good. Now let's identify the automatic thoughts that went through your mind in that situation. You mentioned \"I'm such a bad friend\" and \"I'm always letting people down.\" Were there any other thoughts?\n\nPatient: I also thought \"My friend must be so annoyed with me\" and \"I'm never going to have close friendships if I keep doing this.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have four automatic thoughts:\n1. \"I'm such a bad friend.\"\n2. \"I'm always letting people down.\"\n3. \"My friend must be so annoyed with me.\"\n4. \"I'm never going to have close friendships if I keep doing this.\"\n\nNow let's look at each of these thoughts and see if we can find any evidence that supports or refutes them. Let's start with the first one: \"I'm such a bad friend.\" What evidence do you have that this thought is true?",
