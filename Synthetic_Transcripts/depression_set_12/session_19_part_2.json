  "transcript": "Patient: I'm glad we're going to discuss how to maintain my progress and handle setbacks. It's something that's been on my mind a lot lately.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable. Let's start by reviewing some of the key skills and insights you've gained from our work together. What are some of the most helpful tools or concepts you've learned?\n\nPatient: Well, I think the thought records have been really useful for me. They've helped me recognize when I'm falling into negative thought patterns and challenge those thoughts. And the coping cards have been great for reminding me of more balanced and realistic ways of thinking.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, those are powerful tools for managing negative thoughts and emotions. You've done an excellent job of integrating them into your daily life. Another key skill we've worked on is building self-compassion and a growth mindset. How have you been applying those concepts?\n\nPatient: It's been a bit harder for me, to be honest. I still find myself being quite self-critical at times. But I'm trying to catch myself when I do that and remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and has setbacks. It's part of being human.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Self-compassion is a practice, and it takes time to shift those long-standing patterns of self-criticism. The fact that you're noticing when you're being hard on yourself is a big step forward. Remember, it's not about being perfect, but rather about treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a good friend.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I wouldn't tell a friend that they're a failure because they had a bad day or made a mistake. I need to extend that same grace to myself.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And that ties into the growth mindset as well - seeing challenges and setbacks as opportunities for learning and growth, rather than as fixed failures. Let's talk about how you can continue to apply these skills after our sessions end. One helpful tool is creating a \"relapse prevention plan.\" This is a written plan that outlines the signs that your depression might be worsening, and the steps you can take to cope with those symptoms. It might include things like reaching out to a friend, engaging in self-care activities, or reviewing your thought records and coping cards. What do you think might be helpful to include in your plan?",
