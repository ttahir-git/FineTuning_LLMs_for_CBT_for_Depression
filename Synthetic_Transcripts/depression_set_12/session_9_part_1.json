  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for our 9th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned, but it's been challenging. I've been feeling more down than usual, and it's been hard to motivate myself to do the thought records and progressive muscle relaxation.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Jamie. It's common to experience ups and downs throughout therapy, and it's okay if you haven't been able to complete all the homework. Let's explore what's been making it challenging for you. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing since our last session?\n\nPatient: Well, I had a couple of job interviews, but I didn't get any offers. It's just so discouraging, and it makes me feel like I'm never going to find a job. I know we've been working on reframing negative thoughts, but it's hard to see the positive when I keep facing rejection.\n\nTherapist: I understand how discouraging that must feel, Jamie. Job rejections can be tough, and it's natural to feel down about it. Remember that your worth isn't defined by your employment status, even though it might feel that way sometimes. Let's take a moment to acknowledge your feelings of disappointment and frustration. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that have been going through your mind since the interviews?\n\nPatient: I keep thinking that I'm not good enough and that I'll never find a job. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of applying, getting rejected, and feeling worse about myself. I know it's not healthy, but it's hard to break out of that mindset.\n\nTherapist: You're right, Jamie. It can be challenging to break out of negative thought patterns, especially when facing repeated setbacks. I'm glad you're able to recognize that this cycle isn't healthy for you. Today, let's focus on strategies to help you cope with these feelings and reframe your thoughts. We can also discuss some job search strategies that might help you feel more empowered. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I could definitely use some help with coping strategies and reframing my thoughts. I'm open to discussing job search strategies too.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by setting an agenda for today's session. We can prioritize discussing coping strategies, reframing negative thoughts related to job rejections, and exploring some job search strategies. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main things I'm struggling with right now. Let's focus on those areas.",
