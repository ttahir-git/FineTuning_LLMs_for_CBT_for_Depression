  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like using thought records and challenging negative thoughts. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I had a particularly tough day a few days ago when I received another job rejection, and it sent me into a bit of a downward spiral.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed, even though it's been challenging. Receiving a job rejection can be really tough, and it's understandable that it triggered a difficult emotional response for you. Can you tell me more about what went through your mind when you received the rejection?\n\nPatient: When I got the rejection email, my first thought was, \"I'm never going to find a job. I'm a failure.\" It felt like all the progress I've been making just disappeared, and I was right back to feeling hopeless and worthless.\n\nTherapist: That's a really painful thought to sit with. Let's take a moment to acknowledge the emotions that came up for you. Besides hopelessness and worthlessness, what other emotions did you notice?\n\nPatient: I felt really sad and discouraged. I also felt angry at myself for not being good enough and frustrated with the whole job search process.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel a range of emotions in response to a setback like this. I want to acknowledge the sadness, discouragement, anger, and frustration that you experienced. It's important that we create space for all of your emotions, even the difficult ones.\n\nGiven what you've shared, I think it could be helpful for us to focus on a few key areas in today's session. First, I'd like to explore the thoughts and beliefs that were triggered by the job rejection and work on reframing them in a more balanced way. We can also discuss how you can practice self-compassion in the face of setbacks. Finally, I'd like to check in about the behavioral experiment we planned last session, the self-care day, and discuss how that went. Does this plan sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?",
