  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's create a coping card for the thought \"I'm not good enough.\" What would be a more balanced or adaptive thought to put on the other side of the card?\n\nPatient: How about something like \"I am enough, even when I struggle or make mistakes. My worth is not defined by my achievements.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great adaptive thought, Jamie. It acknowledges that everyone struggles and makes mistakes, and that doesn't define your worth. Let's write that down on the card. Now, when you find yourself thinking \"I'm not good enough,\" you can pull out this card and remind yourself of this more balanced perspective.\n\nPatient: I like that. It feels good to have a physical reminder that I can carry with me.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find it helpful, Jamie. Coping cards can be a really effective tool for challenging negative thoughts in the moment. You can create cards for other common negative thoughts as well, and keep them in your wallet or on your phone for easy access.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely do that. I can already think of a few other thoughts that I could use coping cards for.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Jamie. Remember, the more you practice using these tools, the more automatic they'll become. It's like building a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it gets.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'm looking forward to seeing how these coping cards work for me in real-life situations.\n\nTherapist: I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences with them, Jamie. Remember, it's okay if it feels a bit awkward or unnatural at first. That's part of the learning process. With practice, it will start to feel more natural and automatic.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I'll try to be patient with myself as I practice these new skills.\n\nTherapist: Being patient and compassionate with yourself is so important, Jamie. Learning new skills takes time and practice, and there will be ups and downs along the way. But every time you use a coping card or challenge a negative thought, you're taking a step towards a healthier and more balanced way of thinking.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. Every small step counts, even if it doesn't feel like a big breakthrough in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. Every small step is a step forward, and those steps add up over time. You've already made so much progress in our work together, and I'm confident that you'll continue to make progress as you keep practicing these skills.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the encouragement, Nova. It means a lot to hear that from you.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. I truly believe in your ability to keep making positive changes. Remember, you've got a whole toolbox of skills now, and you can keep adding to it as you go. You're not starting from scratch anymore - you've got a solid foundation to build on.\n\nPatient: That's a good reminder. I do feel like I have more tools and strategies now than I did when we started working together.\n\nTherapist: You absolutely do, Jamie. And you've been doing a great job of using those tools and strategies in your daily life. Keep up the good work!",
