  "transcript": "Therapist: Now that we've identified some of the core beliefs that may be contributing to your struggles, let's explore how they might be impacting your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in your daily life. Can you think of a recent situation where you noticed these beliefs showing up?\n\nPatient: Yeah, just the other day I was talking to a friend about my job search, and they suggested I apply for a position that I didn't feel qualified for. My immediate thought was \"I'm not good enough for that job,\" and I felt really discouraged and hopeless.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Jamie. Let's break down that situation using the CBT triangle. The situation was your friend suggesting you apply for a job. The thought was \"I'm not good enough for that job,\" which is connected to your core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" The feelings were discouragement and hopelessness, and the behavior was not applying for the job. Does that sound accurate?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's exactly how it played out.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so now let's challenge that thought using the evidence for and against it, just like we did with the job interview example. What evidence do you have that you're not good enough for the job?\n\nPatient: Well, I don't have all the qualifications listed in the job description, and I've been rejected from similar positions before.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against the thought that you're not good enough for the job?\n\nPatient: My friend thinks I'm qualified, and they know my skills and experience. I also have some transferable skills from my previous jobs and internships.\n\nTherapist: Great job identifying evidence against the negative thought, Jamie. Now, let's generate a more balanced and helpful thought based on the evidence. What would be a more realistic way to think about the situation?\n\nPatient: I could think \"Even though I don't have all the qualifications, I have relevant skills and experience that could make me a good fit for the job. It's worth applying and letting the employer decide if I'm a good candidate.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and adaptive thought, Jamie. It acknowledges your strengths and the potential for the job to be a good fit, even if you don't meet all the criteria. How do you think that thought would impact your feelings and behavior in that situation?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel more hopeful and motivated to apply for the job, instead of just assuming I'm not good enough and giving up.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By challenging the negative thought and generating a more helpful one, you can change the way you feel and behave in response to the situation. This is the core principle of CBT \u2013 that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected, and by changing one, we can impact the others.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's just hard to remember to do that in the moment when I'm feeling discouraged.\n\nTherapist: That's why we practice, Jamie. The more you use these skills, the more automatic they become. It's like building a muscle \u2013 the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets. And just like with physical exercise, it's okay to start small and gradually increase the difficulty. That's why we've been using thought records and behavioral experiments as homework \u2013 to give you opportunities to practice these skills in your daily life.\n\nPatient: I have been trying to do the thought records, but sometimes I get stuck on identifying the evidence against my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Jamie. One strategy that can be helpful is to imagine what you would say to a friend who was in the same situation and had the same negative thought. We're often much more compassionate and objective when it comes to other people than we are with ourselves. So, if a friend said to you \"I'm not good enough for that job,\" what evidence would you point out to them that contradicts that thought?\n\nPatient: I would probably remind them of their strengths and accomplishments, and point out that job descriptions often list ideal qualifications but that doesn't mean they're required.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Jamie. You can use that same logic when challenging your own negative thoughts. Another strategy is to ask yourself \"Is this thought helpful?\" Even if a thought is true, if it's not helpful, it's not serving you. So, in the job example, even if it's true that you don't have all the qualifications, focusing on that thought isn't helpful because it just makes you feel discouraged and less likely to apply.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to remember to ask myself that question when I'm struggling with negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Great, I think that will be a helpful tool for you, Jamie. Remember, challenging negative thoughts is a skill, and like any skill, it takes practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.",
