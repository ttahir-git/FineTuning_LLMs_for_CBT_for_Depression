  "transcript": "Patient: To me, self-compassion means treating myself with the same kindness and understanding that I would offer to a good friend who was struggling. It's about acknowledging that I'm human and that it's okay to make mistakes or have setbacks. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice self-compassion by noticing when I'm being self-critical and instead offering myself words of encouragement or comfort.\n\nTherapist: That's a beautiful definition of self-compassion, Jamie. Recognizing that we're all human and that setbacks and mistakes are a normal part of the human experience is a key component of self-compassion. I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing noticing your self-critical thoughts and offering yourself words of encouragement and comfort instead.\n\nCan you share an example of a time when you practiced self-compassion since our last session? What was the situation, and how did you respond to yourself?\n\nPatient: One example that comes to mind is when I was working on a job application and I caught myself thinking, \"This is taking me so long. I should be able to do this faster. I'm so inefficient.\" In the past, I would have just believed that thought and felt really down about myself. But this time, I tried to practice self-compassion.\n\nI reminded myself that job applications are challenging and time-consuming for everyone, and that it's okay to take my time to do a thorough job. I also told myself that my worth isn't tied to how quickly I can complete a task, and that I'm doing the best I can.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example of self-compassion in action, Jamie. By challenging the self-critical thought and offering yourself understanding and encouragement instead, you were able to shift your perspective and treat yourself with kindness.\n\nOne helpful way to practice self-compassion is to ask yourself, \"What would I say to a good friend who was in this situation?\" Often, we're much kinder and more understanding with others than we are with ourselves. By treating ourselves with the same care and compassion that we would offer to a friend, we can start to break the cycle of self-criticism and develop a more nurturing relationship with ourselves.\n\nAnother important aspect of self-compassion is mindfulness - being present with our thoughts and feelings without judgment. When we notice self-critical thoughts, instead of getting caught up in them or trying to push them away, we can simply observe them with curiosity and kindness.\n\nI'd like to introduce a self-compassion exercise that we can practice together now. It's called the \"Self-Compassion Break,\" and it involves three steps: mindfulness, common humanity, and kindness. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Mindfulness: When you notice that you're struggling or feeling emotional pain, take a moment to pause and acknowledge what you're feeling. You might say to yourself, \"This is a moment of suffering,\" or \"I'm noticing that I'm feeling [sad/angry/disappointed/etc.].\"\n\n2. Common Humanity: Remind yourself that suffering is a part of the human experience, and that everyone struggles at times. You might say to yourself, \"I'm not alone in this. Everyone feels this way sometimes,\" or \"This is part of being human.\"\n\n3. Kindness: Offer yourself words of comfort and understanding, just as you would to a good friend who was struggling. You might say to yourself, \"May I be kind to myself,\" or \"I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough.\"\n\nWould you be willing to practice this exercise with me now, Jamie? We can use a recent example of a time when you were struggling or feeling emotional pain.",
