  "transcript": "Patient: I think looking for evidence could be helpful, but it's hard to remember to do that in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Jamie. It takes practice to challenge negative thoughts, and it's not always easy to do in the moment. That's why we often assign homework in CBT, to help you practice these skills outside of our sessions. Homework might include keeping thought records, practicing relaxation techniques, or engaging in activities that challenge your negative beliefs. How do you feel about the idea of homework?\n\nPatient: I'm open to it, but I'm a bit nervous about adding more to my plate when I'm already feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern. The goal of homework in CBT is not to add more stress, but to help you build skills and confidence in managing your thoughts and feelings. We can work together to find homework assignments that feel manageable and relevant to your goals. Speaking of goals, let's start to think about what you hope to achieve in therapy. What are some changes you'd like to see in your life?\n\nPatient: I'd like to feel more confident in myself and my abilities. I want to be able to engage in social situations and job interviews without feeling overwhelmed by anxiety and self-doubt.\n\nTherapist: Those are great goals, Jamie. We can definitely work on building your confidence and developing coping strategies for anxiety and self-doubt. Another important goal in CBT for depression is to increase engagement in activities that bring a sense of pleasure or accomplishment, even if you don't feel motivated at first. This can help challenge the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. What are some activities that used to bring you joy or a sense of achievement?\n\nPatient: I used to really enjoy playing music and going to yoga classes. But lately, I haven't had the energy or motivation to engage in those activities.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, Jamie. Depression can make it hard to find motivation or energy for activities we once enjoyed. In CBT, we often use a strategy called behavioral activation, which involves gradually increasing engagement in these types of activities, even if you don't feel motivated at first. The idea is that the more you engage in these activities, the more opportunities you have to challenge negative thoughts and build positive experiences. What do you think about starting small, maybe by setting a goal to attend one yoga class or play music for a short period of time this week?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of starting small. It feels more manageable than trying to jump back into all my old activities at once.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Jamie. Starting small and building gradually is a key part of behavioral activation. We can work together to set specific, achievable goals related to engaging in activities you enjoy. As you build momentum and confidence, we can gradually increase the frequency or duration of these activities. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: It sounds good. I'm willing to give it a try, even if it feels challenging at first.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Jamie. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, the goal is not perfection, but progress. Every small step counts, and we can celebrate each victory along the way. In addition to behavioral activation, we'll also continue to work on identifying and challenging negative thoughts, and developing coping strategies for managing difficult emotions. Do you have any questions or concerns about the plan so far?",
