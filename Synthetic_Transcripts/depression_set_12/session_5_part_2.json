  "transcript": "Patient: I think what got in the way of attending the second yoga class was my anxiety about being around people. I started worrying that I wouldn't fit in or that people would judge me for being new. As for reaching out to others, I just felt overwhelmed and didn't know where to start.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel anxious about being in a new social situation, especially when you're already dealing with depression. Let's break this down a bit. What specifically were you worried about in terms of not fitting in or being judged?\n\nPatient: I guess I was worried that everyone would already know each other and I'd be the odd one out. I also worried that I wouldn't be able to keep up with the yoga poses and that people would think I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: Those are common concerns when trying something new. Let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. Have you ever been in a situation where you were new and ended up fitting in or being accepted?\n\nPatient: Well, when I first started going to the community music group, I was really nervous. But everyone was welcoming and now I feel comfortable there.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. It shows that even if you feel anxious at first, it's possible to find acceptance and belonging in new situations. Now, what about the thought that you wouldn't be able to keep up with the yoga poses? Is there evidence against this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess the fact that I was able to do the poses in the first class shows that I'm capable of keeping up, even if I'm not perfect.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And even if you struggle with a pose, that's not necessarily a reflection of your worth or whether you fit in. Everyone has to start somewhere, and most people in yoga classes are focused on their own practice rather than judging others. Let's do a thought record for these worries about the yoga class. We'll identify the situation, your emotions, the automatic thoughts, evidence for and against, and come up with alternative thoughts. Would you like to give it a try?\n\nPatient: Sure, that sounds helpful.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's start with the situation. What was the triggering event?\n\nPatient: The triggering event was thinking about going to the second yoga class.\n\nTherapist: And what emotions did you feel in response to this situation?\n\nPatient: I felt anxious, nervous, and a bit hopeless.\n\nTherapist: On a scale of 0-100, how intense were these emotions?\n\nPatient: The anxiety and nervousness were probably around 80, and the hopelessness was around 60.\n\nTherapist: Okay, now let's identify the automatic thoughts that contributed to these emotions. What was going through your mind?\n\nPatient: I thought \"I won't fit in,\" \"People will judge me,\" and \"I'm not good enough at yoga.\"\n\nTherapist: Let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. We've already discussed some evidence against them, but let's write it down in the thought record. What's the evidence for the thought \"I won't fit in\"?\n\nPatient: I guess the evidence for it is that I'm new and don't know anyone in the class.\n\nTherapist: And what's the evidence against this thought?\n\nPatient: The evidence against it is that I've been new before, like in the music group, and ended up fitting in. Also, yoga classes are often welcoming environments.\n\nTherapist: Good. Now let's look at the thought \"People will judge me.\" What's the evidence for and against this thought?\n\nPatient: The evidence for it is that I'm not perfect at yoga and people might notice. The evidence against it is that most people are focused on their own practice and aren't there to judge others.\n\nTherapist: And for the thought \"I'm not good enough at yoga,\" what's the evidence for and against it?\n\nPatient: The evidence for it is that I struggled with some of the poses in the first class. The evidence against it is that I was able to do most of the poses, and it's okay to be a beginner.\n\nTherapist: Great. Now, based on this evidence, let's come up with some alternative thoughts. What's a more balanced way of looking at the situation?\n\nPatient: I guess an alternative thought could be \"It's normal to feel nervous about being new, but I've had positive experiences before and there's no reason to assume this will be different. Even if I struggle with some poses, that doesn't mean I'm not good enough, and people are likely focused on their own practice rather than judging me.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges your feelings while also considering the evidence. Now, let's re-rate the intensity of your emotions based on this alternative thought. How intense are the anxiety, nervousness, and hopelessness now?\n\nPatient: The anxiety and nervousness are probably around 50 now, and the hopelessness is around 30.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in intensity. This shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing our emotions. By examining the evidence and coming up with alternative thoughts, we can shift our perspective and feel better. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the easier it becomes.",
