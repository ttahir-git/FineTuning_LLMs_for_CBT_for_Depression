  "transcript": "Patient: Thank you for your support and understanding, Nova. I feel more at ease knowing that we'll approach my past experiences gradually and with care.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. Your well-being and comfort are my top priorities. As we wrap up today's session, let's review the goals and treatment plan we've established. We'll focus on identifying and challenging cognitive distortions using thought records, engaging in behavioral activation through specific goals related to yoga, music, and social connections, developing coping strategies for managing depressive symptoms and stress, and exploring underlying factors contributing to your depression. How do you feel about this plan?\n\nPatient: I feel good about the plan. It covers the areas I want to work on, and I appreciate the balanced approach between thoughts, behaviors, and underlying factors.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad the plan resonates with you. For homework, I'd like you to continue completing at least one thought record per day, attend two yoga classes, practice music for 20-30 minutes on three days, and reach out to at least one person from your yoga class or community. Remember to celebrate your progress and be kind to yourself throughout the process. Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?\n\nPatient: No, I think the homework is clear and manageable. I'll do my best to complete it and discuss my progress with you in our next session.\n\nTherapist: That sounds great, Jamie.
