  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda looks good to me. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's begin by reviewing your progress with the homework I assigned last session. How did you find practicing the distress tolerance techniques when feeling overwhelmed?\n\nPatient: The deep breathing and grounding exercises were helpful when I remembered to do them. I noticed that I was able to calm myself down a bit when I felt anxious or stressed. However, there were times when I forgot to use them or didn't feel motivated to try.\n\nTherapist: It's common to forget or feel unmotivated at times, especially when you're just starting to incorporate these techniques into your routine. The fact that you found them helpful when you did use them is a positive sign. What about the thought records? How did you find identifying and challenging your cognitive distortions?\n\nPatient: I tried using the thought records a few times, but I struggled with identifying the distortions in the moment. I found it easier to look back on situations later and recognize the negative thought patterns, but it was challenging to catch them as they were happening.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. It's often easier to identify cognitive distortions in hindsight, and that's okay. With practice, it will become more natural to catch them in the moment. The key is to keep practicing and be patient with yourself. How about the behavioral activation goals we set? How did you find attending yoga, practicing music, and reaching out to others?\n\nPatient: I managed to attend one yoga class, and it felt good to be there, but I didn't make it to the second class. I found excuses not to go, like being too tired or not feeling up to it. As for music, like I mentioned earlier, I've been struggling to find the motivation to play. I did reach out to a friend from my yoga group, and we had a nice conversation, but I haven't followed up with them since.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you attended one yoga class and reached out to a friend. Those are significant steps in the right direction. I notice that you mentioned finding excuses not to go to the second class and struggling with motivation to play music. Let's explore that a bit more. What thoughts were going through your mind when you considered attending the second yoga class or picking up your guitar?\n\nPatient: I guess I was thinking that I wouldn't enjoy it as much as the first time, or that I wouldn't be good at it. With the guitar, I kept telling myself that I'm not as skilled as I used to be, and it's not worth trying if I can't play as well as before.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. It sounds like you might be experiencing some cognitive distortions, such as fortune-telling and all-or-nothing thinking. Fortune-telling is when you predict a negative outcome without evidence, like assuming you won't enjoy the yoga class as much as the first time. All-or-nothing thinking is when you see things in black-and-white terms, like believing that playing guitar is only worth it if you can play as well as you used to. Let's work on challenging these distortions and finding more balanced thoughts.",
