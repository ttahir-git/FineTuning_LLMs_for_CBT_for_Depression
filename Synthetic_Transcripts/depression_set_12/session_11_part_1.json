  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and self-compassion. It's been challenging at times, especially when I get stuck in negative thought patterns about my job search. I had a particularly rough day last week after receiving another rejection email. It sent me into a spiral of self-doubt and feelings of worthlessness.\n\nTherapist: I'm sorry to hear that you had a rough day, Jamie. Receiving rejection emails can be really tough, and it's understandable that it triggered negative thoughts and feelings. I'm glad you're able to recognize those thought patterns. Let's make sure to discuss that experience further today and see how we can apply the skills you've been practicing.\n\nBefore we dive in, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize today? We could explore the rejection email incident, review your progress with the homework, and perhaps introduce a new technique to add to your toolkit.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I definitely want to talk more about the rejection email and how it affected me. I could also use some help with reviewing my thought records and making sure I'm on the right track with them. And I'm always open to learning new techniques that might help me cope better.\n\nTherapist: Great, so it seems like our agenda for today includes:\n\n1. Exploring the rejection email incident and its impact on your thoughts and feelings\n2. Reviewing your progress with thought records and other homework assignments\n3. Introducing a new technique to help with coping and managing negative thoughts\n\nDoes that sound about right? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it. I'm looking forward to diving in and getting your guidance on these topics.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's start with the rejection email incident. Can you walk me through what happened and what thoughts and feelings came up for you?\n\nPatient: Sure. I had applied for a job that I thought I was really well-suited for. I spent a lot of time tailoring my resume and cover letter, and I felt hopeful about my chances. But then, last week, I got a generic rejection email saying they had decided to move forward with other candidates. As soon as I read it, I felt my heart sink, and all these negative thoughts started swirling in my head.\n\nTherapist: I can imagine how disappointing and discouraging that must have felt, especially after putting in so much effort. What were some of the specific negative thoughts that came up for you in that moment?",
