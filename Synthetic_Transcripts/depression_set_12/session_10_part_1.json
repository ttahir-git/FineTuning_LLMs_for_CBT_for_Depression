  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 10. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say, as I can't directly observe non-verbal cues. If you ever feel I've misunderstood you, please let me know so we can clarify. Lastly, I want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a crisis situation, it's essential to reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted support person in your life.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm here today because I've been struggling with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, especially related to my job search. It's been challenging to stay motivated and believe in myself.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, Jamie, and I'm glad you're able to share these struggles with me. Let's start by exploring how your mood has been since our last session. Can you tell me more about the feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness you've been experiencing?\n\nPatient: It's been a tough week. I had a job interview that I thought went well, but I found out yesterday that I didn't get the position. It feels like every rejection is a confirmation that I'm not good enough, and it's hard to shake off those negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Receiving a job rejection can be incredibly discouraging, and it's understandable that it's triggered feelings of worthlessness. Remember, though, that a job rejection doesn't define your worth or value as a person. Let's explore this further. What thoughts went through your mind when you found out you didn't get the position?\n\nPatient: I immediately thought, \"I knew I wasn't good enough for this job. I'll never find a job that suits me.\" It's like a broken record in my mind, telling me that I'm a failure and that I'll never succeed in my field.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound very familiar, don't they? We've been working on identifying and challenging these negative core beliefs. I appreciate you sharing them with me today. Before we dive deeper into these thoughts, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I think I need help challenging these negative thoughts about my job search and my self-worth. I also want to discuss how I can practice self-compassion when I'm facing these challenges.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. Let's start by reviewing the thought records you've been working on since our last session. Then, we can practice challenging some of the negative thoughts you've shared today, and discuss strategies for practicing self-compassion. How does that sound?",
