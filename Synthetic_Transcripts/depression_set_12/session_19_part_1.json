  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misunderstand something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted support person. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like body language or tone of voice. With all that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How are you feeling today, and what's been on your mind since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I had a couple of rough days where my mood was pretty low, and I struggled to motivate myself to do much. But I tried to use the coping cards and thought records like we discussed, and I think they helped a bit. I also reached out to a friend from my yoga class, and we had a nice chat. It reminded me how important social connection is, even when I don't feel like reaching out.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you were able to use the coping tools we've discussed, even when you were feeling low. That's a big step forward in managing your depression. I'm also glad to hear that you reached out to a friend. Social support is crucial, and it's wonderful that you recognized that need and took action. Can you tell me more about how the coping cards and thought records helped you during those rough days?\n\nPatient: Well, when I was feeling really down, I pulled out one of the coping cards that said, \"Thoughts are not facts. Just because I feel worthless doesn't mean I am.\" It helped me challenge that negative thought and try to see things from a different perspective. And with the thought records, I was able to identify some of the distortions in my thinking, like catastrophizing and black-and-white thinking. It didn't make the feelings go away completely, but it helped me not spiral as much as I might have before.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example of how you can use these tools to manage difficult emotions. Challenging those negative thoughts and recognizing the distortions is a key part of CBT. And you're right, the goal isn't to make the feelings disappear entirely, but rather to help you cope with them in a healthier way. I'm really proud of the progress you've made in using these skills. Now, for today's session, what would you like to focus on? We could discuss your experience with the coping tools in more depth, explore any other challenges that have come up, or review some of the other skills we've covered to reinforce your learning.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to talk more about maintaining my progress after therapy ends. I'm feeling a bit nervous about not having this regular support, even though I know I've learned a lot of useful skills. And maybe we could also discuss how to handle setbacks, because I know they're bound to happen.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea. It's completely normal to feel some anxiety about ending therapy, and it's important that we discuss how you can maintain your progress and handle setbacks. We can review some relapse prevention strategies and create a plan for how you can continue to support yourself after our sessions end. We can also discuss how to view setbacks as learning opportunities rather than failures, and how to use your CBT skills to cope with them. Does that sound like a helpful agenda for today's session?",
