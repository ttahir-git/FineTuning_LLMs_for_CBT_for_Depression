  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for our 18th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been trying to apply the skills we've discussed, like using thought records and challenging my negative beliefs. It's been a bit of a roller coaster, with some good days and some tougher ones. I did apply for that job we talked about, even though it felt out of reach. I haven't heard back yet, but I'm trying not to let that discourage me too much.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've worked on, Jamie. Applying for that job is a big step forward, and it shows a lot of courage. Remember, the outcome doesn't define your worth or progress. I'm curious, how have you been feeling emotionally since our last session? Have there been any changes or challenges that have come up?\n\nPatient: Emotionally, I've had some ups and downs. I had a couple of really low days where I felt pretty hopeless and unmotivated. But I tried to use some of the coping strategies we've talked about, like reaching out to a friend and doing some yoga. That seemed to help a bit. I've also been journaling more, trying to notice when that \"I'm not good enough\" belief pops up.\n\nTherapist: It's encouraging to hear that you've been able to use coping strategies and reach out for support during those low moments, Jamie. That shows a lot of self-awareness and resilience. Journaling is also a great way to track your thoughts and notice patterns. I'm wondering, based on what you've shared, what would you like to focus on in our session today? We could explore the emotional ups and downs you've experienced, discuss the job application process and how you're coping with the uncertainty, or perhaps review and practice some of the skills we've covered so far.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to talk more about the emotional ups and downs and how to manage them better. The uncertainty around the job application has been triggering some of those feelings of not being good enough. Maybe we could also review some of the skills and see if there are any new ones that could help?\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Jamie. We can definitely explore the emotional ups and downs you've been experiencing and how they relate to your core belief of not being good enough. We can also review the skills we've covered so far and introduce some new ones that might be helpful in managing these challenges. How does that sound for our agenda today?\n\nPatient: That sounds perfect, Nova. I'm ready to dive in.",
