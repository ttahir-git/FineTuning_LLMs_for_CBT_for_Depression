  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you for our 20th session together. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. And since our interaction is text-based, I can't observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm fully committed to supporting you in our work together. How have you been since our last session? I'm interested to hear about any changes, challenges, or positive experiences you've had.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations as an AI, I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing alright. I had a couple of rough days where my mood was pretty low and I struggled with negative thoughts. But I tried to use the coping cards and thought records like we discussed. It did help to challenge some of those distortions. I also reached out to a friend from my yoga group when I was feeling down, and that helped too.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you were able to use the skills we've practiced, like the coping cards and thought records, to manage the rough days. Reaching out to your friend shows a lot of strength and progress in your ability to seek support when needed. \n\nI'd like to spend some time today reviewing your relapse prevention plan and wellness action plan. We can discuss how you've been applying those strategies and make any adjustments if needed. What else would you like to prioritize for our agenda today?\n\nPatient: I think reviewing the relapse prevention plan and wellness action plan is a good idea. I also wanted to talk more about self-compassion. I'm still struggling with being kind to myself when I have setbacks. It's hard not to fall into that \"I'm not good enough\" belief. And maybe we could do another thought record together? I find those really helpful.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely focus on self-compassion and work through a thought record together. Self-compassion is a crucial skill that can help counteract that core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" We can explore some strategies to help you practice being kinder and more understanding towards yourself, especially during setbacks.\n\nSo it sounds like our agenda will include: \n1. Reviewing your relapse prevention plan and wellness action plan\n2. Discussing self-compassion and ways to practice it\n3. Completing a thought record together\n4. Checking in on your mood and any other challenges or victories since the last session\n\nDoes that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
