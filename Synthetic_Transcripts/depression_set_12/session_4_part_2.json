  "transcript": "Patient: When I thought about going to the second yoga class, I started feeling anxious and worried that I wouldn't be able to keep up with the others. I also felt like I wouldn't fit in because everyone else seems to have their life together, and I'm still struggling with basic things.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to have those concerns, Jamie. Let's explore these thoughts further. When you thought about not being able to keep up or not fitting in, what evidence did you have to support these thoughts?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I don't have concrete evidence. It's more of a feeling based on my past experiences of feeling like an outsider in social situations.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. You've identified that these thoughts are based on feelings rather than facts. This is a common cognitive distortion called \"emotional reasoning,\" where we assume our feelings reflect reality. Let's look at this objectively. Have there been times when you were able to keep up in a yoga class or felt like you fit in?\n\nPatient: Now that I think about it, there have been times when I did feel like I was able to keep up in a yoga class. And even if I couldn't do all the poses perfectly, no one seemed to judge me for it. There are also a few people in the class who have been friendly and welcoming.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thoughts that were holding you back. Recognizing these distortions and challenging them with evidence is a crucial skill in CBT. Remember, just because we feel something doesn't necessarily mean it's true. Let's continue to practice identifying and challenging these distortions.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to be more aware of when I'm using emotional reasoning and look for evidence against those thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Jamie. Another helpful technique we can use is behavioral activation. It involves engaging in activities that give us a sense of pleasure or accomplishment, even when we don't feel motivated. This can help counteract the avoidance that often comes with depression. Let's look at your experience with reaching out to others from the class or community. What thoughts and feelings came up for you around that?\n\nPatient: I felt nervous about reaching out because I worried that I wouldn't know what to say or that they wouldn't want to talk to me. I also felt like I didn't have the energy to engage in conversation.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid concerns, Jamie. Let's break this down into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of focusing on having a long conversation, what if you set a goal to simply say hello to one person before or after the class? How does that feel?\n\nPatient: That feels more doable. I think I could handle saying hello to someone without putting too much pressure on myself.\n\nTherapist: Great! Start with that small step, and we can gradually build up from there. Remember, the goal is to engage in the activity, not necessarily to feel a certain way while doing it. The more you practice, the easier it will become over time.",
