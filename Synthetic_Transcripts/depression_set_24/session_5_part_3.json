  "transcript": "Therapist: Great, let's start the body scan. Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable doing so. Take a few deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your lungs. \n\nNow, bring your attention to your feet. Notice any sensations you feel, such as warmth, coolness, pressure, or tingling. If you don't feel anything, that's okay too. Just notice that. \n\nMove your attention up to your legs. Again, just observe any sensations without judgment. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to focusing on your legs.\n\nContinue this process, moving your attention to your hips, stomach, chest, arms, hands, shoulders, neck, face, and head. Take your time and really tune in to each part of your body.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't to relax or change anything. It's simply to notice what's present in your body in this moment. If you encounter any areas of tension or discomfort, see if you can just observe them without trying to change them.\n\nPatient: That was interesting. I noticed I was holding a lot of tension in my shoulders and jaw. It was hard not to try to relax them, but I just kept bringing my attention back to the sensations.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. Many of us carry tension in our bodies without even realizing it. The body scan can help us become more aware of that. With practice, it can also help us learn to release that tension. \n\nI encourage you to practice the body scan at home this week, along with the mindful breathing. Aim for about 10 minutes a day, but even a few minutes can be beneficial. Remember, it's not about doing it perfectly. It's about practicing being present with your experience in the moment.\n\nPatient: I'll give it a try. It's good to have another tool to help manage my emotions when they feel overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Mindfulness techniques can be very powerful for managing distressing emotions. They help us step out of the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings and ground ourselves in the present moment.\n\nSpeaking of negative thoughts, I want to check in on how you've been doing with the thought records this week. You mentioned earlier that you're still finding them challenging to complete in the moment. Can you tell me more about what's been difficult?\n\nPatient: I think part of it is just remembering to do them when I'm feeling really down. It's hard to think clearly in those moments. And sometimes I'm not sure if I'm identifying the right thoughts or evidence.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common challenge. It can be hard to think clearly when we're really distressed. One thing that can help is to set aside a specific time each day to review your day and complete a thought record for any distressing situations that came up. \n\nIt doesn't have to be right in the moment. Even reflecting on it later can be helpful. And remember, there's no one \"right\" thought or piece of evidence to identify. The goal is just to start noticing how your thoughts are impacting your emotions and to practice looking at situations from different perspectives.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea to set aside a specific time. I think that would make it feel more manageable. And it's good to remember that it's not about getting it \"right,\" but just about practicing a different way of thinking.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's about developing a skill, and that takes practice. I'm really encouraged by the progress you've made so far, Jamie. You're putting in the effort and starting to see some changes in how you're relating to your thoughts and emotions. That's a big deal.\n\nPatient: Thank you. It doesn't always feel like I'm making progress, but it's good to hear you say that. I know it's a process and it's going to take time.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right. It is a process, and change happens gradually. But every small step you take is moving you in the right direction. I'm here to support you every step of the way.",
