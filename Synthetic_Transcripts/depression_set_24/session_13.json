  "transcript": "Patient: Hi, I'm back for session 13. Here is the summary you provided me at the end of our last session:\n\n- Main topics discussed: Reviewing homework progress (thought records, spending time in painting space), managing low energy levels and motivation, building a support system, and creating a balanced daily schedule.\n- Techniques or exercises used (with details on progress and plans for the future i.e. building on or introducing new techniques):\n  - Thought Records (ongoing): Jamie has been practicing thought records, especially when noticing negative thoughts about enjoying hobbies. They shared an example of using a thought record to challenge the thought \"I won't enjoy hiking anyway, so what's the point?\" and how it led to a small behavior change (going for a short walk). Jamie will continue to practice thought records as part of their homework.\n  - Behavioral Activation (ongoing): Jamie spent 15 minutes in their painting space, getting reacquainted with supplies. They found it challenging but recognized it as a step in the right direction. Jamie will continue to spend time in their painting space as part of their homework.\n  - Cognitive Restructuring (ongoing): Jamie has been working on reframing negative thoughts about enjoying hobbies and finding more balanced alternatives. They will continue to practice this skill in combination with thought records.\n  - Progressive Muscle Relaxation (ongoing): Jamie has been using this technique to manage stress and promote relaxation. They will continue to incorporate it into their daily routine.\n  - Balanced Daily Schedule (introduced): Jamie will work on creating a balanced daily schedule that includes a mix of activities promoting physical, emotional, and mental well-being, as well as rest and self-care. They will start with shorter periods of activity and gradually build up as their energy levels improve.\n- Homework assigned [in full detail]:\n  - Create a balanced daily schedule that includes a mix of activities promoting physical, emotional, and mental well-being, as well as rest and self-care. Start with shorter periods of activity and gradually build up as energy levels improve.\n  - Continue practicing thought records, especially when noticing negative thoughts about enjoying hobbies or other activities.\n  - Spend time in painting space, focusing on being present and reconnecting with the joy of painting. It's okay if no actual painting occurs; the goal is to build comfort and familiarity with the space.\n  - Take a small step towards reaching out to a neighbor for support, such as sending a text message or inviting them over for a cup of tea. The goal is to start building connection and opening up about challenges, even if it's just a little bit.\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - Jamie is making progress in managing negative thoughts and taking small steps towards engaging with hobbies (painting and hiking). They continue to struggle with low energy and motivation but are showing improvement in these areas. Jamie's depression symptoms remain present but are gradually improving.\n  - Jamie expressed feeling more hopeful and motivated after the session but acknowledged that they still face challenges ahead.\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs [IF DISCUSSED in this or previous sessions]:\n  - In this session, the intermediate belief related to perfectionism and all-or-nothing thinking was discussed in the context of creating a balanced daily schedule and setting realistic expectations for progress.\n  - In a previous session, the core belief \"I'm broken and defective\" was discussed.\n- Any important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Jamie's progress with thought records and mindfulness techniques, challenges with motivation and self-care, desire to build a stronger support system, and the newly identified intermediate belief related to perfectionism.\n  - Jamie's plan to create a balanced daily schedule and take a small step towards reaching out to their neighbor for support.\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review Jamie's experience with creating and implementing a balanced daily schedule, including any challenges or successes they encountered.\n  - Discuss Jamie's progress with thought records, spending time in the painting space, and reaching out to their neighbor for support.\n  - Continue practicing techniques for challenging cognitive distortions, explore Jamie's progress with managing low energy levels and motivation, and introduce additional strategies for building a support system and managing depression symptoms as needed.\n\nTherapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to remind you that while I'm here to support you, I do have some limitations as an AI therapist. I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me, and there's a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to working with you and supporting your journey towards better mental health. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the balanced daily schedule we discussed. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my energy levels and motivation. I'm still struggling with negative thoughts, especially around enjoying hobbies, but I've been using the thought records to challenge them when they come up.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on implementing the balanced daily schedule and using thought records to challenge negative thoughts. Small improvements are still progress, and it's important to acknowledge and celebrate them. You mentioned struggling with negative thoughts around enjoying hobbies. Can you share an example of a specific thought that came up and how you used the thought record to challenge it?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I had the thought, \"I won't enjoy painting anymore, so there's no point in trying.\" It made me feel really discouraged and sad. But then I remembered the thought record and decided to challenge that thought. I looked at the evidence for and against it and realized that I haven't given painting a fair chance lately. I also remembered times in the past when painting brought me joy and a sense of accomplishment. So, I reframed the thought to, \"Even if I don't enjoy painting as much as I used to, it's still worth trying. I might surprise myself.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example of using the thought record effectively, Jamie. You identified the negative thought, examined the evidence for and against it, and found a more balanced alternative. It's great that you were able to draw on past positive experiences with painting to challenge the negative thought. How did you feel after reframing the thought?\n\nPatient: I felt a bit more hopeful and motivated. It didn't completely erase the doubt, but it made me more willing to give painting a try. I spent about 20 minutes in my painting space later that day, just getting reacquainted with my supplies and the feeling of being there. It wasn't easy, but it felt like a step in the right direction.\n\nTherapist: I'm really proud of you for taking that step, Jamie. It shows a lot of courage and commitment to your well-being. Spending time in your painting space, even if you didn't actually paint, is a form of behavioral activation. It's about breaking the cycle of avoidance and gradually reintroducing activities that have the potential to bring you joy and a sense of accomplishment.\n\nGiven what you've shared so far, I'd like to propose the following agenda for today's session:\n\n1. Review your experience with creating and implementing a balanced daily schedule, including any challenges or successes you encountered.\n2. Discuss your progress with thought records, spending time in the painting space, and reaching out to your neighbor for support.\n3. Introduce the concept of cognitive distortions and explore how they might be contributing to your negative thoughts.\n4. Continue practicing techniques for challenging cognitive distortions and explore your progress with managing low energy levels and motivation.\n\nHow does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: The agenda sounds good to me, Nova. I don't have anything else to add right now.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's start by reviewing your experience with creating and implementing a balanced daily schedule. How has that been going for you?\n\nPatient: It's been a mixed experience. Some days, I'm able to stick to the schedule pretty well, and I notice that I feel a bit more energized and purposeful on those days. But other days, I really struggle to motivate myself to follow through with the planned activities. I end up sleeping in late or spending too much time on the couch watching TV instead of doing the things I planned.\n\nTherapist: It's common to have ups and downs when trying to implement a new routine, especially when dealing with depression. The fact that you've had some successful days is a positive sign. Let's explore one of the days when you struggled to follow the schedule. Can you walk me through what happened on that day?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last Tuesday, I had planned to go for a short walk in the morning, spend some time in my painting space, and then call a friend in the afternoon. But when I woke up, I just felt so tired and unmotivated. I kept thinking, \"I don't have the energy for this today. I'll just stay in bed a bit longer.\" Before I knew it, half the day had gone by, and I hadn't done any of the things I planned.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. It sounds like the negative thoughts about your energy and motivation levels really influenced your behavior that day. This is a great opportunity to introduce the concept of cognitive distortions. Cognitive distortions are irrational or exaggerated thought patterns that can contribute to negative emotions and behaviors. One common distortion is \"fortune telling,\" where we predict that things will turn out badly without evidence to support that prediction. It seems like you might have been engaging in some fortune telling when you thought, \"I don't have the energy for this today.\" Would you agree with that?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see that now. I was predicting that I wouldn't have the energy to do the things I planned, even though I didn't really have evidence to support that prediction. I guess I just assumed I would fail based on past experiences.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Fortune telling can be a tricky distortion to catch because it often feels like a legitimate prediction based on past experiences. But the truth is, we can't know for sure how things will turn out until we try. One way to challenge fortune telling is to look for evidence that contradicts the negative prediction. For example, you could remind yourself of times when you did have the energy to do something you planned, even if you didn't feel like it at first. How do you think that might have helped you last Tuesday?\n\nPatient: I think it would have helped me to remember that even on days when I feel tired and unmotivated at first, I often feel better once I get started with an activity. Like last week, when I went for a short walk even though I didn't feel like it at first, and ended up feeling more energized afterwards. If I had reminded myself of that last Tuesday, I might have been more willing to give the planned activities a try.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Challenging the fortune telling thought by looking for contradictory evidence can help you approach the planned activities with a more open mind. It's not about forcing yourself to do things you truly don't have the energy for, but rather about testing out the negative predictions to see if they're accurate.\n\nAnother cognitive distortion that might have been at play last Tuesday is \"all-or-nothing thinking,\" where we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms. For example, you might have been thinking, \"If I can't do all the things I planned today, I might as well not do any of them.\" Does that resonate with you at all?\n\nPatient: Yeah, that definitely resonates with me. I often feel like if I can't do something perfectly, there's no point in doing it at all. Like with my painting, I sometimes think, \"If I can't create a masterpiece, I shouldn't even bother trying.\"\n\nTherapist: All-or-nothing thinking can be a major barrier to progress because it sets up an unrealistic standard of perfection. The truth is, even small steps forward are valuable, and perfection is rarely necessary or even possible. One way to challenge all-or-nothing thinking is to look for the gray areas between the extremes. For example, instead of thinking, \"If I can't do all the things I planned today, I might as well not do any of them,\" you could think, \"Even if I can't do everything I planned, doing one or two things is still better than doing nothing at all.\" How do you think that shift in thinking might have impacted your behavior last Tuesday?\n\nPatient: If I had thought that way last Tuesday, I might have been more willing to get out of bed and try one of the planned activities, even if I didn't feel up for doing all of them. Like maybe I could have gone for a short walk, even if I didn't feel like painting or calling a friend that day. It would have been better than staying in bed all day.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Challenging the all-or-nothing thinking can help you be more flexible and compassionate with yourself, which can make it easier to take small steps forward even on difficult days. It's not about lowering your standards or giving up on your goals, but rather about recognizing that progress is often incremental and imperfect.\n\nAs we continue to work together, we'll practice identifying and challenging cognitive distortions like fortune telling and all-or-nothing thinking. The more you practice, the easier it will become to catch these distortions in the moment and reframe them in a more balanced and helpful way.\n\nBefore we move on to discussing your progress with thought records and the other homework assignments, I want to check in with how you're feeling about our discussion so far. What thoughts or emotions are coming up for you?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. It's a lot to take in, and I'm not sure I'll be able to catch these distortions in the moment. I'm worried I'll just keep falling into the same old patterns.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed when learning new skills, Jamie. Recognizing and challenging cognitive distortions takes practice, and it's okay if you don't catch them every time. The fact that you're aware of these patterns is already a significant step forward. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are a natural part of the process. What matters most is that you keep trying and remain compassionate with yourself along the way.\n\nPatient: I guess you're right. I just put so much pressure on myself to get it right all the time. It's hard to break that habit.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Jamie. The pressure to \"get it right\" all the time is another example of all-or-nothing thinking. It's a common distortion, especially among people who struggle with perfectionism. One way to challenge this distortion is to practice self-compassion. Instead of judging yourself harshly for not meeting an unrealistic standard, try to speak to yourself with kindness and understanding, as you would to a good friend who was struggling.\n\nFor example, you could say something like, \"It's okay that I didn't catch that distortion in the moment. I'm learning a new skill, and it's going to take time and practice to get better at it. I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough.\"\n\nHow does that sound to you? Do you think practicing self-compassion could help ease some of the pressure you put on yourself?\n\nPatient: It sounds good in theory, but it's hard to actually do in the moment. I've been so used to criticizing myself for so long, it's like second nature.\n\nTherapist: You're right, practicing self-compassion can be challenging, especially if self-criticism has been a long-standing habit. It's like building a new muscle \u2013 it takes time and consistent practice to get stronger. One way to start is by noticing when self-critical thoughts come up and consciously reframing them in a more compassionate way.\n\nFor example, let's say you notice yourself thinking, \"I should have caught that distortion. I'm never going to get better at this.\" You could pause, take a deep breath, and reframe the thought in a more compassionate way, like, \"It's okay that I didn't catch that distortion this time. I'm learning and growing, and every small step counts.\"\n\nWith practice, self-compassionate thoughts can become more automatic, but it's okay if it feels difficult at first. The key is to keep trying and be patient with yourself along the way.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just hard to break old habits, you know?\n\nTherapist: I completely understand, Jamie. Breaking old habits and building new ones is a process, and it's normal to encounter obstacles along the way. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. I'm here to support you every step of the way, and we can work together to find strategies that work best for you.\n\nSpeaking of strategies, let's revisit your progress with the thought records and the other homework assignments. How have you been finding the process of using thought records to challenge negative thoughts about enjoying hobbies and other activities?\n\nPatient: It's been helpful, but I don't always remember to do it in the moment. Sometimes I get so caught up in the negative thoughts that I forget to pause and challenge them.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience, Jamie. It's okay if you don't remember to use the thought records every time. The fact that you're using them at all is a significant step forward. As we continue to practice, it will become more automatic.\n\nOne strategy that can help is to set aside a specific time each day to review your thoughts and complete a thought record. This can be especially helpful for thoughts that you didn't catch in the moment. By setting aside dedicated time, you're building a habit of regularly examining and challenging your thoughts, which can make it easier to do so in the moment as well.\n\nWhat do you think about setting aside 10-15 minutes each day to review your thoughts and complete a thought record? Is that something you feel you could commit to?\n\nTherapist: Setting aside a specific time each day to review your thoughts and complete a thought record can be a helpful way to build the habit and make it more automatic over time. It's okay if you don't catch every negative thought in the moment \u2013 the key is to keep practicing and be patient with yourself.\n\nPatient: I can try setting aside 10-15 minutes each day to review my thoughts and do a thought record. I'll put a reminder in my phone so I don't forget.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Jamie. Using a reminder can be a helpful way to stay consistent with the practice. As you continue to use thought records regularly, you'll likely find it easier to catch negative thoughts in the moment and challenge them more automatically.\n\nLet's shift gears a bit and talk about your experience with spending time in your painting space. How has that been going?\n\nPatient: It's been challenging, but also kind of rewarding. I've been spending about 15-20 minutes in my painting space a few times a week, just getting reacquainted with my supplies and the feeling of being there. I haven't actually painted anything yet, but I'm starting to feel a bit more inspired and motivated.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Jamie. Spending time in your painting space, even without actually painting, is a form of behavioral activation. By engaging with the environment and the supplies, you're taking small steps towards reconnecting with a hobby that has brought you joy and fulfillment in the past.\n\nAs we discussed in our previous sessions, behavioral activation is about gradually increasing engagement in activities that have the potential to improve mood and provide a sense of accomplishment or pleasure. It's not about forcing yourself to enjoy the activity right away, but rather about breaking the cycle of avoidance and creating opportunities for positive experiences.\n\nWhat thoughts and emotions come up for you when you're in your painting space?\n\nPatient: I feel a mix of emotions. Sometimes I feel nostalgic and remember the joy and fulfillment painting used to bring me. Other times I feel frustrated and discouraged, like I'll never be able to recapture that feeling. I also worry that I've lost my skills or talent after so much time away.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience a range of emotions when re-engaging with a hobby or activity after a period of avoidance. The nostalgic feelings and positive memories are a good sign \u2013 they suggest that painting still holds meaning and value for you, even if it feels challenging right now.\n\nThe frustration, discouragement, and worry are also understandable. These feelings often stem from cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking (\"If I can't recapture the exact same feeling, it's not worth trying\") and mind-reading (\"I've lost my skills and talent\").\n\nWhen these thoughts come up, it can be helpful to challenge them using the same techniques we've been practicing, such as looking for evidence against the thought and generating alternative perspectives.\n\nFor example, you might remind yourself that it's normal for skills to feel rusty after a period of inactivity, and that with practice and patience, you can rebuild those skills over time. You might also consider the possibility that your painting may evolve and change over time, and that's okay \u2013 it doesn't mean you've lost your talent or ability.\n\nWhat do you think about that perspective?\n\nPatient: I guess that makes sense. It's hard to let go of the expectation that things should be the same as they were before, but you're right that it's not realistic. I can try to be more patient with myself and focus on the process rather than the outcome.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Focusing on the process and being patient with yourself can help reduce the pressure and make it easier to engage with painting in a more mindful and self-compassionate way.\n\nAs you continue to spend time in your painting space, I encourage you to practice noticing and challenging any negative thoughts that come up, using the techniques we've been working on. You might also consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself, such as sketching for a few minutes or experimenting with different materials or techniques.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't to create a masterpiece or recapture a specific feeling, but rather to engage with the process and allow yourself to explore and express creatively.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of setting small goals for myself. That feels more manageable than trying to dive right back into a big project. I can try sketching for a few minutes at a time and see how it feels.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Jamie. Setting small, achievable goals can help build momentum and increase your confidence over time. As you continue to practice and experiment, you may find that your inspiration and motivation naturally increase as well.\n\nBefore we wrap up for today, I want to check in about the homework we discussed last session. In addition to continuing with thought records and spending time in your painting space, we had talked about reaching out to a neighbor for support. How has that been going?\n\nPatient: I've been struggling with that one, to be honest. I keep thinking about reaching out, but then I get nervous and talk myself out of it. I worry that I'll be a burden or that they won't understand what I'm going through.\n\nTherapist: Reaching out for support can be challenging, especially when depression makes it hard to feel connected and understood. The worries you mentioned are common, but they're also examples of cognitive distortions, such as mind-reading (\"They'll think I'm a burden\") and fortune-telling (\"They won't understand\").\n\nWhen these thoughts come up, it can be helpful to challenge them by considering alternative perspectives. For example, you might remind yourself that most people appreciate the opportunity to help and support others, and that your neighbor may be more understanding than you expect.\n\nYou might also consider starting with a small, low-pressure form of outreach, such as sending a text message or inviting them over for a cup of tea. The goal isn't to share everything that's going on right away, but rather to start building connection and opening up about your challenges, even if it's just a little bit.\n\nWhat do you think about trying a small outreach this week, like sending a text message to your neighbor to check in or ask how they're doing?\n\nPatient: I guess I could try that. It feels less scary than inviting them over or having a big conversation right away. I can start with a text message and see how it goes from there.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Jamie. Starting with a small outreach can help build your confidence and make it easier to take larger steps over time. Remember, you don't have to share everything right away \u2013 even a brief check-in can help strengthen the connection and create an opening for more support in the future.\n\nAs we wrap up for today, let's review the homework for this week:\n- Continue practicing thought records, especially when noticing negative thoughts about enjoying hobbies or other activities.\n- Spend time in your painting space, focusing on being present and reconnecting with the process. Set small, achievable goals for yourself, such as sketching for a few minutes or experimenting with different materials or techniques.\n- Reach out to your neighbor via text message to check in or ask how they're doing. Remember to challenge any negative thoughts that come up and focus on the small step of connection, rather than putting pressure on yourself to share everything right away.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about the homework, or anything else you'd like to discuss before we end for today?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it. I'll do my best to work on the homework this week and see how it goes.\n\nTherapist: You're doing great, Jamie. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are a normal part of the process. The key is to keep practicing, be patient with yourself, and celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\nIf you find yourself struggling with the homework or experiencing any significant changes in your mood or symptoms, don't hesitate to reach out for support. You can always contact me between sessions if needed.\n\nThank you for your hard work and openness today. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences with the homework next session. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Reviewing homework progress (thought records, spending time in painting space, reaching out to neighbor for support), managing low energy levels and motivation, building a support system, and creating a balanced daily schedule.\n- Techniques or exercises used (with details on progress and plans for the future i.e. building on or introducing new techniques):\n  - Thought Records (ongoing): Jamie has been practicing thought records, especially when noticing negative thoughts about enjoying hobbies and other activities.
