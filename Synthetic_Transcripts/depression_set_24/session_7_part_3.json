  "transcript": "Patient: My low energy has been making it hard to do anything, really. Even small tasks feel overwhelming, and I just don't have the motivation to push through it. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of feeling tired, not doing anything, and then feeling worse because I'm not accomplishing anything.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience for people struggling with depression. The lack of energy and motivation can create a vicious cycle that feels difficult to break. One way to start addressing this is through a technique called behavioral activation. The idea behind behavioral activation is that by engaging in activities, even when you don't feel like it, you can start to build momentum and gradually increase your energy and motivation over time.\n\nPatient: I've heard of that before, but I'm not sure how to actually do it. How do I get started when I barely have the energy to get out of bed?\n\nTherapist: That's a great question. The key is to start small and be consistent. Begin by identifying a few activities that you enjoy or that give you a sense of accomplishment. These could be things like taking a short walk, cooking a simple meal, or even just getting dressed and sitting outside for a few minutes. The goal is to engage in these activities regularly, even if you don't feel like it at first.\n\nPatient: Okay, I think I can come up with a few activities like that. But what if I try and I still can't do them?\n\nTherapist: If you find yourself struggling to engage in an activity, it can be helpful to break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, if taking a walk feels too overwhelming, start by just putting on your shoes and standing outside for a minute or two. Celebrate each small victory along the way, and be patient with yourself. Remember, the goal is progress, not perfection.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself to do everything at once, and that's just not realistic right now.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By setting small, achievable goals and celebrating your progress along the way, you can start to build momentum and increase your energy and motivation over time. Another helpful strategy is to track your mood and energy levels before and after engaging in an activity. This can help you identify patterns and see how even small activities can impact your overall well-being.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of tracking my mood and energy levels. It might help me see that I'm making progress, even if it doesn't always feel like it.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Tracking your progress can be a powerful tool for staying motivated and celebrating your successes along the way. Remember, even small changes can add up over time, and every step you take is a step in the right direction.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and talk about building your support system. You mentioned earlier that you want to open up more to your friends but have been finding it difficult. Can you tell me more about what's been holding you back?",
