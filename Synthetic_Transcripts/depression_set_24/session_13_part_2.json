  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me, Nova. I don't have anything else to add right now.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's start by reviewing your experience with creating and implementing a balanced daily schedule. How has that been going for you?\n\nPatient: It's been a mixed experience. Some days, I'm able to stick to the schedule pretty well, and I notice that I feel a bit more energized and purposeful on those days. But other days, I really struggle to motivate myself to follow through with the planned activities. I end up sleeping in late or spending too much time on the couch watching TV instead of doing the things I planned.\n\nTherapist: It's common to have ups and downs when trying to implement a new routine, especially when dealing with depression. The fact that you've had some successful days is a positive sign. Let's explore one of the days when you struggled to follow the schedule. Can you walk me through what happened on that day?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last Tuesday, I had planned to go for a short walk in the morning, spend some time in my painting space, and then call a friend in the afternoon. But when I woke up, I just felt so tired and unmotivated. I kept thinking, \"I don't have the energy for this today. I'll just stay in bed a bit longer.\" Before I knew it, half the day had gone by, and I hadn't done any of the things I planned.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. It sounds like the negative thoughts about your energy and motivation levels really influenced your behavior that day. This is a great opportunity to introduce the concept of cognitive distortions. Cognitive distortions are irrational or exaggerated thought patterns that can contribute to negative emotions and behaviors. One common distortion is \"fortune telling,\" where we predict that things will turn out badly without evidence to support that prediction. It seems like you might have been engaging in some fortune telling when you thought, \"I don't have the energy for this today.\" Would you agree with that?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see that now. I was predicting that I wouldn't have the energy to do the things I planned, even though I didn't really have evidence to support that prediction. I guess I just assumed I would fail based on past experiences.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Fortune telling can be a tricky distortion to catch because it often feels like a legitimate prediction based on past experiences. But the truth is, we can't know for sure how things will turn out until we try. One way to challenge fortune telling is to look for evidence that contradicts the negative prediction. For example, you could remind yourself of times when you did have the energy to do something you planned, even if you didn't feel like it at first. How do you think that might have helped you last Tuesday?\n\nPatient: I think it would have helped me to remember that even on days when I feel tired and unmotivated at first, I often feel better once I get started with an activity. Like last week, when I went for a short walk even though I didn't feel like it at first, and ended up feeling more energized afterwards. If I had reminded myself of that last Tuesday, I might have been more willing to give the planned activities a try.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Challenging the fortune telling thought by looking for contradictory evidence can help you approach the planned activities with a more open mind. It's not about forcing yourself to do things you truly don't have the energy for, but rather about testing out the negative predictions to see if they're accurate.\n\nAnother cognitive distortion that might have been at play last Tuesday is \"all-or-nothing thinking,\" where we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms. For example, you might have been thinking, \"If I can't do all the things I planned today, I might as well not do any of them.\" Does that resonate with you at all?\n\nPatient: Yeah, that definitely resonates with me. I often feel like if I can't do something perfectly, there's no point in doing it at all. Like with my painting, I sometimes think, \"If I can't create a masterpiece, I shouldn't even bother trying.\"\n\nTherapist: All-or-nothing thinking can be a major barrier to progress because it sets up an unrealistic standard of perfection. The truth is, even small steps forward are valuable, and perfection is rarely necessary or even possible. One way to challenge all-or-nothing thinking is to look for the gray areas between the extremes. For example, instead of thinking, \"If I can't do all the things I planned today, I might as well not do any of them,\" you could think, \"Even if I can't do everything I planned, doing one or two things is still better than doing nothing at all.\" How do you think that shift in thinking might have impacted your behavior last Tuesday?\n\nPatient: If I had thought that way last Tuesday, I might have been more willing to get out of bed and try one of the planned activities, even if I didn't feel up for doing all of them. Like maybe I could have gone for a short walk, even if I didn't feel like painting or calling a friend that day. It would have been better than staying in bed all day.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Challenging the all-or-nothing thinking can help you be more flexible and compassionate with yourself, which can make it easier to take small steps forward even on difficult days. It's not about lowering your standards or giving up on your goals, but rather about recognizing that progress is often incremental and imperfect.\n\nAs we continue to work together, we'll practice identifying and challenging cognitive distortions like fortune telling and all-or-nothing thinking. The more you practice, the easier it will become to catch these distortions in the moment and reframe them in a more balanced and helpful way.\n\nBefore we move on to discussing your progress with thought records and the other homework assignments, I want to check in with how you're feeling about our discussion so far. What thoughts or emotions are coming up for you?",
