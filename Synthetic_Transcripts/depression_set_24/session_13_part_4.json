  "transcript": "Therapist: Setting aside a specific time each day to review your thoughts and complete a thought record can be a helpful way to build the habit and make it more automatic over time. It's okay if you don't catch every negative thought in the moment \u2013 the key is to keep practicing and be patient with yourself.\n\nPatient: I can try setting aside 10-15 minutes each day to review my thoughts and do a thought record. I'll put a reminder in my phone so I don't forget.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Jamie. Using a reminder can be a helpful way to stay consistent with the practice. As you continue to use thought records regularly, you'll likely find it easier to catch negative thoughts in the moment and challenge them more automatically.\n\nLet's shift gears a bit and talk about your experience with spending time in your painting space. How has that been going?\n\nPatient: It's been challenging, but also kind of rewarding. I've been spending about 15-20 minutes in my painting space a few times a week, just getting reacquainted with my supplies and the feeling of being there. I haven't actually painted anything yet, but I'm starting to feel a bit more inspired and motivated.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Jamie. Spending time in your painting space, even without actually painting, is a form of behavioral activation. By engaging with the environment and the supplies, you're taking small steps towards reconnecting with a hobby that has brought you joy and fulfillment in the past.\n\nAs we discussed in our previous sessions, behavioral activation is about gradually increasing engagement in activities that have the potential to improve mood and provide a sense of accomplishment or pleasure. It's not about forcing yourself to enjoy the activity right away, but rather about breaking the cycle of avoidance and creating opportunities for positive experiences.\n\nWhat thoughts and emotions come up for you when you're in your painting space?\n\nPatient: I feel a mix of emotions. Sometimes I feel nostalgic and remember the joy and fulfillment painting used to bring me. Other times I feel frustrated and discouraged, like I'll never be able to recapture that feeling. I also worry that I've lost my skills or talent after so much time away.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience a range of emotions when re-engaging with a hobby or activity after a period of avoidance. The nostalgic feelings and positive memories are a good sign \u2013 they suggest that painting still holds meaning and value for you, even if it feels challenging right now.\n\nThe frustration, discouragement, and worry are also understandable. These feelings often stem from cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking (\"If I can't recapture the exact same feeling, it's not worth trying\") and mind-reading (\"I've lost my skills and talent\").\n\nWhen these thoughts come up, it can be helpful to challenge them using the same techniques we've been practicing, such as looking for evidence against the thought and generating alternative perspectives.\n\nFor example, you might remind yourself that it's normal for skills to feel rusty after a period of inactivity, and that with practice and patience, you can rebuild those skills over time. You might also consider the possibility that your painting may evolve and change over time, and that's okay \u2013 it doesn't mean you've lost your talent or ability.\n\nWhat do you think about that perspective?\n\nPatient: I guess that makes sense. It's hard to let go of the expectation that things should be the same as they were before, but you're right that it's not realistic. I can try to be more patient with myself and focus on the process rather than the outcome.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Focusing on the process and being patient with yourself can help reduce the pressure and make it easier to engage with painting in a more mindful and self-compassionate way.\n\nAs you continue to spend time in your painting space, I encourage you to practice noticing and challenging any negative thoughts that come up, using the techniques we've been working on. You might also consider setting small, achievable goals for yourself, such as sketching for a few minutes or experimenting with different materials or techniques.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't to create a masterpiece or recapture a specific feeling, but rather to engage with the process and allow yourself to explore and express creatively.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of setting small goals for myself. That feels more manageable than trying to dive right back into a big project. I can try sketching for a few minutes at a time and see how it feels.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Jamie. Setting small, achievable goals can help build momentum and increase your confidence over time. As you continue to practice and experiment, you may find that your inspiration and motivation naturally increase as well.\n\nBefore we wrap up for today, I want to check in about the homework we discussed last session. In addition to continuing with thought records and spending time in your painting space, we had talked about reaching out to a neighbor for support. How has that been going?\n\nPatient: I've been struggling with that one, to be honest. I keep thinking about reaching out, but then I get nervous and talk myself out of it. I worry that I'll be a burden or that they won't understand what I'm going through.\n\nTherapist: Reaching out for support can be challenging, especially when depression makes it hard to feel connected and understood. The worries you mentioned are common, but they're also examples of cognitive distortions, such as mind-reading (\"They'll think I'm a burden\") and fortune-telling (\"They won't understand\").\n\nWhen these thoughts come up, it can be helpful to challenge them by considering alternative perspectives. For example, you might remind yourself that most people appreciate the opportunity to help and support others, and that your neighbor may be more understanding than you expect.\n\nYou might also consider starting with a small, low-pressure form of outreach, such as sending a text message or inviting them over for a cup of tea. The goal isn't to share everything that's going on right away, but rather to start building connection and opening up about your challenges, even if it's just a little bit.\n\nWhat do you think about trying a small outreach this week, like sending a text message to your neighbor to check in or ask how they're doing?\n\nPatient: I guess I could try that. It feels less scary than inviting them over or having a big conversation right away. I can start with a text message and see how it goes from there.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Jamie. Starting with a small outreach can help build your confidence and make it easier to take larger steps over time. Remember, you don't have to share everything right away \u2013 even a brief check-in can help strengthen the connection and create an opening for more support in the future.\n\nAs we wrap up for today, let's review the homework for this week:\n- Continue practicing thought records, especially when noticing negative thoughts about enjoying hobbies or other activities.\n- Spend time in your painting space, focusing on being present and reconnecting with the process. Set small, achievable goals for yourself, such as sketching for a few minutes or experimenting with different materials or techniques.\n- Reach out to your neighbor via text message to check in or ask how they're doing. Remember to challenge any negative thoughts that come up and focus on the small step of connection, rather than putting pressure on yourself to share everything right away.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about the homework, or anything else you'd like to discuss before we end for today?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it. I'll do my best to work on the homework this week and see how it goes.\n\nTherapist: You're doing great, Jamie. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are a normal part of the process. The key is to keep practicing, be patient with yourself, and celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\nIf you find yourself struggling with the homework or experiencing any significant changes in your mood or symptoms, don't hesitate to reach out for support. You can always contact me between sessions if needed.\n\nThank you for your hard work and openness today. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences with the homework next session. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Reviewing homework progress (thought records, spending time in painting space, reaching out to neighbor for support), managing low energy levels and motivation, building a support system, and creating a balanced daily schedule.\n- Techniques or exercises used (with details on progress and plans for the future i.e. building on or introducing new techniques):\n  - Thought Records (ongoing): Jamie has been practicing thought records, especially when noticing negative thoughts about enjoying hobbies and other activities.
