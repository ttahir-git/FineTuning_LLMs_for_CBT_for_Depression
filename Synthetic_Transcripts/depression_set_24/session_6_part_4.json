  "transcript": "Patient: I think I could start by setting a goal to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. I know that regulating my sleep schedule could help improve my mood and energy levels. I could also try to take a short walk every day, even if it's just around the block. I used to enjoy walking in nature, so that might help me feel more grounded and relaxed.\n\nTherapist: Those are great self-care goals. Setting a consistent sleep schedule and engaging in regular physical activity, like walking in nature, can have a big impact on your mental health. Remember to start small and be patient with yourself. It's okay if you don't meet your goals every day. The important thing is that you're making progress and taking steps to care for yourself.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the encouragement. I'll try to be patient with myself and celebrate the small victories.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude to have. Celebrating small victories can help you build momentum and feel more confident in your ability to make positive changes. As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in with you about your current mood and any final thoughts you have.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also hopeful. It's a lot to take in, but I feel like I have some concrete strategies to work on now. I'm grateful for your support and encouragement.\n\nTherapist: It's normal to feel overwhelmed when you're learning new skills and making changes in your life. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have setbacks. The important thing is that you keep trying and reach out for support when you need it. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate that.\n\nTherapist: Before we end today's session, let's discuss your homework for the week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought records and mindfulness exercises we've discussed, and also try out some of the new techniques we covered today, like the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique and progressive muscle relaxation. In addition, I'd like you to set a goal related to self-care, like going to bed and waking up at the same time every day or taking a short walk in nature. Finally, I encourage you to reach out to a trusted friend or family member and share with them how you're feeling. Does this sound manageable for you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds manageable. I'll do my best to practice the techniques and work on my self-care goals. I'll also try to reach out to my friend from college and let her know how I'm doing.\n\nTherapist: That's great. I'm confident that with practice and persistence, you'll start to see improvements in your mood and overall well-being. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. Reach out for support when you need it, and celebrate your progress along the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you. I'll do my best.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Managing overwhelming emotions, building a support system, and improving self-care practices.\n- Techniques or exercises used (with details on progress and plans for the future i.e. building on or introducing new techniques): Thought records (ongoing), mindful breathing (ongoing), body scan (ongoing), 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique (introduced), progressive muscle relaxation (introduced). In previous sessions, we have also used cognitive restructuring, activity scheduling, behavioral activation, and gratitude journaling. The patient will continue practicing these techniques and building on them in future sessions.\n- Homework assigned [in full detail]: Complete thought records, especially on difficult days; practice mindfulness techniques (mindful breathing, body scan) for about 10 minutes a day; try out the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique and progressive muscle relaxation when feeling overwhelmed; set a self-care goal related to sleep or physical activity; reach out to a trusted friend or family member and share how they're feeling.\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details: The patient is making progress in identifying and challenging negative thoughts and is starting to see some changes in their mood. They find it challenging to complete thought records in the moment when feeling distressed but is open to setting aside a specific time each day to reflect and complete them. The patient struggles with self-care practices, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and engaging in regular physical activity. They also tend to isolate themselves when feeling down and have a hard time reaching out for help.\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs [IF DISCUSSED in this or previous sessions]: In previous sessions, we have identified core beliefs related to worthlessness and unlovability, and intermediate beliefs related to perfectionism and the need for approval from others.\n- Any important information to carry forward to future sessions: The patient's specific cognitive distortions, progress with thought records and mindfulness techniques, challenges with motivation and self-care, desire to build a stronger support system.\n- Plan for the next session: Review the patient's homework, including thought records and experience with new techniques (5-4-3-2-1 grounding, progressive muscle relaxation); continue practicing techniques for challenging cognitive distortions; explore the patient's progress with managing overwhelming emotions and building a support system; introduce additional self-care strategies and discuss the connection between physical health and mental health.",
