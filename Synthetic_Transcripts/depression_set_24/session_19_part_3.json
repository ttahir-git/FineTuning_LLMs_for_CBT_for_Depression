  "transcript": "Therapist: You're absolutely right, Jamie. Mindfulness and observing our thoughts can create that space and make it easier to choose which thoughts to engage with. It's a skill that takes practice, but it can be really powerful in managing that inner critic. Speaking of practice, let's revisit the double standard technique. Can you walk me through another example of how you've used it since our last session?\n\nPatient: Sure. The other day, I was feeling really down about not having a job. I kept thinking, \"I'm a failure. I can't even support myself.\" But then I thought about what I would say to a friend in my situation. I would probably tell them that their worth isn't defined by their job and that they're doing the best they can in a tough situation. So, I tried to apply that same logic to myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Jamie. You caught yourself in a negative thought pattern and actively challenged it by considering how you would treat a friend in a similar situation. This is a powerful way to develop self-compassion and break the cycle of self-criticism. Remember, we're often much harder on ourselves than we are on others, but we deserve the same kindness and understanding we extend to our loved ones. How did you feel after applying the double standard technique in that moment?\n\nPatient: I felt a little better. It didn't make the situation go away, but it helped me feel less hopeless about it.\n\nTherapist: That's really significant, Jamie. Even a small shift in perspective can make a big difference in how we feel and how we approach challenges. And the more you practice this technique, the more natural it will become. It's like building a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it gets. Let's talk a bit about your progress with reaching out to your neighbor. How has that been going?\n\nPatient: It's been tough. I've been meaning to reach out, but I keep putting it off. I'm just nervous about what they'll think of me.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel nervous about reaching out, especially if you're worried about how you'll be perceived. Let's explore that a bit. What do you think your neighbor might think of you?\n\nPatient: I don't know. I guess I'm worried they'll think I'm needy or pathetic for reaching out.\n\nTherapist: That's a common concern, Jamie. We often worry about how others will perceive us, especially when we're feeling vulnerable. But let's look at this from another perspective. What would you think if a friend or neighbor reached out to you for support?\n\nPatient: I would be happy to help them. I wouldn't think they were needy or pathetic.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And chances are, your neighbor feels the same way. Most people are happy to help when they can, and they appreciate when others reach out to them for support. It's a sign of strength, not weakness, to ask for help when we need it. What do you think about trying to reach out to your neighbor this week, even if it's just a small gesture like saying hello or asking how they're doing?\n\nPatient: I can try that. I guess I don't have to have a big conversation right away. I could just start with something small.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Jamie. Starting with a small gesture can make it feel less daunting, and it can open the door for more meaningful interactions down the line. Remember, building connections takes time, and every small step counts. And if you do reach out and it doesn't go as well as you'd hoped, that's okay too. It's not a reflection on your worth or value as a person. It's just one interaction, and there will be plenty of other opportunities to connect.",
