  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing the thought record homework. Can you share an example of a negative thought you struggled to reframe this week?\n\nPatient: Sure. A few days ago, I woke up feeling exhausted and had the thought, \"I'm never going to have the energy to do anything meaningful.\" I tried to challenge it, but I couldn't come up with a strong alternative perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, and it's not always easy to find alternative perspectives, especially when the negative thoughts feel so powerful. Let's break this down together. What evidence did you have for and against the thought \"I'm never going to have the energy to do anything meaningful\"?\n\nPatient: For the thought, I guess the evidence was that I've been struggling with low energy for a while now, and it's been hard to engage in activities. Against the thought, I suppose there have been moments where I did have more energy, like when I went for those walks.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent start. You've identified evidence on both sides, which is a crucial step in reframing thoughts. Now, let's explore this further. Have there been times in the past when you were able to do meaningful things despite having low energy?\n\nPatient: Well, I used to push myself to go to work even when I didn't feel like it. And there were times when I helped my neighbors with their yard work, even though I was tired.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples. They show that even when you have low energy, you're still capable of engaging in meaningful activities. It might be helpful to reframe the thought as, \"Even though I often struggle with low energy, I've shown that I can still do meaningful things when I push myself.\" How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I don't give myself enough credit for the times when I do manage to do things despite my fatigue.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, but recognizing those moments is an essential part of reframing negative thoughts. As we continue practicing this skill, it will become easier to find alternative perspectives. Now, let's discuss breaking down hobby-related goals. Can you think of a hobby you'd like to reengage with?\n\nPatient: I used to enjoy painting, but I haven't done it in years. I'd love to get back into it, but it feels overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. Let's break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. What's the first small step you could take toward painting again?\n\nPatient: I guess I could start by digging out my old painting supplies and seeing what I have.\n\nTherapist: That's a great first step! It's simple and achievable, and it can help you reconnect with the hobby without feeling overwhelmed. Once you've taken that step, what could be the next small goal?\n\nPatient: Maybe I could set up a small space in my apartment where I can paint, even if it's just a corner of the room.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent idea. Creating a dedicated space can help make the hobby feel more accessible and inviting. As you continue taking these small steps, you'll build momentum and motivation. Remember, it's okay to start small and gradually work your way up.\n\nPatient: That makes it feel less daunting. I think I can manage those first few steps.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. As you work on reframing negative thoughts and breaking down goals, remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself. Progress isn't always linear, and that's okay. Now, let's review the progressive muscle relaxation technique to ensure you're getting the most out of it. Can you walk me through how you've been practicing it?",
