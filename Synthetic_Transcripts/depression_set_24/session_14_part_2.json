  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by exploring the thoughts and emotions you experience on those low days when you struggle to get out of bed. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that go through your mind during those times?\n\nPatient: On those days, I feel like I'm stuck in a dark hole, and there's no point in even trying because I'll just fail anyway. I feel hopeless and worthless, like I'm a burden to everyone around me. I keep thinking that I should be able to just snap out of it and be productive, but I can't seem to make myself do anything.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts and feelings sound incredibly painful and overwhelming. I want to acknowledge the strength and courage it takes to show up here and be honest about your struggles. The thoughts you're describing, like \"there's no point in trying\" and \"I'm a burden,\" are examples of cognitive distortions. Specifically, they fall under the categories of all-or-nothing thinking and labeling. These distortions can make it difficult to see things from a more balanced perspective. Let's explore these thoughts further.\n\nWhen you say, \"there's no point in trying because I'll just fail anyway,\" what evidence do you have to support this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned, but I haven't been able to do it consistently. I feel like I'm not making any progress, and I'm just going to keep disappointing myself and others.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it feels like you're not making progress, but let's look at the evidence objectively. You mentioned that you've had some days where you struggled to get out of bed and didn't attempt the thought records or painting. However, have there been any days where you were able to make some progress, even if it was small?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been a few days where I managed to do a thought record or spend some time in my painting space. But it's not enough. I should be able to do more.\n\nTherapist: I want to challenge that \"should\" statement. Who says you \"should\" be able to do more? Is that a realistic expectation, given the depression you're experiencing?\n\nPatient: I don't know. I just feel like I'm not doing enough.\n\nTherapist: That's a common feeling, but it's not necessarily based on facts. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm not doing enough.\" What evidence do you have to support this thought?\n\nPatient: I'm not doing the homework consistently, and I'm not making as much progress as I think I should be.\n\nTherapist: Okay, and what evidence do you have against this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, like you said, there have been some days where I did make progress. And I'm showing up here every week, even when it's hard.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Showing up here consistently is a sign of progress in itself. And the fact that you've had some days where you were able to do thought records or spend time in your painting space is evidence against the thought that you're not doing enough. \n\nNow, let's look at the thought \"I'm a burden to everyone around me.\" What evidence do you have to support this thought?\n\nPatient: I feel like I'm always asking for help and not contributing anything in return. I'm just dragging everyone down with my depression.\n\nTherapist: I understand that feeling, but again, let's look at the evidence objectively. Have your friends or family members expressed that they feel burdened by you?\n\nPatient: No, they haven't said that. But I still feel like a burden.\n\nTherapist: That's a common disconnect between feelings and facts. Just because we feel something doesn't necessarily mean it's true. What evidence do you have against the thought that you're a burden?\n\nPatient: My neighbor keeps checking in on me and inviting me to do things, even when I don't always say yes. And my friends from my old job still text me to see how I'm doing.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're a burden. It sounds like the people in your life care about you and want to support you, even when you're struggling.",
