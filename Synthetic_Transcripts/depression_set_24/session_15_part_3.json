  "transcript": "Patient: Setting aside a specific time each day to review my thoughts and complete a thought record seems manageable. I'll try to do it before bed, like you suggested.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Jamie. Consistency is key when it comes to practicing these skills. Remember, it's okay if you don't catch every negative thought in the moment. The important part is that you're setting aside time to reflect on your thoughts and challenge them when you're able.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best. It's just hard to break the habit of getting stuck in negative thought patterns.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it is a challenge to break long-standing thought patterns. That's why we've been working on identifying and challenging cognitive distortions, like all-or-nothing thinking and labeling. These distortions can fuel negative thoughts and make them feel more believable, even when there's evidence to the contrary.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I've noticed that I tend to fall into those distortions a lot. Like, if I'm not perfect at something, I feel like a complete failure.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Perfectionism and all-or-nothing thinking can be particularly challenging distortions to work through. They often lead to setting unrealistic standards for ourselves and discounting our successes and progress. Let's explore this further. Can you think of a recent situation where you noticed yourself engaging in perfectionistic or all-or-nothing thinking?\n\nPatient: Well, the other day I was trying to clean my apartment, but I got overwhelmed and didn't finish. I ended up feeling like a failure because I couldn't even complete a simple task like cleaning.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's break this down using a thought record. What was the situation, your emotions, and the specific thoughts that came up?\n\nPatient: The situation was me trying to clean my apartment but getting overwhelmed and not finishing. I felt frustrated, disappointed in myself, and hopeless. The main thought was \"I can't even clean my apartment properly, I'm such a failure.\"\n\nTherapist: I see. And how intense were those emotions on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: The frustration and disappointment were probably around 75, and the hopelessness was maybe 80.\n\nTherapist: Those are really intense emotions. It's understandable why this experience had such a strong impact on you. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm such a failure because I couldn't clean my apartment perfectly.\"\n\nWhat evidence do you see that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I couldn't even finish cleaning my apartment, which seems like a pretty basic task. It made me feel like I can't handle even simple things.\n\nTherapist: I hear you. Not being able to complete a task like cleaning can certainly fuel feelings of failure. Now, let's look at the evidence against this thought. What are some other ways to view this situation?\n\nPatient: I guess I could acknowledge that I did make some progress in cleaning, even if I didn't finish. And maybe I was expecting too much of myself, given that I've been feeling really low energy lately.\n\nTherapist: Those are great alternative perspectives! Recognizing the progress you did make and considering the context of your low energy are important factors to consider. Let's come up with a more balanced thought that takes into account both the evidence for and against the idea that you're a failure for not cleaning perfectly.\n\nWhat might a more balanced thought look like?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like \"I didn't finish cleaning my apartment, but I made some progress and I've been feeling low energy lately. Not being able to complete a task doesn't mean I'm a total failure.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic balanced thought! It acknowledges the difficulty you experienced while also recognizing the progress you made and the context of your low energy. How do you think your emotions might change if you focused on this balanced thought instead of \"I'm such a failure because I couldn't clean my apartment perfectly\"?\n\nPatient: I think I might feel a little less frustrated and disappointed in myself. Maybe the hopelessness would go down to more like 50 or 60 instead of 80.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense. Finding a more balanced perspective can help reduce the intensity of those painful emotions. It takes practice to catch and challenge these distortions, but over time it can get easier to find more compassionate ways of thinking about ourselves and our experiences.\n\nPatient: I can see how challenging these thoughts could help me feel a little better in the moment. But I worry that I'll just keep falling into the same negative patterns over and over again.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, and it's something we can continue to work on together. In addition to challenging negative thoughts in the moment, we can also work on addressing the underlying beliefs that fuel these thought patterns.\n\nRemember how we've talked about core beliefs and intermediate beliefs in previous sessions? Those deeply held beliefs about ourselves, others, and the world can shape how we interpret situations and experiences. By identifying and challenging those beliefs, we can start to shift our overall thinking patterns in a more helpful direction.\n\nPatient: I remember talking about those beliefs, but I'm not sure I fully understand how they connect to my thoughts and feelings in the moment.",
