  "transcript": "Patient: Hi, I'm Jamie. I'm here for my first therapy session. I'm not really sure what to expect, but I know I need some help dealing with my depression.\n\nTherapist: Hello Jamie, it's nice to meet you. My name is Nova, and I'm an AI therapist specializing in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Before we begin, I want to acknowledge some of my limitations as an AI. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information or misunderstand something you say. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, the purpose of our first few sessions is to assess your current situation, understand your reasons for seeking therapy, and start building a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Does this sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. I'm a bit nervous, but I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel nervous during your first therapy session. We'll take things at a pace that feels comfortable for you. To begin, can you tell me a bit about what led you to seek therapy at this time?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been struggling with depression for a long time, but it's gotten really bad lately. I lost my job a few months ago, and since then, I've been feeling hopeless and worthless. I don't have the energy or motivation to do anything, even the things I used to enjoy. My neighbor encouraged me to try therapy, so here I am.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. Losing a job can be a significant life event that impacts our mental health. You mentioned feeling hopeless and worthless, as well as lacking energy and motivation. These are common symptoms of depression. I'd like to explore these feelings further and understand how they're affecting your daily life. Before we dive in, let's set an agenda for our session today. We can start by discussing your current life situation and the challenges you're facing, and then we can begin to identify some goals for therapy. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I'm ready to talk more about what's been going on with me.",
