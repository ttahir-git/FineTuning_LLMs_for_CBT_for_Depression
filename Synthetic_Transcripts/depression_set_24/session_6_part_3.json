  "transcript": "Patient: I think those strategies sound really helpful. I like the idea of starting small and focusing on reaching out to one or two trusted friends. I have a close friend from college who I haven't talked to in a while, but I know she would be supportive if I reached out. I could start by sending her a text to catch up.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea. Reaching out to a trusted friend is a great first step in building your support system. When you send the text, try to be open and honest about how you're feeling and let her know that you value her support. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and lean on others when you're struggling.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely try that. I also like the idea of joining a club or group related to my interests. I used to love hiking, but I haven't done it in a while. Maybe I could join a hiking group in my area and meet some new people who share my interests.\n\nTherapist: Joining a hiking group is a great idea. Engaging in activities that you enjoy can help boost your mood and provide opportunities to connect with others. Plus, being in nature can be really calming and restorative. When you're feeling overwhelmed, it can be helpful to have activities like hiking to turn to as coping strategies.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see how hiking could be a great way to manage stress and connect with others. I'll look into hiking groups in my area and try to push myself to join one.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. Remember, building a support system takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the long run. As you continue to reach out to others and engage in activities you enjoy, you'll likely find that your mood improves and you feel more supported and connected.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the encouragement. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to put in the work to build a stronger support system.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. I'm here to support you every step of the way. In addition to reaching out to others and engaging in enjoyable activities, another important aspect of managing overwhelming emotions is practicing self-care. This includes taking care of your physical health by eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising regularly, as well as engaging in activities that promote relaxation and stress relief, such as mindfulness exercises or creative hobbies. How do you feel about your current self-care practices?\n\nPatient: To be honest, my self-care practices could use some work. When I'm feeling down, I tend to neglect my physical health. I have a hard time motivating myself to cook healthy meals or exercise regularly. I also struggle with sleep, often staying up late and then struggling to get out of bed in the morning.\n\nTherapist: It's common for people with depression to struggle with self-care, but taking care of your physical health can have a big impact on your mental health. Let's brainstorm some small steps you could take to improve your self-care practices. For example, you could set a goal to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day to regulate your sleep schedule. Or you could plan to take a short walk every day, even if it's just around the block. What small steps do you think you could take to improve your self-care?",
