  "transcript": "Patient: My balanced daily schedule has been going alright. I've been trying to stick to it, but some days are harder than others. I find that having a routine helps me feel more stable, but I still struggle with motivation at times.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been working on maintaining a balanced daily schedule, Jamie. Building a consistent routine is a powerful way to support your mental health. It's also normal to have days where motivation is harder to come by. On those days, what strategies have you found helpful to keep yourself on track?\n\nPatient: Well, I try to remind myself that even small actions can make a difference. Like, if I don't feel like going for a walk, I might just put on my shoes and stand outside for a few minutes. Usually, once I'm out there, I end up going for a short walk anyway. It's like starting with a small step makes the bigger steps feel more manageable.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic strategy, Jamie. Breaking tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps can be really effective in overcoming that initial resistance. It's like the concept of \"just do the next right thing.\" By focusing on one small action at a time, we can build momentum and make progress, even when our motivation is low. I'm curious, how have you been feeling emotionally as you've been working on your balanced daily schedule?\n\nPatient: It's been a mix. Some days, I feel really good about sticking to my schedule and taking care of myself. But other days, I still struggle with feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt. Like, even if I'm doing all the \"right\" things, I still don't feel like I'm enough.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, Jamie. It's common to experience a range of emotions as we work on making changes in our lives. The thoughts and beliefs that contribute to feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt are often deeply ingrained, and they can persist even as we make positive changes in our behavior. That's why we've been working on challenging those thoughts and beliefs with techniques like the double standard technique and self-compassion. Remember, your worth is not defined by your productivity or achievements. You are inherently valuable and worthy of love and respect, no matter what you do or don't do on any given day.\n\nPatient: I know that intellectually, but it's hard to really believe it sometimes. It's like there's this voice in my head that's always pointing out my flaws and telling me I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: That critical inner voice can be really loud and persistent, can't it? It's like a constant stream of negative self-talk that can drown out the more compassionate and realistic thoughts. One strategy that can be helpful in managing that inner critic is to practice distancing yourself from those thoughts. Instead of getting caught up in the content of the thoughts, you can observe them with curiosity and remind yourself that thoughts are not facts. You might say something to yourself like, \"I notice that I'm having the thought that I'm not good enough. That's just a thought, not a fact. I can choose to redirect my attention to more helpful thoughts.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's like I don't have to believe everything I think, right?\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. We have tens of thousands of thoughts every day, and many of them are automatic and not necessarily accurate or helpful. By practicing mindfulness and observing our thoughts with curiosity and non-judgment, we can start to create some space between ourselves and our thoughts. This can make it easier to choose which thoughts we want to engage with and which ones we want to let pass by. It's a skill that takes practice, but it can be really powerful in managing that inner critic.",
