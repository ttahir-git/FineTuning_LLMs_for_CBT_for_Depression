  "transcript": "Patient: I think what's been holding me back is the fear of being a burden to my friends. I don't want to bring them down with my problems, and I worry that they'll think less of me if they know how much I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: It's common to have those fears, but it's important to remember that your friends care about you and want to support you. Opening up to them can actually strengthen your relationships and help you feel less alone. Have you had any experiences in the past where sharing your struggles with a friend led to a positive outcome?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess there have been a few times where I opened up to a friend and it actually brought us closer. It's just hard to remember those times when I'm feeling really low.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. When we're feeling depressed, it can be difficult to remember the positive experiences we've had in the past. One way to counteract this is to create a list of supportive people in your life and reminders of times when sharing your struggles led to positive outcomes. You can refer to this list when you're feeling hesitant about reaching out for support.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I think having a list like that would help me feel more confident about opening up to my friends.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find that helpful. Another strategy is to start small when it comes to sharing your struggles. You don't have to share everything at once. Begin with something small and see how your friend responds. This can help build trust and make it easier to share more in the future.\n\nPatient: Starting small sounds more manageable. I think I could try that.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, building a support system is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. As you continue to practice reaching out and sharing your struggles, it will become easier over time.\n\nNow, let's wrap up today's session. Before we do, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling right now and if there's anything else you'd like to discuss.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better after talking through everything. It's helpful to have some strategies to work on, and I feel more hopeful about being able to manage my energy levels and build my support system.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling a bit better and more hopeful. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. Be patient with yourself and celebrate each small victory.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to:\n1. Practice progressive muscle relaxation at least once a day.\n2. Identify 2-3 activities you enjoy or that give you a sense of accomplishment and engage in at least one of them each day.\n3. Create a list of supportive people in your life and reminders of positive experiences you've had when sharing your struggles.\n4. Reach out to one friend this week and share something small that you're struggling with.\n\nHow does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I think I can manage that. I'll do my best to complete the homework and keep practicing the techniques we've discussed.\n\nTherapist: That's great! Remember, the homework is meant to help you practice and apply the skills we've discussed in session. If you find yourself struggling with any of the assignments, that's okay. Just do your best and we can discuss any challenges at our next session.\n\nHere's a summary of today's session:\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Managing low energy levels and motivation, building a support system, and practicing progressive muscle relaxation.\n- Techniques or exercises used (with details on progress and plans for the future i.e. building on or introducing new techniques): Thought records (ongoing), mindful breathing (ongoing), body scan (ongoing), 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique (ongoing), progressive muscle relaxation (introduced).
