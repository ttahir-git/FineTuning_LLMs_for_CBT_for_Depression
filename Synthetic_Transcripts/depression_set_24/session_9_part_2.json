  "transcript": "Patient: That makes sense, Nova. It's interesting to think about how my thoughts might not always be based on facts.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Our thoughts can often be distorted or biased, especially when we're dealing with depression. By examining the evidence for and against our thoughts, we can start to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective. Why don't we try practicing cognitive restructuring with an example from your week? Can you think of a situation where you had a strong negative thought?\n\nPatient: Well, the other day I was looking at job postings online and I started thinking, \"I'll never find a job that I'm qualified for. I'm just not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's use the cognitive restructuring process to examine that thought. First, what emotions did you feel when you had that thought?\n\nPatient: I felt really discouraged and hopeless. I think I also felt ashamed and frustrated with myself.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why you would feel that way. Those are difficult emotions to sit with. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'll never find a job that I'm qualified for.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been applying for jobs for a while now and haven't had any luck. I also don't have a college degree, which makes me feel like I'm not qualified for a lot of positions.\n\nTherapist: Okay, those are valid points. Now, what about evidence against this thought? Have you had any experiences that contradict the idea that you'll never find a job you're qualified for?\n\nPatient: I guess I have had jobs in the past that I was qualified for and enjoyed. And I do have some skills and experience, even if I don't have a degree.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the negative thought. What about the idea that you're not good enough? What evidence do you have for and against that thought?\n\nPatient: For the thought, I guess I feel like I've failed in a lot of areas of my life, like my marriage and my career. But against the thought, I know that I have good qualities too. I'm a loyal friend, I'm creative, and I'm resilient.\n\nTherapist: You've identified some really important evidence against those negative thoughts. Based on what we've discussed, how could you reframe the original thought in a more balanced way?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"Looking for a job is challenging and it may take some time, but I have skills and experiences that make me qualified for certain positions. Even though I've faced setbacks in my life, that doesn't mean I'm not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic reframe, Jamie! You've acknowledged the challenges of job searching while also recognizing your own strengths and qualifications. How does it feel to say that reframe out loud?\n\nPatient: It feels empowering, actually. Like I have more control over my thoughts and my situation than I realized.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. As we continue practicing cognitive restructuring, you'll likely find it easier to catch and challenge those negative thoughts in the moment. Remember, our thoughts are not always facts, and we have the power to examine and reframe them based on evidence.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's just hard to remember to do that in the moment when I'm feeling really down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. It takes practice to make cognitive restructuring a habit. One helpful tool is to use a thought record, which is a worksheet that guides you through the process of identifying negative thoughts, examining the evidence, and generating alternative thoughts. Would you be willing to try using a thought record as part of your homework this week?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that could be helpful. I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Great! We can go over an example of a thought record together and then you can practice using it on your own throughout the week. Remember, the goal is not to get rid of negative thoughts altogether, but to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective. It's okay if you don't always believe the alternative thoughts at first \u2013 the key is to practice considering other possibilities.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll do my best to practice with the thought record this week.",
