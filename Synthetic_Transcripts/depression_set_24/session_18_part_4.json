  "transcript": "Patient: I can see how that would be helpful. It's true that I'm much harder on myself than I am on others.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. By asking yourself, \"Would I say this to a friend?\" you can start to recognize when you're applying a double standard to yourself. Then, you can try to reframe your thoughts in a more compassionate way, like you would for a friend.\n\nFor example, let's say you make a mistake at work and think, \"I'm so stupid, I can't do anything right.\" Would you say that to a friend who made a mistake?\n\nPatient: No, of course not. I'd probably say something like, \"Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. It doesn't mean you're stupid.\"\n\nTherapist: Right. So, using the double standard technique, you could reframe your thought to something like, \"I made a mistake, but that doesn't mean I'm stupid. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: Great, Jamie. I think the double standard technique could be really helpful for you in challenging those negative thoughts.\n\nNow, before we wrap up for today, I want to check in on your mood. How are you feeling after our session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better, actually. It's helpful to talk through these things and get some new tools to try.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Jamie. Remember, progress isn't always linear, so don't get discouraged if you have some tough days. Just keep practicing these techniques and be patient with yourself.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the double standard technique, along with the other techniques we've discussed. Try to notice when you're applying a double standard to yourself and reframe your thoughts in a more compassionate way. You can also continue using your thought records and the downward arrow technique to challenge negative thoughts and beliefs.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll keep working on all of that. Thank you, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. I'm proud of the progress you're making. Remember, you can always reach out if you need support between sessions.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Practicing self-compassion\n  - Challenging negative thoughts and beliefs\n  - Double standard technique\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought Records (ongoing): Jamie will continue to practice thought records, especially when noticing negative thoughts about themselves or their abilities.
