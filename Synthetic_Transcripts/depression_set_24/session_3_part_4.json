I want to feel more in control of my thoughts and emotions and build a life that feels meaningful to me.\n\nTherapist: Those are powerful reasons to seek help, Jamie. Remembering your motivations can be a great source of encouragement when you face challenges in therapy. I'm confident that with consistent effort and practice, you'll start to see improvements in your symptoms and overall well-being. Let's wrap up today's session by reviewing your homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue completing one thought record per day, focusing on identifying and challenging cognitive distortions like mind reading. Additionally, try to engage in at least one enjoyable activity per day, such as going for a walk, listening to music, or cooking a healthy meal. Finally, I encourage you to reach out to a supportive person in your life, like your neighbor, and share with them what you're working on in therapy. This can help you build a stronger support system and increase your accountability. Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?\n\nPatient: No, I think I understand the homework assignments. I'll do my best to complete them and reach out to my neighbor for support.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Jamie. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.
