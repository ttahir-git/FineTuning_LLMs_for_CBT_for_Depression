  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some really important insights today, Jamie. Recognizing that thoughts are not facts and that you can choose which thoughts to engage with is a key part of managing that inner critic. And I'm glad we had a chance to discuss your concerns about reaching out to your neighbor. Remember, building connections takes time, and every small step counts. As we wrap up today's session, let's take a moment to review what we've covered and set some goals for the week ahead.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I feel like I have a better understanding of how to handle my negative thoughts now.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Jamie. We've covered a lot of ground today. We talked about the double standard technique and how you've been using it to challenge negative thoughts and develop self-compassion. We also discussed the importance of observing thoughts with curiosity and non-judgment and choosing which thoughts to engage with. And we explored your concerns about reaching out to your neighbor and how you can start with small gestures to build connection.\n\nPatient: Yeah, it's been a really helpful session. I feel more prepared to handle my thoughts and emotions now.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that, Jamie. As we discussed, practicing these techniques takes time and patience, but the more you use them, the more natural they'll become. For this week, let's set a goal related to each of the topics we covered. What do you think about continuing to practice the double standard technique and observing your thoughts with curiosity? And perhaps setting a goal to reach out to your neighbor in a small way, like saying hello or asking how they're doing?\n\nPatient: That sounds manageable. I can definitely keep practicing the double standard technique and observing my thoughts. And I'll try to say hello to my neighbor when I see them this week.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like great goals, Jamie. Remember, every small step counts, and it's okay if things don't go perfectly. The important thing is that you're making an effort and practicing these skills. And if you find yourself struggling with negative thoughts or emotions this week, try to observe them with curiosity and non-judgment and remind yourself that thoughts are not facts.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best. Thank you for all your support, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Jamie. I'm here to support you every step of the way. And remember, you've already made so much progress. You have the tools and the strength to continue moving forward. If you have any questions or concerns before our next session, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Practicing the double standard technique to challenge negative thoughts and develop self-compassion\n  - Observing thoughts with curiosity and non-judgment and choosing which thoughts to engage with\n  - Addressing concerns about reaching out to a neighbor and building social connections\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Double Standard Technique (ongoing): Jamie will continue practicing the double standard technique to challenge negative thoughts and develop self-compassion.
