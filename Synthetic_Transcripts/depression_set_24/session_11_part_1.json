  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like progressive muscle relaxation and reframing all-or-nothing thinking. I've noticed some improvement in my sleep, but I'm still struggling with low energy and motivation. I did manage to find my painting supplies and set up a space, but I haven't started painting yet.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and have noticed some improvement in your sleep. Setting up a space for painting is a significant step towards engaging with your hobbies again. Let's explore your struggle with low energy and motivation further. On a scale of 0 to 10, how would you rate your energy levels and motivation since our last session?\n\nPatient: I'd say my energy levels have been around a 4, and my motivation around a 3. I want to do more, but it feels like there's a weight holding me back.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. It's common for depression to make even small tasks feel overwhelming. Let's focus on your energy and motivation today. What else would you like to prioritize in our session?\n\nPatient: I'd like to discuss how I can start painting again, even with my low motivation. I also want to talk about my negative thoughts and how they're affecting my progress.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan. Let's add \"strategies for starting painting\" and \"addressing negative thoughts\" to our agenda. Is there anything else you'd like to include?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it for now.\n\nTherapist: Alright, so our agenda for today includes:\n1. Exploring your energy levels and motivation\n2. Strategies for starting painting\n3. Addressing negative thoughts\n\nLet's start by discussing your energy levels and motivation. You mentioned feeling like there's a weight holding you back. Can you tell me more about that feeling?",
