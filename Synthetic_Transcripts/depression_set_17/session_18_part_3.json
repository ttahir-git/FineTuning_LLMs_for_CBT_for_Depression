  "transcript": "Patient: I like the idea of having a wellness action plan. It makes me feel more prepared for the future.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Alejandro. Having a plan in place can provide a sense of control and confidence. Another helpful tool for maintaining your progress is creating coping cards. These are small, portable reminders of the adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs you've developed in therapy. They can be especially useful in moments when negative thoughts or feelings are intense.\n\nPatient: That sounds really helpful. What kind of things should I put on my coping cards?\n\nTherapist: Great question! You can include reminders of the evidence against your negative core beliefs, like the examples we discussed earlier. You can also write down coping statements, such as \"Thoughts are not facts\" or \"I am doing the best I can.\" Another idea is to create personalized affirmations or mantras that reinforce your new, more balanced beliefs about yourself.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. Maybe I could write something like, \"I am enough, just as I am\" or \"It's okay to prioritize my own needs sometimes.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are fantastic affirmations, Alejandro! They directly challenge your old core belief of \"I'm not good enough\" and support a healthier, more balanced perspective. You can write these affirmations on index cards or even create digital versions on your phone, so you always have them with you.\n\nPatient: I think I'll do both \u2013 write them on cards and put them in my phone. That way, I'll have them handy no matter where I am.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan! In addition to coping cards, another strategy for maintaining your progress is to practice being your own therapist. This means applying the CBT principles and techniques you've learned to new situations as they arise. One way to do this is to complete meta-thought records.\n\nPatient: What are meta-thought records?\n\nTherapist: Meta-thought records are thought records about the experience of CBT itself and the progress you've made. For example, if you find yourself feeling anxious about ending therapy, you could complete a thought record to examine the evidence for and against your anxiety-provoking thoughts. This helps reinforce the idea that you have the skills to manage your thoughts and emotions, even without the guidance of a therapist.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's like taking a step back and applying what I've learned to my own therapy experience.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! It's a way of consolidating your knowledge and building confidence in your ability to be your own therapist. Another helpful strategy is to role-play being the therapist while I play the role of the patient. This allows you to practice applying CBT techniques from a different perspective.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can try that. What would that look like?\n\nTherapist: Sure, let's give it a try. I'll start by expressing a negative thought, and you can guide me through the process of challenging it using the Evidence-Based Thinking technique. For example, I might say, \"I'm really worried that I won't be able to maintain my progress after therapy ends.\"\n\nPatient: Alright, and then I would ask you to provide evidence for and against that thought, right?\n\nTherapist: Exactly! You're already off to a great start. What evidence do you think might support the idea that you won't be able to maintain your progress?\n\nPatient: Well, you might say that you still sometimes struggle with negative thoughts and feelings, even after all the work you've done in therapy.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point. Even with progress, setbacks can happen. Now, what evidence might contradict the idea that you won't be able to maintain your progress?",
