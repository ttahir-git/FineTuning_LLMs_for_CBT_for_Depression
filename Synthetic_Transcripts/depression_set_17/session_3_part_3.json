  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you helping me reframe that thought. It feels more hopeful and less overwhelming when I look at it that way.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that reframing feels helpful for you, Alejandro. As we continue practicing this skill, it will become easier to catch and challenge negative thoughts in the moment. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about your goals for therapy. We've discussed some of the main challenges you're facing, such as work stress, family pressures, and negative thought patterns. What are some specific goals you'd like to work towards in our time together?\n\nPatient: One big goal is to find a better balance between supporting my family and taking care of myself. I want to feel less overwhelmed by my responsibilities and more in control of my life. Another goal is to figure out a long-term career plan, so I don't feel stuck in my current job forever.\n\nTherapist: Those are great goals, Alejandro. They align well with the themes we've been discussing, like managing stress, improving self-care, and cultivating a sense of purpose. Let's break these goals down into smaller, more specific objectives. For example, one objective related to finding balance could be setting boundaries around your work hours, so you have more time for self-care and hobbies. An objective related to career planning could be researching education or training programs that align with your interests. What do you think about those ideas?\n\nPatient: I like those ideas. Setting boundaries at work is something I've struggled with, but I know it's important. And researching education programs feels less daunting than trying to figure out my whole career path at once.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad those objectives resonate with you. We can start there and adjust as needed. Another important aspect of goal-setting is making sure our goals are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This helps us create clear, actionable plans and track our progress. For example, a SMART goal related to setting work boundaries could be: \"Within the next two weeks, I will have a conversation with my supervisor about limiting my overtime hours to no more than 5 hours per week.\" How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That makes sense. Having a specific goal like that feels more manageable than just saying I want to set boundaries. I think I can do that.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! We can work together to create SMART goals for each of your main objectives. As we progress through therapy, we'll regularly check in on your goals and adjust them as needed. Remember, therapy is a collaborative process, and your input is essential in shaping our work together. Do you have any questions or concerns about the therapy process so far?\n\nPatient: I don't think I have any major concerns. I'm just worried that I might not make progress as quickly as I'd like, or that I'll get discouraged if I have setbacks.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to have those worries, Alejandro. Therapy is rarely a linear process, and setbacks are often part of the journey. What's important is that we keep communicating openly and adjust our approach as needed. If you ever feel stuck or discouraged, please let me know so we can problem-solve together. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. That's reassuring to hear. I'll do my best to keep you in the loop about how I'm feeling and what I need.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your commitment to open communication, Alejandro. It will serve you well in therapy and beyond. Now, let's take a moment to check in on how you're feeling after our discussion today. What's standing out to you, and how are you feeling about the goals we've set?",
