  "transcript": "Patient: Last session, you gave me the homework of continuing to use my coping cards, practicing CBT skills, and reaching out to a support person. I have to admit, I struggled a bit with the last one. I'm not used to asking for help or sharing my feelings with others.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel uncomfortable reaching out for support, especially if it's not something you're used to doing. Can you tell me more about what made it challenging for you?\n\nPatient: Well, I come from a family where we don't really talk about our feelings. We just push through and keep going, no matter what. So, it feels weird to suddenly start opening up to people about my struggles.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense, Alejandro. Our family and cultural backgrounds can have a big influence on how we view asking for help and expressing our emotions. It's great that you're aware of this and can recognize how it might be impacting your ability to reach out for support. Did you manage to reach out to anyone, even if it felt uncomfortable?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I did. I ended up calling an old friend from high school who I haven't talked to in a while. We just caught up on life, and I didn't go into too much detail about my depression, but it felt good to connect with someone outside of my family and work.\n\nTherapist: That's a great step, Alejandro. Reaching out, even if it's just for a casual conversation, can help you feel more connected and supported. As we continue to work on challenging some of these beliefs around asking for help and expressing emotions, it might become easier to open up to others about your struggles when you feel ready.\n\nPatient: I hope so. I know I can't keep bottling everything up inside, but it's hard to break old habits.\n\nTherapist: You're right, changing long-standing patterns can be difficult, but it's not impossible. It takes practice and patience with yourself. Speaking of practice, how did you do with using your coping cards and practicing your CBT skills this week?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to use my coping cards whenever I start feeling overwhelmed or down. It helps to have those reminders of more balanced thoughts. And I've been working on catching my negative thoughts and challenging them with evidence-based thinking.\n\nTherapist: That's excellent, Alejandro. Consistently using these skills, even when it feels challenging, is key to managing your depression in the long run. Remember, the more you practice, the more automatic these new ways of thinking will become.",
