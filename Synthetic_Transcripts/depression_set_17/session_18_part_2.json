  "transcript": "Patient: When you put it that way, it's hard to come up with concrete evidence that I'm not good enough. I mean, I'm reliable, I work hard, and I care about my family. But in the moment, it just feels true.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alejandro. Feelings can be very powerful, but they aren't always based on facts. Let's look at the evidence that contradicts the core belief \"I'm not good enough.\" What are some examples of times when you've been \"good enough\" or even excelled?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been consistently promoted at work, even though I'm one of the youngest on my team. And my family often comes to me for advice or help with problems. I guess that shows they trust and value me.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Those are strong pieces of evidence against the core belief \"I'm not good enough.\" By focusing on facts rather than feelings, we can start to challenge and reframe this belief. \n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's just hard to remember in the moment, when the negative thoughts are so loud.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable. That's why we practice these techniques, so they become more automatic over time. Speaking of practice, how did the other homework assignments go? Were you able to schedule quality time with friends or family?\n\nPatient: I did, actually. I went out to dinner with a couple of friends from the neighborhood. It was nice to relax and catch up with them. But I still felt a little guilty, like I should have been helping my family instead.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you were able to make time for your friends, even though the guilt was still there. That's a great step towards balancing your own needs with your family responsibilities. Remember, taking care of yourself isn't selfish \u2013 it's necessary. Just like on an airplane, you need to put on your own oxygen mask before assisting others.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I never thought of it that way before.\n\nTherapist: It's a helpful metaphor to keep in mind. Now, let's discuss how you can continue to make progress after our sessions end. One strategy is to create a personalized \"toolbox\" of the CBT skills and techniques you've learned, so you can easily access them when needed. What are some of the tools you'd like to include?\n\nPatient: Definitely the thought records and coping cards. Those have been really helpful for me. And the Evidence-Based Thinking technique, too.\n\nTherapist: Great choices! It's also important to have a plan for maintaining your progress and managing potential setbacks. Let's call this your \"wellness action plan.\" What are some early warning signs that your depression might be worsening?\n\nPatient: I start isolating myself more, and I have trouble sleeping. I also tend to neglect my hobbies and self-care.\n\nTherapist: Those are important signs to watch out for. If you notice these warning signs, what are some steps you can take to cope?\n\nPatient: I can reach out to friends or family for support, even if I don't feel like it. And I can make sure I'm using my CBT tools, like thought records and coping cards, regularly.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! Reaching out for support and using your CBT tools are great strategies. Remember, setbacks are a normal part of the recovery process. They don't mean you've failed or that you're not good enough. They're just bumps in the road, and with your toolbox and wellness action plan, you have the skills to navigate them.",
