The conflict between prioritizing your own emotional needs and feeling like you need to be the strong, self-reliant one is a common struggle for many people. It's wonderful that you're recognizing how this dynamic might be impacting your depression. Let's explore this further. Can you think of a specific situation recently where you felt torn between taking care of yourself and meeting the expectations of your family or community?\n\nPatient: Yes, just last week my sister asked me to help her move some heavy furniture.
