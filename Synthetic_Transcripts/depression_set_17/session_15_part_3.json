  "transcript": "Patient: The downward arrow technique makes sense to me. I can see how it helps to uncover the deeper beliefs that are driving my negative thoughts. I'm willing to try it with an example from my own life.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start with a situation that triggered some negative thoughts for you recently. Can you describe the situation and the initial thought that came to mind?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I was supposed to meet some friends for dinner, but I canceled at the last minute because I was feeling overwhelmed and anxious. My initial thought was, \"I'm a terrible friend for canceling on them.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's use the downward arrow technique to explore that thought further. If it's true that you're a terrible friend for canceling on them, what would that mean to you?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not reliable or dependable.\n\nTherapist: And if you're not reliable or dependable, what would that mean?\n\nPatient: It would mean that my friends can't count on me when they need me.\n\nTherapist: And if your friends can't count on you when they need you, what would that mean?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not a good person and that I don't deserve their friendship.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your willingness to explore this further. We've reached a core belief here: \"I'm not a good person and I don't deserve their friendship.\" This belief seems to be fueling the negative thoughts and emotions you experienced when you canceled dinner with your friends.\n\nNow that we've identified this core belief, we can start to challenge it using the evidence we've gathered through our work together. For example, we can look at the progress you've made in setting boundaries with your family and practicing self-compassion as evidence that you are a good person who is working on taking care of yourself.\n\nWhat do you think about this core belief? Do you think it's an accurate reflection of who you are, or is it something we should work on reframing?\n\nPatient: I can see how this core belief is driving a lot of my negative thoughts and emotions. I don't think it's an accurate reflection of who I am, but it's hard to shake the feeling that I'm not a good person when I prioritize my own needs over others.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that it's hard to shake that feeling, especially when it's a belief that you've held for a long time. Reframing core beliefs is a process, and it takes time and practice. We can start by looking at the evidence that contradicts this belief and coming up with a more balanced and accurate belief to replace it.\n\nFor example, we could reframe the belief \"I'm not a good person and I don't deserve their friendship\" to something like \"I'm a good person who is learning to balance my own needs with the needs of others. My friends value me for who I am, even if I can't always be there for them.\"\n\nWhat do you think about that reframe? Does it feel more accurate and balanced to you?\n\nPatient: It does feel more accurate and balanced. I like the idea of learning to balance my own needs with the needs of others, rather than feeling like I have to choose one or the other.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Learning to find that balance is key to building and maintaining healthy relationships, both with others and with yourself. As we continue to work on reframing this core belief, we can explore more examples of how you can prioritize your own needs while still being a good friend and a good person.\n\nSpeaking of being a good friend, I'm curious about how your friends responded when you canceled dinner. Did you have a chance to talk to them about why you needed to cancel?\n\nPatient: I did talk to them later. They were understanding and said they hoped I was feeling better. They even offered to bring me some food if I needed it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how your friends value you and your well-being, even when you need to prioritize your own needs. Their response is more evidence that contradicts the core belief \"I'm not a good person and I don't deserve their friendship.\"\n\nAs you continue to practice self-compassion and challenge this core belief, it can be helpful to remember moments like this when your friends showed understanding and support for your needs.",
