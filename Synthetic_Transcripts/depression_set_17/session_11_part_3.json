  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start the downward arrow technique by focusing on the thought \"I'm not good enough.\" Alejandro, can you think of a specific situation where this thought comes up for you?\n\nPatient: One situation where this thought often comes up is when I'm at family gatherings. I see my cousins who have finished college and have successful careers, and I feel like I'm not measuring up because I had to leave college to work.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alejandro. Now, let's explore this further. When you have the thought \"I'm not good enough\" in this situation, what does that mean to you? What's the deeper meaning behind that thought?\n\nPatient: It means that I'm not living up to my potential, and I'm disappointing my family. I feel like I'm letting them down by not having a better career.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so there's a sense of disappointment and letting your family down. Let's keep going. If you're disappointing your family, what does that mean about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It means that I'm not a good son or a good role model for my younger siblings. I feel like I'm not fulfilling my duties to my family.\n\nTherapist: So, there's a belief that being a good son and role model is tied to your career success. Let's take it one step further. If you're not a good son or role model, what does that mean about your worth as a person?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel like I'm not valuable or worthy. Like I don't deserve to be happy or respected by my family.\n\nTherapist: Alejandro, thank you for being so open and vulnerable in sharing this. What we've uncovered through this process is a core belief that your worth as a person is tied to your career success and your ability to fulfill your perceived duties to your family. This belief is likely contributing to your feelings of depression and inadequacy.\n\nPatient: Yeah, it's really hard to shake that belief. It's been with me for a long time.\n\nTherapist: I understand, Alejandro. Core beliefs are often deeply ingrained and can be challenging to change. However, by identifying them, we can start to challenge and reframe them. Let's look at some evidence that contradicts this core belief. Can you think of times when you've felt valued or respected by your family, regardless of your career status?\n\nPatient: Well, there have been times when my family has thanked me for helping out with household chores or taking care of my grandparents. They've expressed appreciation for my hard work and dedication to the family.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Alejandro. Those moments of appreciation and gratitude from your family are evidence that your worth is not solely tied to your career success. Your family values your contributions and presence in their lives. Let's continue to gather evidence that challenges this core belief. Can you think of other situations where you've felt a sense of worth or accomplishment outside of your career?\n\nPatient: I do feel a sense of accomplishment when I cook a meal for my family, and they enjoy it. I also feel good when I'm playing soccer with my friends and I make a good play or help our team win.\n\nTherapist: Excellent examples, Alejandro. Those moments of accomplishment and joy in other areas of your life are further evidence that your worth is not solely defined by your career. As we continue to gather evidence and challenge this core belief, we can work on developing a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself.",
