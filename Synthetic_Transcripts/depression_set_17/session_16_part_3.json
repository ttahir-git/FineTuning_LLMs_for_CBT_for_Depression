  "transcript": "Patient: When I think about it, I guess there isn't much evidence to support that I'm being selfish. I do a lot for my family, and this was just one instance where I had other plans.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. Can you think of other evidence that contradicts the thought that you're being selfish?\n\nPatient: Well, I work long hours to help support my family financially. I often put their needs before my own. And I'm always there for them when they need me, even if it means sacrificing my own plans.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Those are significant pieces of evidence against the thought that you're being selfish. Now let's look at the thought \"I'm not good enough.\" What evidence do you have that challenges that core belief?\n\nPatient: It's harder to find evidence against that one because it feels so deeply ingrained. But I guess I could point to the fact that I'm a hard worker, I care about my family, and I try to be a good person.\n\nTherapist: Those are all great examples. Let's focus on the fact that you're a hard worker. What does that say about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It shows that I'm dedicated, responsible, and willing to put in effort to support myself and my family.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And what about the fact that you care about your family? What does that say about your character?\n\nPatient: It means I'm loyal, loving, and committed to the people I care about.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And what about your statement that you try to be a good person? What evidence supports that?\n\nPatient: I try to treat others with kindness and respect. I'm always willing to help out when I can. And I strive to do the right thing, even when it's difficult.\n\nTherapist: Those are all powerful examples that challenge the core belief that you're not good enough. Let's summarize the evidence against that belief: you're a hard worker, you care about your family, you treat others with kindness and respect, you're willing to help out, and you strive to do the right thing. How does it feel to hear that evidence stated back to you?\n\nPatient: It feels good to hear it laid out like that. It's a reminder that I have a lot of positive qualities, even if I don't always see them.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Now let's explore how we can reframe that core belief in a more balanced and realistic way. Instead of \"I'm not good enough,\" what would be a more accurate belief based on the evidence we've discussed?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like \"I have value and worth, even if I'm not perfect.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframed belief. It acknowledges that you don't have to be perfect to have value and worth. How does that belief feel compared to the original core belief?\n\nPatient: It feels more compassionate and realistic. It takes the pressure off of feeling like I have to be perfect to be good enough.\n\nTherapist: That's a great way to put it. As we continue to challenge these negative core beliefs, it can help to create a new narrative for yourself based on the evidence we've discussed. Let's practice using this reframed belief in the context of the situation with your sister. How could you have responded differently if you were operating from the belief \"I have value and worth, even if I'm not perfect\"?\n\nPatient: I think I would have been more confident in setting boundaries and asserting my own needs. I could have said something like \"I understand you need help, but I have plans with my friends tonight. I'm happy to help you find another time that works for both of us.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of setting a healthy boundary while still showing care for your sister's needs. How do you think that response would have impacted your emotions and behaviors in that situation?\n\nPatient: I think I would have felt less guilty and resentful. I would have been able to enjoy my time with my friends without feeling like I was letting my family down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. By challenging these negative core beliefs and operating from a more balanced perspective, we can start to shift our emotional and behavioral responses in a healthier direction. Does this feel like a helpful way to approach situations like this in the future?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think it's something I need to practice, but it feels like a healthier way to balance my own needs with the needs of my family.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal to work towards. As we continue to practice challenging these negative core beliefs and setting healthy boundaries, it will start to feel more natural over time. Remember that it's a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.",
