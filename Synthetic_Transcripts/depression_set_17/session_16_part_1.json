  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's great to see you again for session 16. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say, as I can't directly observe non-verbal cues. If you ever feel I've misunderstood you, please let me know so we can clarify. Lastly, I want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a mental health emergency, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services in your area.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations and appreciate your transparency. I'm happy to clarify if there's any confusion.\n\nTherapist: Thank you, Alejandro. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been feeling a bit better. I've been trying to use the coping cards and thought records when I notice negative thoughts creeping in. It's not always easy, but I think it's helping me to be more aware of my thought patterns. I did have a bit of a rough patch last week when I had a disagreement with my sister. It brought up some of those old feelings of not being good enough.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been finding the coping cards and thought records helpful, even if it's not always easy. It's great that you're building that awareness. I'm sorry to hear about the disagreement with your sister. Would you like to talk more about that and how it impacted your thoughts and feelings?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that would be helpful. It just brought up a lot of those old beliefs about not being good enough and feeling like I'm letting my family down.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, let's explore that further. Before we do, let's set an agenda for today's session. We can definitely prioritize discussing the situation with your sister and how it relates to your core beliefs. What else would you like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I'd also like to talk more about how to balance taking care of myself with supporting my family. And maybe we could review the downward arrow technique again? I tried using it on my own but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. So for our agenda, we'll prioritize:\n1. Exploring the situation with your sister and how it relates to your core beliefs\n2. Discussing strategies for balancing self-care with family obligations \n3. Reviewing and practicing the downward arrow technique\n\nDoes that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it. Let's start with the situation with my sister.",
