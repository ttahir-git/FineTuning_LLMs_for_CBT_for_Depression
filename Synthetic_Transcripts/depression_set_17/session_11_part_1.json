  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few limitations as your AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say, as I can't directly observe non-verbal cues. If you ever feel I've misunderstood you, please let me know so we can clarify. Lastly, if you ever experience thoughts of self-harm or suicide, it's crucial to seek immediate help from a qualified professional or emergency service, as I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being upfront about your limitations. I appreciate your support and guidance in our sessions.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alejandro. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have you noticed any changes in your mood or overall well-being?\n\nPatient: I've been feeling a bit better overall. I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like progressive muscle relaxation and setting small boundaries with my family. It's not always easy, but I think it's helping a little.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Alejandro. Even small improvements are a step in the right direction. Can you share a specific example of when you set a boundary with a family member and how it made you feel?\n\nPatient: Well, last week, my cousin asked me to help him move some furniture on my day off. Normally, I would have said yes without hesitation, but I remembered our discussion about self-care. I told him I needed some time to rest and recharge, and he understood. It felt a bit uncomfortable at first, but I also felt a sense of relief afterward.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example of setting a healthy boundary, Alejandro. It's natural to feel some discomfort at first, but the sense of relief you experienced afterward is a positive sign. It shows that prioritizing your own needs can lead to improved well-being. Let's keep exploring and practicing boundary-setting in our sessions.\n\nNow, let's set an agenda for today. Based on our last session and your current experiences, what would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I'd like to discuss more about challenging my negative thoughts, especially the belief that \"I'm not good enough.\" It's something that keeps coming up for me, and I want to work on reframing it.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Alejandro. Challenging negative core beliefs is an important part of our work together. We can definitely focus on that today. I'd also like to introduce the concept of cognitive distortions and explore how they might be contributing to your negative thoughts. Additionally, we can review your experiences with the homework assignments and discuss your progress with communication and boundary-setting within your family context. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to dive in.",
