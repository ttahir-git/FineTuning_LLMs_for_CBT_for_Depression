  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your experiences with the homework assignments. How did you find using the coping cards throughout the week?\n\nPatient: The coping cards were helpful, especially in moments when I started feeling overwhelmed or down on myself. Having those positive statements written down made it easier to challenge the negative thoughts that pop up automatically.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Can you give me an example of a specific situation where you used a coping card and how it helped you?\n\nPatient: Sure. There was one day when I was feeling really exhausted after work, but I had promised my little brother I'd help him with his homework. I started thinking, \"I'm too tired to be helpful. I'm just going to let him down.\" But then I pulled out the coping card that said, \"I am capable of handling challenges and supporting others, even when it's difficult.\" It reminded me that I don't have to be perfect to be a good brother and that my effort alone is valuable.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example, Alejandro. Using the coping card helped you challenge the negative thought and reframe the situation in a more balanced way. It's great that you were able to recognize your own effort and value, even in a moment of exhaustion. Did you find that using the coping card in that situation helped you follow through with helping your brother?\n\nPatient: Yeah, it did. I still felt tired, but I didn't feel as discouraged or hopeless about the situation. I ended up spending some time with my brother, and even though I wasn't at my best, I could tell he appreciated the help.\n\nTherapist: That's really important, Alejandro. You were able to see the positive impact of your actions, even if they weren't perfect. This is a great example of how challenging black-and-white thinking can help you engage in meaningful activities and relationships, even when it's difficult. Let's talk more about black-and-white thinking. Can you tell me about another situation this week where you noticed yourself engaging in this type of thinking?\n\nPatient: Well, there was a moment at work when I made a small mistake on a project. I started thinking, \"I always mess things up. I'm never going to be good at this job.\" It was like I went from one mistake to feeling like a complete failure.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alejandro. That's a clear example of black-and-white thinking, where one mistake leads to a sweeping negative judgment about yourself. Let's practice challenging this thought using a thought record. First, can you identify the emotion you were feeling in that moment and rate its intensity on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I was feeling really discouraged and frustrated with myself. I'd say the intensity was around 85.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write that down. Now, can you identify the evidence that supports the thought \"I always mess things up\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I've made mistakes at work before. And I didn't finish college, which feels like a big mess-up.\n\nTherapist: And what about evidence against the thought? Can you think of times when you've done well at work or handled challenges effectively?\n\nPatient: I mean, I've had positive feedback from my boss before. And I've been trusted with more responsibility over time. So, I guess there's evidence that I don't always mess up.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. It's important to recognize that one mistake doesn't define your entire performance or worth. Now, let's look for an alternative thought that takes both the evidence for and against the original thought into account. What's a more balanced way to view the situation?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I made a mistake, but that doesn't mean I'm a failure. I've had successes at work too, and one mistake doesn't erase those.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Alejandro. It acknowledges the mistake but puts it in perspective. Now, if you think about the situation with this alternative thought in mind, how intense are the feelings of discouragement and frustration?\n\nPatient: They're definitely less intense. Maybe more like a 50 now.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, Alejandro. By challenging the black-and-white thought and finding a more balanced perspective, you were able to reduce the intensity of the negative emotions. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the more naturally it will come. Let's keep working on identifying and challenging black-and-white thinking, both in our sessions and in your daily life.",
