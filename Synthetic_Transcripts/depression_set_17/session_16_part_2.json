  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's dive into the situation with your sister. Can you tell me more about what happened and what thoughts and feelings came up for you?\n\nPatient: Well, my sister asked me to help her with some repairs around her house. I told her I couldn't do it that day because I had plans with some friends. She got really upset and said that I'm never around to help the family anymore. It made me feel guilty, like I'm not doing enough for them.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a challenging situation. Let's explore the thoughts and feelings that came up. What was going through your mind when your sister said that?\n\nPatient: I started thinking that maybe she's right, that I'm being selfish by prioritizing my own needs over the family's. It brought up that old belief that I'm not good enough and that I'm letting everyone down.\n\nTherapist: I can understand how that would bring up those difficult thoughts and feelings. Let's look at this through the lens of the cognitive model. The situation was your sister asking for help and her reaction when you said you couldn't. The thoughts that came up were \"I'm being selfish\" and \"I'm not good enough.\" What emotions did you feel in that moment?\n\nPatient: I felt guilty, sad, and a bit angry at myself. I also felt frustrated because I feel like I'm always putting the family's needs before my own.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. So the emotions were guilt, sadness, anger, and frustration. And the behavior was that you ended up canceling your plans with your friends to help your sister, is that right?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I canceled my plans and helped her. But I felt resentful about it afterwards.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense. Let's look at the thought \"I'm being selfish.\" Is there evidence that supports that thought?",
