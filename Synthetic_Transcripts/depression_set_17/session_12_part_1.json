  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret your non-verbal cues, so please let me know if there's anything important I might be missing. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being transparent about your limitations. I feel comfortable continuing our sessions with this in mind.\n\nTherapist: Great, I appreciate your understanding. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been feeling a bit better. I've been trying to practice the techniques we've discussed, like the worry time and thought records. It's not always easy, but I think it's helping me manage my negative thoughts a bit better. However, I've still been struggling with balancing my family obligations and taking care of myself. I feel guilty when I prioritize my needs over my family's.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvement in managing your negative thoughts. It's also understandable that balancing self-care and family obligations remains a challenge. We can definitely explore this further today. How has your mood been in general?\n\nPatient: My mood has been relatively stable, with some ups and downs. I've had moments of feeling hopeful and motivated, but I also have times when I feel overwhelmed and hopeless, especially when it comes to my future and finding a sense of purpose.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alejandro. It's common to experience ups and downs, and we can work on developing strategies to manage those challenging moments. Let's set an agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to:\n\n1. Review your experiences with the homework assignments, including the positive data log\n2. Continue exploring and reframing the core belief \"I'm not good enough\" and its impact on your life\n3. Practice cognitive restructuring techniques to address cognitive distortions\n4. Discuss your progress with communication and boundary-setting within the family context\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think those topics cover the main areas I've been struggling with. I'd also like to discuss some strategies for managing the guilt I feel when I prioritize my own needs.",
