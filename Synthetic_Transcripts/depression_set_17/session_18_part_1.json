  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to use the Evidence-Based Thinking technique when I notice negative thoughts creeping in, and it has helped to some extent. However, I still find myself struggling with the core belief that \"I'm not good enough,\" especially when it comes to balancing my family obligations and taking care of myself.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the Evidence-Based Thinking technique and finding it helpful to some extent. It's understandable that the core belief \"I'm not good enough\" still poses a challenge, particularly when it comes to balancing family obligations and self-care. Let's explore this further today. How would you feel about setting an agenda for our session? We can collaborate on the priorities you'd like to focus on.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I think I'd like to focus on strategies for challenging the core belief \"I'm not good enough\" and finding ways to balance my family responsibilities with my own needs. I also want to discuss how I can continue to make progress after our sessions end, as I know we only have a couple of sessions left.\n\nTherapist: Those are great priorities to focus on, Alejandro. Let's start by exploring the core belief \"I'm not good enough\" and how it relates to balancing your family obligations and self-care. Can you share a recent situation where this core belief was triggered?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just last week, my family needed help with some home repairs, and I ended up spending my entire day off working on the house. I didn't get a chance to do anything for myself, like playing guitar or going for a bike ride, which I had been looking forward to. I felt guilty for even wanting to do those things when my family needed me.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Alejandro. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle, which explores the connections between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In this situation, what thoughts were going through your mind when you decided to spend your entire day off working on the house?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"If I don't help my family, I'm being selfish and not fulfilling my duty. They need me, and I can't let them down.\"\n\nTherapist: And how did those thoughts make you feel?\n\nPatient: I felt guilty, stressed, and a bit resentful, to be honest. I wanted to help my family, but I also wanted some time for myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a difficult position to be in, Alejandro. And how did those feelings influence your behavior?\n\nPatient: I ended up spending the whole day working on the house, even though I was exhausted and frustrated. I didn't assert my own needs or set any boundaries.\n\nTherapist: It's clear that the core belief \"I'm not good enough\" played a significant role in this situation, leading to thoughts of guilt and selfishness, which in turn influenced your feelings and behavior. Let's challenge this core belief using the Evidence-Based Thinking technique we've practiced before. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not good enough?",
