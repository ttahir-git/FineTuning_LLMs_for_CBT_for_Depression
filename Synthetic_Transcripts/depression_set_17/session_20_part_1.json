  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm committed to helping you to the best of my abilities within these constraints. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. I'm doing alright today, thanks for asking. It's been a busy week with work and family obligations, but I've been trying to make time for myself and use the coping strategies we've discussed.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been making an effort to prioritize self-care despite your busy schedule. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling since our last session? Have you noticed any changes in your mood or thought patterns?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to be more aware of my negative thoughts and challenge them using the evidence-based thinking skills we've practiced. It's not always easy, but I've noticed that I'm able to catch myself more often when I start spiraling into self-critical thoughts. I've also been using the coping cards we created, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed or stressed.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Alejandro. Recognizing and challenging negative thoughts is a crucial skill in managing depression, and it's great to see that you're applying what we've worked on together. Using the coping cards is also an excellent way to remind yourself of more balanced and compassionate ways of thinking. Let's take a moment to review some of the key points from our last session and then set an agenda for today. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I remember we talked about my progress with self-care and balancing my personal needs with family obligations. We also explored and reframed the belief that \"If I don't always put my family first, I'm being selfish and not fulfilling my duty.\" And we started discussing relapse prevention strategies.\n\nTherapist: You've got a great memory, Alejandro. Those were indeed some of the main topics we covered last time. For today's session, I thought we could start by reviewing your experiences with the homework assignments I gave you, including using coping cards, practicing CBT skills, and reaching out to a support person. We can then continue to explore and reframe the core belief \"I'm not good enough\" and the intermediate belief \"If I don't always put my family first, I'm being selfish and not fulfilling my duty.\" We'll also discuss your progress with self-care and balancing personal needs with family obligations, and practice additional relapse prevention strategies. Finally, we can start discussing plans for maintaining your progress after our therapy sessions come to an end. How does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or focus on today?\n\nPatient: The agenda sounds good to me. I'm particularly interested in discussing how to maintain my progress after therapy ends, as I'm feeling a bit anxious about not having these regular sessions to keep me on track.",
