  "transcript": "Patient: Practicing self-compassion felt a bit unnatural at first. I'm so used to being hard on myself, so speaking to myself with kindness and understanding felt foreign. But as I kept practicing, I started to feel a bit lighter, like a weight was lifting off my shoulders.\n\nTherapist: It's common for self-compassion to feel unnatural at first, especially if you're used to being self-critical. It's great that you noticed a feeling of lightness as you continued practicing. Can you share a specific situation where you used the self-compassion coping card and how it impacted your thoughts and emotions in that moment?\n\nPatient: One situation that comes to mind is when I made a mistake at work last week. I usually beat myself up for days after making a mistake, but this time, I pulled out my self-compassion coping card. It reminded me that everyone makes mistakes and that one mistake doesn't define my worth. I still felt frustrated with myself, but the intensity of the emotion was much lower than usual.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example of how using the self-compassion coping card can help reframe negative thoughts and reduce the intensity of difficult emotions. Recognizing that everyone makes mistakes and that one mistake doesn't define your worth is a powerful step in challenging the core belief \"I'm not good enough.\" Let's continue to build on this progress.\n\nNow, let's discuss the boundary-setting conversation you had with your sister. You mentioned feeling a mix of emotions afterward, including pride and guilt. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that accompanied those emotions?\n\nPatient: When I felt proud, I was thinking, \"I'm taking a step to prioritize my own needs, and that's a good thing.\" But then the guilt crept in, and I started thinking, \"I'm being selfish. My family needs me, and I'm letting them down.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing those thoughts. It's helpful to see how they connect to your emotions. The thought \"I'm taking a step to prioritize my own needs, and that's a good thing\" led to feelings of pride, while the thought \"I'm being selfish. My family needs me, and I'm letting them down\" led to feelings of guilt.\n\nLet's explore that second thought a bit more. What evidence do you have that setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs is selfish or that you're letting your family down?\n\nPatient: When I really think about it, I don't have much evidence to support that thought. My sister was understanding, and she's been more mindful of giving me space since our conversation. My family has always been there for me, and I know they want me to be happy and healthy.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. The evidence seems to contradict the thought that setting boundaries is selfish or that you're letting your family down. In fact, it sounds like your sister's response and your family's support suggest that setting boundaries is actually beneficial for your relationships.\n\nAs we continue to work on reframing the core belief \"I'm not a good person if I prioritize my own needs,\" it will be helpful to gather more evidence like this that challenges the belief. You can use a similar approach to the one we just practiced, examining the evidence for and against the thoughts that stem from this core belief.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and introduce a new cognitive restructuring technique called the \"downward arrow technique.\" This technique helps us uncover underlying intermediate and core beliefs by repeatedly asking, \"If that were true, what would that mean to you?\" For example, if we start with the thought \"I made a mistake at work,\" we might ask, \"If that were true, what would that mean to you?\" And you might respond, \"It means I'm not good at my job.\" We would then ask, \"If you're not good at your job, what would that mean to you?\" And so on, until we reach the underlying core belief.\n\nDoes this technique make sense? Would you like to try it together with an example from your own life?",
