  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like using thought records and coping cards. It's been challenging at times, but I do feel like I'm making some progress in challenging my negative core beliefs. However, I've also had some difficult moments, especially when it comes to balancing my own needs with my family obligations.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed and that you're noticing some progress. It's completely normal to have ups and downs throughout this process. Can you tell me more about the difficult moments you've experienced with balancing your needs and family obligations?\n\nPatient: Well, there was one instance where my sister needed help with her kids, and I had planned to spend some time with friends that evening. I felt guilty for even considering saying no, so I ended up canceling my plans. Afterwards, I felt frustrated with myself for not setting boundaries and prioritizing my own needs.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how our core beliefs can influence our thoughts and actions. In this case, your belief of \"I'm not good enough\" and the intermediate belief of \"If I don't always put my family first, I'm being selfish and not fulfilling my duty\" led you to prioritize your sister's needs over your own. Let's explore this further. What thoughts went through your mind when your sister asked for help?\n\nPatient: I immediately thought, \"I have to help her. If I don't, I'm being selfish and not fulfilling my duty as her brother.\" I also had the thought, \"My needs aren't as important as my family's needs.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts stem directly from your core and intermediate beliefs. Let's challenge them using the evidence we've gathered through our work together. What evidence do you have that contradicts the thought \"My needs aren't as important as my family's needs\"?\n\nPatient: Well, we've discussed how taking care of myself is important, and that I deserve to prioritize my own needs at times. I also know that constantly putting others' needs before my own has led to feelings of burnout and resentment.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! By acknowledging your own needs and setting boundaries, you're actually taking steps to be a better support system for your family in the long run. Let's reframe that thought to something more balanced, like \"My needs are just as important as my family's needs, and it's okay to prioritize myself at times.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's just hard to put it into practice when I'm in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable. It takes time and practice to change long-standing patterns of thinking and behavior. Let's set an agenda for today's session to help you continue making progress in this area.\n\nPatient: That sounds good.\n\nTherapist: Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to focus on the following topics today:\n1. Reviewing your experiences with the homework assignments, including the downward arrow technique and scheduling quality time with friends or family\n2. Continuing to explore and reframe the core beliefs \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'm a failure\"\n3. Introducing and practicing additional cognitive restructuring techniques to address other cognitive distortions\n4. Discussing your progress with communication and boundary-setting within the family context\n\nHow does that agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
