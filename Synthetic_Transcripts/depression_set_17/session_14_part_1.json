  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like using thought records and coping cards. It's been challenging at times, but I do feel like I'm making some progress in managing my negative thoughts and emotions. I still struggle with balancing my own needs with my family obligations, though.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on applying the techniques we've discussed, and that you're noticing some progress. It's understandable that balancing your own needs with family obligations remains a challenge. We can definitely explore that further today. Before we set our agenda, can you share a bit more about how your mood has been in general since our last session?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. I have moments where I feel more hopeful and motivated, especially when I'm able to challenge my negative thoughts successfully. But there are also times when I feel overwhelmed and drained, particularly after long shifts at work or when I feel like I'm not meeting my family's expectations. It's a constant battle in my mind.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience those ups and downs, especially as you're working on making changes in your thought patterns and coping strategies. The fact that you're noticing moments of hope and motivation is a positive sign. We can explore how to build on those moments and develop strategies for managing the times when you feel overwhelmed. Let's take a look at our agenda for today. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to:\n\n1. Review your experiences with the homework assignments, including the behavioral experiment\n2. Continue exploring and reframing the core beliefs \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'm not a good person if I prioritize my own needs\"\n3. Introduce and practice additional cognitive restructuring techniques to address other cognitive distortions\n4. Discuss your progress with communication and boundary-setting within the family context\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?\n\nPatient: That agenda covers the main areas I've been struggling with. I think it's a good plan for today's session. I'm particularly interested in discussing how to set boundaries with my family, as that's been a significant source of stress for me.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely prioritize discussing boundary-setting with your family. It's an important skill that can help you manage stress and prioritize your own well-being. Before we dive into that, let's start by reviewing your experiences with the homework assignments, particularly the behavioral experiment we planned. Can you share how that went and what insights you gained from it?",
