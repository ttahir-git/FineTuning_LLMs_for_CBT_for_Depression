  "transcript": "Therapist: It's understandable how those early experiences with your parents and past relationships have contributed to your core belief of being fundamentally flawed or unlovable. Our early experiences and relationships often shape the way we see ourselves and the world around us. However, it's important to recognize that these experiences do not define your worth or lovability. Let's explore this further. Can you think of any experiences or relationships in your life that challenge this core belief?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess my relationship with my sister, Mia, is different. She's always been there for me, even when we were kids. She's never made me feel like I was a burden or unlovable. And I have a few close friends who have stuck by me through tough times. I know they care about me, even if I don't always feel like I deserve it.\n\nTherapist: Those relationships with your sister and close friends are really important to acknowledge. They provide evidence that challenges your core belief of being unlovable. It's common for people with depression to discount or minimize positive experiences and focus on the negative ones, but it's crucial to recognize and give weight to the relationships and experiences that contradict your negative core belief. Let's try an exercise to help you start reframing this belief. I'd like you to think of a recent situation where you felt unlovable or flawed. What thoughts went through your mind in that moment?\n\nPatient: Last week, I made a mistake at work, and my boss pointed it out in a meeting. I felt embarrassed and started thinking that I was incompetent and that my boss and colleagues must think I'm an idiot.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's use this situation to practice reframing your thoughts and challenging your core belief. First, let's identify the cognitive distortions in your thinking. When you thought that your boss and colleagues must think you're an idiot, you were engaging in mind reading, assuming you knew what others were thinking without any concrete evidence. Additionally, calling yourself an \"idiot\" is an example of labeling, where you assign a global negative label to yourself based on a single incident. Does this make sense?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see how I was jumping to conclusions and being hard on myself.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against your thought that you're incompetent. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I did make a mistake, and my boss pointed it out in front of everyone.\n\nTherapist: Okay, that's one piece of evidence. Now, let's look at the evidence against this thought. What are some examples of times when you've been competent at work?\n\nPatient: I mean, I've been working there for years, and I've had a lot of successes. I've gotten good performance reviews, and I've been trusted with important projects. And even in this situation, I was able to fix the mistake and move forward.\n\nTherapist: Great. So, while you made a mistake, there is plenty of evidence that points to your competence and value in your job. When we look at the bigger picture, it becomes clear that one mistake does not define your overall competence. Now, let's try to reframe your original thought in a more balanced and compassionate way. Instead of thinking, \"I'm incompetent, and my boss and colleagues must think I'm an idiot,\" what could be a more realistic and adaptive thought?\n\nPatient: I guess I could think, \"I made a mistake, but everyone makes mistakes sometimes. One mistake doesn't mean I'm incompetent or unlovable. I'm human, and I'm still learning and growing.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic reframe, Alex. Acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes and that they do not define your worth is a significant step in challenging your core belief. As we continue to practice reframing your thoughts and gathering evidence against your negative core belief, you'll start to develop a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself. Remember, this process takes time and practice, but each small step counts. How do you feel about this exercise and the progress you're making?",
