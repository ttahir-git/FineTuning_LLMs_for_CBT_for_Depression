  "transcript": "Patient: Walking Luna has been really helpful. It gets me out of the house and I feel a sense of accomplishment after our walks. Drawing has been a bit more challenging. I often feel like I'm not good enough and that my artwork isn't meaningful.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that walking Luna has been beneficial for you. That sense of accomplishment is important, and it's a good example of how engaging in activities can positively impact your mood. Regarding drawing, it seems like you're experiencing some self-critical thoughts that may be hindering your ability to fully enjoy the activity. Can you tell me more about these thoughts?\n\nPatient: Well, I compare my artwork to others and feel like it's not as good. I also think that I should be spending my time on more \"productive\" activities, like work or household chores.\n\nTherapist: It's common for people to compare themselves to others and feel like they're not measuring up. This is a cognitive distortion called \"comparative thinking.\" The reality is that everyone has their own unique style and talents, and comparing yourself to others often leads to feelings of inadequacy. Additionally, the belief that you should only engage in \"productive\" activities is a type of \"should statement,\" which can create unnecessary pressure and guilt. Let's explore these thoughts further. Can you think of any evidence that contradicts these self-critical thoughts?\n\nPatient: I suppose that art is subjective, and what I find meaningful might not be the same for someone else. And just because something isn't considered traditionally \"productive,\" it doesn't mean it's not valuable or important for my well-being.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alex. Recognizing that art is subjective and that engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation is valuable for your well-being is an important step in challenging these self-critical thoughts. Remember, taking care of yourself and engaging in activities that promote positive emotions is essential for managing depression. Let's continue to practice challenging these thoughts using the thought record technique we've discussed previously.",
