  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I've been trying to pay more attention to the positive things that happen in my day-to-day life. For example, last week, one of my students came up to me after class and thanked me for being such a supportive professor. They mentioned how much they appreciated my approach to teaching and how it's helped them feel more confident in their studies. It felt really good to hear that, and it made me realize that maybe I'm not as flawed or unlovable as I sometimes think I am.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example, Alex. It's great that you were able to recognize and record that positive experience. How did it feel to challenge your core belief in that moment?\n\nPatient: It felt a bit strange at first, to be honest. I'm so used to focusing on the negative things that I often overlook the positive. But when I took the time to really think about what my student said, it made me feel more hopeful and less critical of myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Alex. Challenging our core beliefs can feel uncomfortable at first because we're so accustomed to thinking in a certain way. But as you continue to practice this, it will start to feel more natural, and you'll begin to see a shift in your overall perspective. I'm curious, were there any other situations where you found evidence that supports your new, more balanced core belief?\n\nPatient: Well, I also had a nice conversation with my neighbor the other day. We were both outside walking our dogs, and we ended up chatting for a while. It was just a casual conversation, but it made me realize that I am capable of connecting with people, even if it's just a small interaction like that.\n\nTherapist: That's another great example, Alex. These small interactions can be really powerful in helping us challenge our negative core beliefs. It's great that you're starting to recognize these moments and use them as evidence to support your new, more balanced belief about yourself. As we continue to work on this, you'll likely find that you have more and more experiences that support this new belief.\n\nPatient: I hope so. It's just hard sometimes because I feel like I have so much evidence to support my negative core belief, and it's hard to ignore that.\n\nTherapist: I understand, Alex. It's natural to feel that way, especially when we've been thinking in a certain way for a long time. But the more you practice focusing on the evidence that supports your new, more balanced belief, the easier it will become. It's a process, and it takes time, but you're making great progress.",
