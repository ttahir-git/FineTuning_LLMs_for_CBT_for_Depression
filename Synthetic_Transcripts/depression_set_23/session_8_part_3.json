  "transcript": "Therapist: Alex, let's practice using the self-compassion break technique during moments of overwhelm. Can you think of a recent situation where you felt overwhelmed while working on your artwork?\n\nPatient: Yes, just last week I was working on a piece for an upcoming gallery submission, and I started to feel really frustrated and anxious. I couldn't seem to get the colors right, and I started thinking that I wasn't good enough to be submitting my work to galleries.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a challenging situation. Let's use the self-compassion break technique to work through it. First, acknowledge the difficulty of the situation and your feelings. Can you try saying something like, \"This is a moment of suffering; I'm feeling frustrated and anxious right now\"?\n\nPatient: Okay, I can try that. \"This is a moment of suffering; I'm feeling frustrated and anxious right now.\"\n\nTherapist: Good. Now, remind yourself that suffering is a part of the human experience. Everyone faces challenges and difficulties. Can you say something like, \"Suffering is a part of life; I'm not alone in feeling this way\"?\n\nPatient: \"Suffering is a part of life; I'm not alone in feeling this way.\" It helps a little to know that other people struggle with similar feelings.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Recognizing the shared human experience can help you feel less isolated in your struggles. Finally, offer yourself some words of kindness and support. What would you say to a good friend who was feeling frustrated and anxious about their artwork?\n\nPatient: I would probably say something like, \"Be patient with yourself. You're doing your best, and that's all you can ask of yourself.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful expression of self-compassion. Can you direct those words towards yourself? \"I need to be patient with myself. I'm doing my best, and that's all I can ask of myself.\"\n\nPatient: \"I need to be patient with myself. I'm doing my best, and that's all I can ask of myself.\" It feels a bit strange to say that to myself, but I do feel a little better.\n\nTherapist: It can feel unfamiliar at first to practice self-compassion, especially if you're used to being self-critical. With practice, it will start to feel more natural. Remember, self-compassion is about treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a good friend.\n\nPatient: I'll keep practicing. It's helpful to have a specific technique to use when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find the self-compassion break technique helpful. As we continue to work on managing self-critical thoughts and overwhelming emotions, it's essential to practice these techniques regularly. The more you practice, the more automatic they will become.\n\nPatient: I understand. I'll make an effort to practice the self-compassion break and thought records more consistently.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Alex. Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks along the way. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alex. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Before we continue, I want to check in with how you're feeling about the techniques we've discussed so far. Do you have any questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: I don't have any questions at the moment. I'm feeling more hopeful about managing my self-critical thoughts and overwhelming emotions. It's reassuring to know that I have specific techniques to use when I'm struggling.",
