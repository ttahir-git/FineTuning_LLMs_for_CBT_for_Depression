  "transcript": "Patient: Reframing it that way makes it feel more achievable. It's not about giving up on my goals, but about being more realistic and kind to myself in the process.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Setting realistic standards is about finding a balance between striving for excellence and accepting that perfection is an unrealistic goal. It's about giving yourself permission to be human, to make mistakes, and to learn from them. What do you think might be a more realistic standard for the situation with the journal article?\n\nPatient: Instead of trying to make every sentence perfect, I could focus on making sure my main points are clear and well-supported. I can remind myself that the goal is to communicate my ideas effectively, not to write a perfect article.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of a more realistic and achievable standard. Focusing on communicating your ideas clearly and effectively, rather than getting every word perfect, can help reduce the pressure and anxiety around writing. How do you think you could remind yourself of this new standard when you find yourself getting caught up in perfectionism?\n\nPatient: I could write it down on a coping card, something like \"My goal is to communicate my ideas clearly, not to be perfect.\" I could also take breaks when I notice myself getting stuck on a particular sentence or section, and come back to it later with fresh eyes.\n\nTherapist: Those are both excellent strategies. Writing down the new standard on a coping card can help you challenge the perfectionistic thoughts in the moment, and taking breaks can help you gain perspective and avoid getting stuck in a loop of revising. Let's practice applying this new standard to another situation where you often experience perfectionism. Can you think of an example?\n\nPatient: I often feel pressure to be the perfect professor - to always be available to my students, to never make mistakes in my lectures, and to always have the right answers. It's exhausting, and I feel like I'm not living up to that standard.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, and a common experience for many professors. Let's apply the same process of setting a more realistic standard. What would a more achievable standard look like for you in this situation?\n\nPatient: A more realistic standard might be to be well-prepared for my lectures, but to accept that I might make mistakes or not always have the answers. And instead of being available to my students 24/7, I could set boundaries around my office hours and email response times.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like much more realistic and sustainable standards. Being well-prepared, but accepting that mistakes happen, and setting boundaries around your availability can help reduce the pressure and anxiety of trying to be the perfect professor. How do you think you could remind yourself of these new standards when you find yourself slipping into perfectionism?\n\nPatient: I could write these new standards down on a coping card, and review it before lectures or office hours. I could also practice self-compassion when I do make mistakes, reminding myself that it's okay to be human and that I'm doing my best.\n\nTherapist: Using a coping card and practicing self-compassion are both great strategies for challenging perfectionism and reminding yourself of your new, more realistic standards. It takes practice to change these long-standing patterns, but with time and repetition, it can get easier to catch those perfectionistic thoughts and challenge them with more realistic and compassionate ones.",
