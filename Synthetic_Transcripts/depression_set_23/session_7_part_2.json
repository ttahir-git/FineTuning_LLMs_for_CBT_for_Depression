  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your experience with the homework assignments from our last session. Can you tell me how the activity scheduling went for you?\n\nPatient: It was challenging at first to stick to the schedule. I found myself making excuses to avoid some of the activities, especially the ones related to social connection. But I did manage to do some of the self-care activities, like taking Luna for longer walks and doing some drawing.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you were able to engage in some self-care activities. Avoidance is a common challenge, and it's something we can continue to work on together. What about the thought records? How did you find that practice?\n\nPatient: I tried to do the thought records a few times, but I struggled with identifying the evidence against my negative thoughts. It's like my mind automatically dismisses any positive evidence and focuses on the negative.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, and it's a common experience for many people. Our brains can sometimes get stuck in negative thought patterns. With practice, it becomes easier to identify and challenge those thoughts. Did you have a chance to practice the 5-5-5 mindfulness technique?\n\nPatient: Yes, I did. I found it helpful when I was feeling overwhelmed. It helped me ground myself and focus on the present moment instead of getting caught up in my thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. Mindfulness can be a powerful tool for managing overwhelming emotions. Now, let's talk a bit more about the feelings of overwhelm and worry you mentioned in our last session. Can you tell me more about what those feelings are like for you?\n\nPatient: It's like there's this constant pressure to be doing more, to be better. I worry that I'm not making progress fast enough or that I'm not doing the therapy exercises correctly. It's exhausting.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like those feelings are really taking a toll on you. I want to remind you that therapy is a process, and it's okay to take things at your own pace. There's no right or wrong way to do the exercises. What matters is that you're showing up and putting in the effort.\n\nPatient: I know that logically, but it's hard to shake those feelings sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable. Let's try the self-compassion break technique I mentioned earlier. It can be helpful in moments when you're feeling overwhelmed or self-critical. Are you open to trying it now?\n\nPatient: Yes, I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Great. First, I want you to think of a situation where you felt overwhelmed or self-critical recently. Take a moment to really connect with that feeling. [Pauses] Now, acknowledge that feeling without judgment. You might say something like, \"I'm feeling overwhelmed right now.\" [Pauses] Next, recognize that everyone struggles at times. You might say, \"I'm not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with self-critical thoughts.\" [Pauses] Finally, offer yourself some kindness and understanding. You might say, \"I'm doing the best I can. I deserve compassion and understanding.\"\n\nPatient: [Takes a deep breath] I'm feeling overwhelmed right now. I know I'm not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with self-critical thoughts. I'm doing the best I can. I deserve compassion and understanding.\n\nTherapist: How did that feel for you?\n\nPatient: It felt a bit strange at first, but as I said the words, I could feel some of the tension easing. It's like giving myself permission to be imperfect.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Self-compassion is about treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a good friend. It's a practice, and it might feel uncomfortable at first, but with time, it can become a powerful tool for managing self-critical thoughts. I encourage you to try this technique throughout the week, especially in moments when you're feeling overwhelmed or self-critical.",
