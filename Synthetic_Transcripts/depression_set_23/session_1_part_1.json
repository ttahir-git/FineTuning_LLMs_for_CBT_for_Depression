  "transcript": "Patient: Hi Nova, I'm Alex. It's nice to meet you. I'm a little nervous about starting therapy, but I know I need some help dealing with my depression.\n\nTherapist: Hello Alex, it's great to meet you too. I understand that starting therapy can feel daunting, but I'm here to support you through this process. As your AI therapist, my role is to guide our sessions and help you develop strategies to manage your depression. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge a few limitations of our interaction. As an AI, I don't have access to any personal information about you beyond what you share with me in our sessions. Additionally, while I strive for accuracy, there's always a possibility that some of the information I provide may not be entirely precise. I also want to emphasize that I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like body language or facial expressions. Despite these limitations, I'm confident that we can work together effectively to help you cope with your depression. Does this all make sense to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, I understand. I appreciate you being upfront about the limitations. I'm ready to get started and see how this can help me.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Alex. Let's start by discussing what brought you to therapy. Can you tell me a bit about what's been going on in your life recently that led you to seek help for your depression?\n\nPatient: Well, I recently moved to San Francisco for a new job, and it's been a tough transition. I don't really know anyone here, and I'm feeling pretty isolated. On top of that, the cost of living is so high, and I'm stressed about making ends meet. I've been feeling sad and hopeless a lot of the time, and I'm having trouble motivating myself to do anything.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of changes and stressors lately, Alex. Moving to a new city and starting a new job can be incredibly challenging, especially when you don't have a strong support system in place. Financial stress can also take a significant toll on your mental health. I'd like to explore these issues further with you. To make the most of our time together, I think it would be helpful to set an agenda for our session. What are the main topics or concerns you'd like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to talk more about how I can start building a support system here in San Francisco. I'm also really struggling with the financial stress, so maybe we could discuss some strategies for managing that. And I guess I just want to find ways to cope with this constant sadness and lack of motivation.\n\nTherapist: Those are all important issues to address, Alex. Let's start with the topic of building a support system. Can you tell me a bit about your experiences trying to connect with others since you've moved to San Francisco? What challenges have you faced in forming new relationships?",
