  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your homework from last session. How did you find the process of scheduling self-care activities and using your coping cards?\n\nPatient: Scheduling self-care was challenging at first because I felt guilty for taking time away from work. But when I actually did the activities, like taking Luna for a long walk or reading a book for fun, I noticed that I felt a bit lighter and less stressed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. It's common to feel guilty about self-care at first, but noticing the positive impact on your mood is an important step. What about the coping cards? How did you find using those?\n\nPatient: The coping cards were helpful, especially when I started getting caught up in negative thoughts about not being good enough. Reading the statements reminded me that perfectionism is a distortion and that I'm doing my best.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the coping cards were helpful in managing those negative thoughts. It takes practice to catch those thoughts and challenge them, so using the cards is a great start. Let's look at your positive data log. Were you able to record any moments that contradicted your negative core belief?\n\nPatient: It was hard to recognize those moments at first, but I did write down a few. Like when a student thanked me for helping them understand a difficult concept, or when my sister told me she was proud of me. Those felt like evidence against the belief that I'm fundamentally flawed.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, those are perfect examples of evidence against your negative core belief. Recognizing and recording those moments is a crucial part of challenging and changing that belief over time. Great work on that.\n\nPatient: Thanks, it feels good to have some evidence against that harsh belief.\n\nTherapist: You've done a great job with your homework, and I can see how it's helping you challenge your negative thoughts and beliefs. Now, let's dive into discussing perfectionism and setting realistic standards. Can you tell me more about how perfectionism shows up in your life and the impact it has on you?\n\nPatient: Well, perfectionism shows up in most areas of my life - work, relationships, even hobbies. I set extremely high standards for myself, and if I don't meet them, I feel like a failure. It leads to a lot of stress, anxiety, and self-criticism.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience with perfectionism. Those high standards can lead to a lot of pressure and anxiety. Let's explore this further. What do you think is the origin of your perfectionism? When did you first notice it showing up in your life?\n\nPatient: I think it started in childhood. My parents had high expectations, and I felt like I needed to be perfect to earn their love and approval. I was always striving to get the best grades, be the best athlete, and never make mistakes.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense. Our early experiences and relationships can have a big impact on the beliefs and patterns we develop. It sounds like you learned early on that being perfect was the way to earn love and approval. How do you think this belief has impacted your life over time?\n\nPatient: It's led to a lot of stress and burnout. I've always pushed myself to be the best, but it's never felt like enough. I often feel like an imposter, like I'm not really as capable as people think I am. It's exhausting.\n\nTherapist: That constant pressure to be perfect can be exhausting, and it's a common experience for many people who struggle with perfectionism. The fear of being an imposter, or being \"found out,\" is also a common distortion that goes along with perfectionism. Let's look at how we can start to challenge and change these patterns. One strategy is to practice setting more realistic, achievable standards for yourself. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: It makes sense, but it feels scary. I'm so used to setting the bar high, and I worry that lowering my standards means I'm not trying hard enough.\n\nTherapist: That's a common concern, and it's understandable. Setting realistic standards doesn't mean lowering your effort or giving up on your goals. It's about recognizing that perfection is an unrealistic and unattainable standard, and that you can still strive for excellence without demanding perfection from yourself. What do you think about reframing it that way?",
