  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health and well-being. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the thought records and self-compassion break, but it's still challenging at times. I attended another LGBTQ+ support group meeting, which went well, but I still find myself setting unrealistic standards for myself.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed, even though it's been challenging. Attending the support group meeting is a great step forward. Let's explore those unrealistic standards you mentioned. Can you give me an example of a situation where you noticed yourself setting high expectations?\n\nPatient: Well, at work, I often feel like I need to be the perfect professor. I put a lot of pressure on myself to have all the answers and never make mistakes. If I don't meet these standards, I feel like a failure.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alex. It's common for individuals with perfectionistic tendencies to set such high standards for themselves. This can be linked to your core belief of being fundamentally flawed or unlovable. Let's add this to our agenda for today \u2013 we can work on reframing those unrealistic standards and developing more self-compassion.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I also wanted to discuss how I can continue supporting myself after our sessions end. I'm a bit anxious about not having this regular support.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's a great point. We can definitely discuss strategies for maintaining your progress and managing potential setbacks after our sessions conclude. It's normal to feel some anxiety about this transition. We'll work on creating a plan that feels supportive and manageable for you.\n\nPatient: Thank you, that would be really helpful.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. So, for our agenda today, we have:\n1. Reviewing your experience with the homework assignments (thought records, Positive Data Log, coping statements)\n2. Continuing to practice CBT techniques and exploring your progress and challenges\n3. Reframing unrealistic standards and developing self-compassion\n4. Discussing strategies for supporting yourself after therapy ends\n\nDoes this sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
