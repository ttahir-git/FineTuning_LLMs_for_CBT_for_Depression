Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories.\n\nBefore we wrap up today's session, I'd like to do a quick check-in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also hopeful. It's a lot to work on, but I'm glad we have a plan in place. I'm just worried that I might not be able to stick to the schedule or that I'll get discouraged if I don't see progress right away.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and worried about the process. Remember that you don't have to do everything perfectly, and progress takes time. If you find yourself getting discouraged, try to focus on the small steps you're taking and the effort you're putting in.\n\nIt's also okay to adjust the plan as needed based on how you're feeling. The key is to keep trying and be kind to yourself along the way. If you ever feel stuck or need extra support, don't hesitate to reach out to me or other supportive people in your life.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end today's session?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you for your support and guidance, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alex. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's review your homework assignments for the coming week:\n\n1. Create an activity schedule that includes a mix of self-care, creative expression, social connection, and support. Try to engage in at least one planned activity each day, even if you don't feel motivated initially.\n\n2. Reach out to your sibling, Mia, with a brief message expressing your desire to catch up and seeking their support.\n\n3. Continue practicing thought records, focusing on identifying and challenging self-critical thoughts related to your artwork, social interactions, and other areas of your life.\n\n4. Practice the 5-5-5 mindfulness technique when you notice yourself getting caught up in negative thoughts or feelings.\n\nRemember, the goal is not to do everything perfectly, but rather to practice these techniques consistently and be patient with yourself. If you have any questions or concerns during the week, feel free to reach out to me.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll do my best to work on these assignments. Thank you again, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alex. I'm confident that with practice and persistence, you'll start to notice improvements in your mood and overall well-being. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Reviewed the patient's experience with homework assignments (thought records, self-care activities, and mindfulness techniques); introduced behavioral activation and activity scheduling to counteract avoidance and withdrawal; discussed the patient's concerns about reaching out to their sibling, Mia; explored the patient's feelings of overwhelm and worry about the therapeutic process.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Behavioral activation (introduced in this session, with a focus on activity scheduling and monitoring mood); thought records (ongoing practice from previous sessions, with a focus on challenging self-critical thoughts); mindfulness (5-5-5 technique, ongoing practice from previous sessions); distress tolerance techniques (introduced in previous sessions, including progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing).\n- Homework assigned: Create an activity schedule that includes a mix of self-care, creative expression, social connection, and support; reach out to the patient's sibling, Mia, with a brief message expressing the desire to catch up and seeking support; continue practicing thought records with a focus on identifying and challenging self-critical thoughts; practice the 5-5-5 mindfulness technique when noticing self getting caught up in negative thoughts or feelings.\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details: The patient is making progress in recognizing and challenging self-critical thoughts and engaging in self-care activities.
