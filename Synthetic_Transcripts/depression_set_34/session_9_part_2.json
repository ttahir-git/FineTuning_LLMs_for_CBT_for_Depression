  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your homework from last session. How did you find the process of keeping a positive data log to challenge your core belief of not being good enough?\n\nPatient: It was really hard at first. I struggled to think of any evidence that contradicts that belief. But I did manage to write down a few things, like when one of my dance students told me how much they enjoy my classes and how I've helped them improve.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of evidence against your core belief. How did it feel to record that in your positive data log?\n\nPatient: It felt good in the moment, but then I started doubting it. I thought, \"They're just being nice\" or \"They don't really mean it.\" It's hard for me to accept compliments or positive feedback.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience, especially when we hold deeply ingrained negative beliefs about ourselves. Our minds often try to dismiss or minimize evidence that doesn't fit with those beliefs. This is known as the cognitive distortion of discounting the positive. \n\nOne way to challenge this distortion is to imagine what you would say to a friend in a similar situation. If your friend received a genuine compliment from someone they taught, would you tell them to dismiss it or would you encourage them to accept it as evidence of their skills and value?\n\nPatient: I would definitely tell my friend to accept the compliment and believe in themselves. It's interesting how I can give that advice to others but struggle to apply it to myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. It's often easier to show compassion and understanding to others than to ourselves. Recognizing that double standard is an important step in challenging negative core beliefs.\n\nLet's look at another entry from your positive data log. Can you share another piece of evidence you recorded that goes against the belief that you're not good enough?",
