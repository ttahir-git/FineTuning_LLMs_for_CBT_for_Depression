  "transcript": "Patient: Another piece of evidence I recorded was when I managed to get through a whole day without crying or feeling overwhelmed. It was a small victory, but it made me think that maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant accomplishment, Jamie, and it's great that you recognized it as evidence against your core belief. Being able to get through a day without crying or feeling overwhelmed is a sign of resilience and inner strength. It might seem like a small victory, but it's actually a big step forward in your recovery process.\n\nLet's explore this a bit further. What do you think enabled you to have a day without crying or feeling overwhelmed? Were there any specific thoughts, behaviors, or coping strategies that helped you?\n\nPatient: I think it was a combination of things. I made sure to get out of bed and take a shower, even though I didn't feel like it. I also reached out to a friend and talked to them about how I was feeling, which helped me feel less alone. And I tried to challenge some of my negative thoughts when they came up, like reminding myself that having a bad day doesn't mean I'm a failure.\n\nTherapist: Those are all really effective coping strategies, Jamie. Getting out of bed and taking a shower, even when you don't feel like it, is a form of behavioral activation. It helps you break the cycle of inactivity and low mood. Reaching out to a friend for support is another great way to combat feelings of isolation and hopelessness. And challenging your negative thoughts is a key skill in CBT that you've been working on.\n\nIt's important to recognize that you have the power to influence your mood and thoughts through your actions and coping strategies. Even small changes can make a big difference in how you feel. This is a great example of how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected.\n\nPatient: I never really thought about it that way before. It's empowering to know that I have some control over my mood, even if it doesn't always feel like it.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jamie. That's one of the core principles of CBT - that we have the power to change our thoughts and behaviors, which in turn can improve our mood and overall well-being. It's not always easy, but with practice and persistence, it's possible to make lasting changes.\n\nI'm curious, how did it feel to challenge your negative thoughts when they came up? Was it difficult to do in the moment?\n\nPatient: It was definitely challenging. My negative thoughts can be so loud and persistent that it's hard to argue against them. But I tried to remember what we've been working on in therapy, like looking for evidence against my negative thoughts and coming up with alternative explanations.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you were able to apply the skills we've been working on, even though it was challenging. Challenging negative thoughts takes practice, and it's not always easy to do in the moment. But the more you do it, the easier it becomes.\n\nOne strategy that can be helpful is to come up with some go-to phrases or mantras that you can use when you're struggling with negative thoughts. For example, you could tell yourself something like, \"Thoughts are not facts,\" or \"I am doing the best I can right now.\" Having these phrases ready can make it easier to challenge negative thoughts in the moment.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I think having some go-to phrases could be really helpful, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed by my thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Let's brainstorm a few phrases together that you think could be helpful for you. What are some things you could tell yourself when you're struggling with negative thoughts about yourself or your situation?\n\nPatient: I could tell myself something like, \"I am worthy of love and respect, no matter what my thoughts say,\" or \"Having struggles doesn't mean I'm a failure, it means I'm human.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are both really powerful and affirming phrases, Jamie. Writing them down and keeping them somewhere accessible, like on your phone or a sticky note on your mirror, can make it easier to remember them when you need them.\n\nAnother strategy that can be helpful is to imagine what you would say to a friend who was struggling with similar thoughts. Often, we're much kinder and more compassionate to others than we are to ourselves. Trying to extend that same kindness and compassion to yourself can be a powerful way to challenge negative thoughts.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I would never tell a friend that they're a failure or not good enough, so why do I say those things to myself?\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. We often hold ourselves to much higher and more unrealistic standards than we do others. Learning to treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would extend to a friend is an important part of building self-compassion and challenging negative core beliefs.\n\nAs we continue to work on challenging your negative thoughts and core beliefs, remember that it's a process and it takes time. There will be ups and downs, but every small step you take is a move in the right direction.",
