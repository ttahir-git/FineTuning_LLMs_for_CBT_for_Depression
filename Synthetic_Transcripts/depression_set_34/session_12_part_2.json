  "transcript": "Patient: I agree, setting an agenda for today's session is a good idea. In addition to discussing the negative thoughts I experienced and my progress with the homework, I'd also like to talk about how my cultural background and family expectations might be influencing my thoughts and beliefs. It's something I've been thinking about more since our last session.\n\nTherapist: That's a great topic to explore, Jamie. Our cultural background and family expectations can have a significant impact on our thoughts, beliefs, and how we perceive ourselves. Let's start by reviewing your homework from the previous session. How did you find the process of working on your positive data log and practicing reframing negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: The positive data log was helpful in making me more aware of the moments when I challenge my core belief of not being good enough. It was encouraging to see the evidence written down. However, I struggled with consistently reframing my negative thoughts. I found myself getting caught up in the negativity and sometimes forgetting to use the techniques we discussed.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you found the positive data log helpful in recognizing moments when you challenge your core belief. Building that awareness is an essential step in the process. It's also common to face challenges when trying to reframe negative thoughts, especially when you've been dealing with them for a long time. The fact that you're noticing when you get caught up in the negativity is a sign of progress. Can you share an example of a situation where you found it challenging to reframe a negative thought?\n\nPatient: One situation that comes to mind is when I had to cancel a dance class at the last minute because I wasn't feeling well. My initial thought was, \"I'm letting my students down, and they'll think I'm unreliable.\" I tried to reframe it by reminding myself that everyone gets sick sometimes and that my students would understand, but the negative thought kept lingering.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Jamie. When we're dealing with negative thoughts that are tied to our core beliefs, it can be challenging to reframe them in the moment. One technique that might be helpful in this situation is the \"evidence for and against\" approach. Let's break down the evidence for and against the thought that your students will think you're unreliable. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess the evidence that supports the thought is that I have had to cancel classes in the past due to my depression, and I worry that my students might be getting frustrated with me.\n\nTherapist: Okay, that's valid. Now, let's look at the evidence against this thought. Have your students expressed understanding or support when you've had to cancel classes in the past? Have they continued to attend your classes despite the occasional cancellations?\n\nPatient: When I think about it, my students have been very understanding. They often send me messages wishing me well when I'm not feeling well. And yes, they do continue to attend my classes and even recommend them to their friends.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that your students will think you're unreliable. By weighing the evidence for and against the negative thought, we can start to develop a more balanced perspective. Another technique that might be helpful is to consider alternative explanations for the situation. Could there be other reasons why you had to cancel the class, aside from being unreliable?\n\nPatient: Well, the main reason was that I wasn't feeling well. It wasn't something I could control, and I needed to prioritize my health.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Recognizing that there are valid reasons for your actions, beyond the negative explanation your mind initially jumps to, can help you develop a more compassionate and understanding view of yourself. As we continue to practice these techniques, it will become easier to challenge negative thoughts in the moment. Now, let's shift our focus to how your cultural background and family expectations might be influencing your thoughts and beliefs. Can you share more about your experiences growing up and how they might be impacting your current struggles?",
