  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can walk you through my thought record. So, on most days, I noticed that I had a lot of negative thoughts, especially in the mornings when I was trying to get motivated to start my day. Thoughts like \"I'm going to fail at everything today\" or \"I'm not good enough to be teaching others.\" \n\nOn the day I canceled my classes, I remember thinking \"My students deserve a better teacher\" and \"I'm letting everyone down by not showing up.\" Those thoughts made me feel really guilty and ashamed, which just made it harder to get out of bed.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. I can see how those negative thoughts would make it challenging to face the day and lead your classes. The thoughts you've identified, like \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'm letting everyone down,\" are great examples of what we call cognitive distortions in CBT.\n\nCognitive distortions are inaccurate or exaggerated thought patterns that can contribute to negative emotions and behaviors. Some common types include all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, and disqualifying the positive.\n\nIn your case, Jamie, it sounds like you might be engaging in all-or-nothing thinking when you say \"I'm going to fail at everything today.\" This type of thinking doesn't leave room for the possibility that you could have some successes or positive experiences, even if the day isn't perfect.\n\nAnother distortion I'm noticing is mind-reading, where you assume you know what others are thinking. For example, when you think \"My students deserve a better teacher,\" you're assuming that your students are judging you negatively, without any concrete evidence.\n\nDoes this make sense, Jamie? Can you see how these thought patterns might be influencing your emotions and behaviors?",
