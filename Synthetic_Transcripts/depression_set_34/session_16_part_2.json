  "transcript": "Patient: When I think about evidence against the belief that I'm not good enough, I guess I can point to my dance classes and the positive feedback I've received from my students and their parents. They often tell me how much they enjoy my classes and how I've helped them grow as dancers. But it's hard for me to believe that praise because I feel like I'm just meeting the bare minimum expectations.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of evidence against your core belief, Jamie. It shows that you have a positive impact on your students and their parents appreciate your work. The fact that you're able to help them grow as dancers is a testament to your skills and abilities. However, I notice that you tend to dismiss or minimize this evidence by saying that you're just meeting bare minimum expectations. This could be an example of the cognitive distortion called \"disqualifying the positive,\" where you reject positive experiences or feedback as if they don't count. Let's explore this further. What do you think are the \"bare minimum expectations\" for a dance teacher?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the bare minimum would be showing up to class, teaching the choreography, and making sure the students are safe. But I feel like I should be doing more, like connecting with each student individually, helping them overcome their challenges, and inspiring them to reach their full potential.\n\nTherapist: It's admirable that you have high standards for yourself as a dance teacher. However, it's also important to recognize that what you consider \"bare minimum\" is actually a solid foundation for effective teaching. Showing up, teaching choreography, and ensuring student safety are essential components of being a good dance teacher. The fact that you're also connecting with students, helping them overcome challenges, and inspiring them is going above and beyond those basic expectations. Can you see how your standards for yourself might be unrealistically high?\n\nPatient: I guess you're right. When I put it that way, it does seem like I'm expecting too much from myself. But it's hard to shake the feeling that I should be doing more, especially when I compare myself to other dance teachers who seem to have it all together.\n\nTherapist: Comparing ourselves to others can often fuel feelings of inadequacy and reinforce the belief that we're not good enough. Remember that everyone has their own unique strengths and challenges, and it's not fair to compare our behind-the-scenes to someone else's highlight reel. Instead of comparing yourself to others, let's focus on your own growth and progress. Can you think of a time when you felt proud of yourself as a dance teacher, even if it wasn't perfect?\n\nPatient: There was this one time when I was working with a student who was really struggling with a particular dance move. I spent some extra time with her after class, breaking down the steps and encouraging her to keep trying. Eventually, she got it, and the look of pride on her face made me feel like I had really made a difference for her.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example of your strengths as a dance teacher, Jamie. You showed patience, dedication, and the ability to break down complex moves into manageable steps. Most importantly, you made a positive impact on your student's confidence and growth. This is strong evidence against the belief that you're not good enough. Let's add this to your positive data log, which is a record of experiences and feedback that challenge your negative core beliefs.",
