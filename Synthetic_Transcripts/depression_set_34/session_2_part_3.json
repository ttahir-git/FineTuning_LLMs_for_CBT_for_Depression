  "transcript": "Patient: Yes, I can see how those distorted thoughts are affecting me. It's like I get stuck in this negative spiral where one bad thought leads to another, and before I know it, I'm feeling completely overwhelmed and hopeless.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Recognizing these negative thought spirals is an important first step in learning how to interrupt them. One strategy we can use is called \"thought challenging,\" where we examine the evidence for and against a particular thought and try to come up with a more balanced perspective.\n\nFor example, let's take the thought \"I'm not good enough to be teaching others.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought? And what evidence do you have that contradicts it?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the evidence that supports it is that I sometimes cancel classes and I'm not always as prepared as I'd like to be. But the evidence against it... I mean, I do have a lot of happy students who keep coming back to my classes. And I've been teaching for several years now, so I must be doing something right.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! It's important to look at the full picture, rather than just focusing on the negative aspects. Another helpful question to ask yourself is, \"What would I say to a friend who was having this thought?\" Often, we're much kinder and more understanding with others than we are with ourselves.\n\nPatient: That's true. If a friend came to me with these thoughts, I'd probably remind them of all their accomplishments and tell them that everyone has off days sometimes. I guess I need to learn to extend that same compassion to myself.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jamie. Self-compassion is a crucial part of managing depression. As we continue working together, we'll explore more strategies for challenging negative thoughts and cultivating a more balanced and self-compassionate mindset.\n\nSpeaking of our work together, I'd like to start discussing some potential goals for our therapy sessions. You mentioned in our last session that you'd like to develop a healthier relationship with your emotions, establish a consistent self-care routine, improve boundary-setting, explore the impact of cultural identity on mental health, and cultivate self-worth and self-compassion. These are all great goals, and I think they align well with the CBT framework.\n\nWhat do you think about starting with a goal related to challenging negative thoughts and increasing self-compassion? We could set a specific, measurable goal, like practicing thought challenging for 10 minutes a day, or engaging in one self-compassionate activity per day. What are your thoughts on that?",
