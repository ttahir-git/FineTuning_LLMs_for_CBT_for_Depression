  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's good to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I want you to feel comfortable correcting me if I misunderstand something. Additionally, as an AI, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, it's essential to reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so I encourage you to express your thoughts and feelings as openly as possible. With that said, how have you been since our last session? Can you share how your mood has been and if there have been any significant changes or experiences?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've had some ups and downs. I had a couple of days where I felt a bit more motivated and was able to engage in some activities I enjoy, like going for a hike. But there were also days where I struggled to get out of bed and felt overwhelmed by negative thoughts. I tried to use some of the techniques we've discussed, like reframing my thoughts, but it's still challenging at times.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you had some moments of motivation and were able to engage in enjoyable activities. It's also understandable that you experienced some challenging days. The ups and downs are a normal part of the process, and it's great that you're continuing to practice the techniques we've discussed. Can you share more about the negative thoughts you experienced and how you tried to reframe them?\n\nPatient: One recurring thought was that I'm not making enough progress and that I should be further along in my recovery. I tried to remind myself that progress isn't always linear and that I'm doing the best I can, but it's hard to shake that feeling of not being good enough.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Recognizing those negative thoughts and attempting to reframe them is an important step. It's common for people to have expectations about their recovery timeline, but as you mentioned, progress isn't always linear. Each small step you take is significant, and it's essential to acknowledge and celebrate those moments. What do you think about setting an agenda for today's session? We could explore the negative thoughts you experienced and continue working on reframing them, as well as discuss your progress with the homework assignments. Are there any other topics you'd like to prioritize today?",
