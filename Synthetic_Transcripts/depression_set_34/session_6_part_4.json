Recognizing your value as a friend and challenging feelings of guilt around relying on others is an important step in building healthier relationships and improving your overall well-being. As we wrap up today's session, let's take a moment to check in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better after talking through these issues. It's helpful to have a different perspective on my financial stress and friendships. I know it'll take time and practice to change these thought patterns, but I feel a bit more hopeful about it now.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Jamie. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and it's normal to have ups and downs. The important thing is that you're continuing to engage in the process and apply the skills we've discussed. Before we end today, let's talk about homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing the mindfulness and grounding techniques we've discussed, particularly when you notice yourself getting caught up in anxious thoughts about finances or feeling guilty about relying on friends. I also want you to keep using the thought records to challenge negative thoughts related to self-worth and success. Finally, I encourage you to have an open and honest conversation with a trusted friend about the feelings of guilt you've been experiencing. Does this sound manageable for you?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think I can do that. I'll try to be more mindful of my thoughts and practice challenging them. And I'll see if I can talk to my friend Alex about how I've been feeling.\n\nTherapist: That sounds great, Jamie. I'm confident that with continued practice and support, you'll start to see improvements in your mood and relationships. Remember that I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's plan to meet again next week to review your progress and continue our work together.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll see you next week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Managing financial stress, challenging negative thoughts related to self-worth and success, addressing feelings of guilt around relying on friends for support\n- Techniques or exercises used: \n  - Behavioral activation: Engaging in planned activities like hiking and reading before bed to counteract avoidance and withdrawal.
