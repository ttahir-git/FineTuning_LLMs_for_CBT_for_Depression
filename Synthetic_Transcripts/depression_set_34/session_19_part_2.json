  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I'm particularly interested in discussing the relapse prevention plan more, as I'm feeling a bit anxious about ending therapy and maintaining my progress on my own.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, and it's completely normal to feel some anxiety about ending therapy. We'll definitely spend some time refining your relapse prevention plan and discussing strategies for maintaining your progress. \n\nBefore we dive into that, let's start by reviewing your homework from last week. How did you find working on the thought records and positive data log?\n\nPatient: The thought records were challenging at first, but I found them helpful in managing my negative thoughts. I noticed that I was able to catch myself falling into old patterns more quickly and challenge those thoughts in the moment. The positive data log was a nice balance, as it helped me focus on the good things, even if they felt small.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. It's great that you're noticing the benefits of using the thought records in real-time. Being able to catch and challenge negative thoughts as they occur is a crucial skill. And I'm glad the positive data log is helping you balance your perspective. \n\nWere there any particular situations or thoughts that were more challenging to work through?\n\nPatient: One situation that stands out is when I had a disagreement with a friend. I noticed myself falling into the \"should\" trap, thinking \"I should have handled that better\" and \"I shouldn't have let my emotions get the best of me.\" It took me a bit longer to work through those thoughts and find a more balanced perspective.\n\nTherapist: Disagreements with friends can be particularly challenging, as they often bring up strong emotions and self-critical thoughts. It's great that you were able to recognize the \"should\" statements and work through them, even if it took a bit longer. \n\nWhat strategies did you find helpful in challenging those thoughts?\n\nPatient: I found it helpful to ask myself questions like \"Is this thought helpful?\" and \"What would I say to a friend in this situation?\" It allowed me to take a step back and view the situation from a different angle. I also reminded myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that one disagreement doesn't define our entire friendship.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent strategies. Asking yourself questions to gain perspective and considering how you would support a friend in a similar situation can be incredibly powerful. And recognizing that one disagreement doesn't define a friendship is a significant insight. \n\nI'm curious, how did you feel after working through those thoughts?\n\nPatient: After working through the thoughts, I felt a sense of relief and a bit more at peace with the situation. I was able to apologize to my friend without being too hard on myself and we were able to move forward.\n\nTherapist: That's a great outcome. Being able to apologize and move forward without being overly self-critical is a sign of emotional maturity and a balanced perspective. It's wonderful that you were able to apply the skills we've been practicing in a challenging interpersonal situation.\n\nNow, let's take a look at the draft of your relapse prevention plan. What early warning signs of depression have you identified?",
