  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing the Positive Data Log. Can you share with me any challenges you faced while trying to complete it?\n\nPatient: Well, like I mentioned earlier, I had trouble thinking of any evidence that contradicts my negative beliefs. I feel like everything in my life right now is just confirming that I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it can be challenging to find evidence against such a deeply held belief, especially when you're feeling low. Let's break it down a bit. Can you give me an example of a situation where you felt like you weren't good enough?\n\nPatient: Sure. The other day, I was teaching a dance class, and I felt like I wasn't explaining the steps clearly enough. Some of the students seemed confused, and I could tell they were getting frustrated. It made me feel like I'm not a good teacher.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. Now, let's try to look at it from a different perspective. Is it possible that the students' confusion had nothing to do with your teaching abilities? Perhaps they were just having a difficult time grasping the steps, or maybe they were distracted by something else entirely.\n\nPatient: I guess that's possible. I hadn't really considered that.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. This is where the Positive Data Log can be helpful. In this situation, you could write down something like, \"Even though some students seemed confused, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm a bad teacher. There could be other factors at play.\" Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see how that could be useful. It's just hard to remember to think that way in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's why practicing with the Positive Data Log is so important. The more you do it, the easier it will become to challenge those negative thoughts as they arise. Remember, we're not trying to dismiss your feelings or experiences, but rather to help you see them in a more balanced way.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll try to keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: Great. Now, let's talk about the argument you had with your mom. Can you tell me more about what happened and how it's been affecting you?\n\nPatient: Well, my mom called me to ask how I was doing, and I made the mistake of telling her about my struggles with finding evidence for the Positive Data Log. She got really frustrated and started lecturing me about how I need to be more positive and just \"snap out of it.\" It made me feel like she doesn't understand what I'm going through at all.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like that conversation was really difficult for you. It's not easy when we feel like our loved ones don't understand or validate our experiences. Let's explore this a bit further. What thoughts and emotions came up for you during and after the argument?\n\nPatient: I felt really frustrated and misunderstood. I kept thinking, \"She just doesn't get it. She thinks I can just choose to be happy, but it's not that simple.\" It made me feel even more alone in my struggles.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why you would feel that way. It's common for people who haven't experienced depression to have a hard time understanding what it's like. However, I wonder if there might be an opportunity here to communicate your needs and experiences to your mom in a different way. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I don't know. I feel like I've tried to explain it to her before, but she just doesn't seem to hear me.\n\nTherapist: I hear your hesitation, and I understand that it can be challenging to have these conversations. However, sometimes it can be helpful to approach them from a different angle. For example, you could try using \"I\" statements to express how her words make you feel, rather than focusing on what she's doing wrong. How do you think that might look?\n\nPatient: I guess I could say something like, \"I feel really hurt and misunderstood when you suggest that I can just snap out of my depression. It makes me feel like you don't take my struggles seriously.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of using an \"I\" statement. It expresses your feelings without placing blame or making accusations. How do you think your mom might respond to that?\n\nPatient: I don't know. I hope she would at least try to understand where I'm coming from.\n\nTherapist: It's possible that she might. And even if she doesn't respond perfectly, you'll have taken a step towards advocating for yourself and your needs. Remember, it's okay to set boundaries and communicate your expectations for support.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just hard when I feel like I'm always the one who has to compromise.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it can feel that way, Jamie. It's important to remember that relationships are a two-way street, and both parties need to be willing to listen and compromise. However, you can only control your own actions and responses. By communicating your needs clearly and calmly, you're taking a step towards building a healthier relationship with your mom.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just need to keep practicing.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, and that's what we're here to work on together. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Before we move on, let's take a moment to check in. How are you feeling after discussing the argument with your mom?\n\nPatient: I'm still feeling a bit frustrated, but I also feel a little more hopeful. I can see how using \"I\" statements might help me communicate better with her.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Jamie. It's okay to feel frustrated, and it's also okay to feel hopeful. Both of those emotions are valid. As we continue to work together, we'll keep exploring ways to manage difficult emotions and communicate effectively with the people in your life.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your support.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Now, let's take a look at the thought record you've been working on. Can you share an example of a thought you've challenged recently?",
