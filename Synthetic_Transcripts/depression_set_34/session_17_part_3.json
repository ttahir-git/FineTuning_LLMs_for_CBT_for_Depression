  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by exploring how your cultural background and family expectations might be influencing your core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" Can you tell me a bit about the messages you received growing up about success and worthiness?\n\nPatient: Well, my mom always emphasized the importance of education and achieving success through traditional means, like getting a stable job and making good money. She sacrificed a lot for me to have opportunities, so I feel like I need to live up to her expectations.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that you want to honor your mother's sacrifices and meet her expectations. However, it's also important to recognize that your worthiness isn't solely determined by external achievements. Let's explore this further. What does success mean to you personally, outside of your family's expectations?\n\nPatient: That's a good question. I guess, for me, success is about finding fulfillment in what I do and making a positive impact on others. But it's hard to separate that from the pressure to meet certain standards.\n\nTherapist: It's common to feel torn between personal values and external expectations. This is where the concept of \"shoulds\" comes in. \"Shoulds\" are rigid rules or expectations we hold for ourselves, often based on messages we've internalized from others. They can create a sense of pressure and lead to feelings of inadequacy when we don't meet them. Can you identify any \"shoulds\" that might be contributing to your core belief of \"I'm not good enough\"?\n\nPatient: I definitely have a lot of \"shoulds.\" I feel like I should be making more money, I should have a more prestigious career, I should be able to handle everything on my own without struggling.\n\nTherapist: These \"shoulds\" can be really powerful and pervasive. They often lead to a cycle of setting unrealistic standards, falling short, and then feeling like we're not good enough. The key is to start recognizing and challenging these \"shoulds.\" One way to do this is to reframe them as preferences rather than absolutes. For example, instead of saying \"I should be making more money,\" you could say \"I would prefer to be making more money, but my worth isn't defined by my income.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's just hard to break out of that mindset when it's been so ingrained.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it is hard. And it takes practice. Another helpful tool is to examine the evidence for and against these \"shoulds.\" For example, is it true that you should be able to handle everything on your own without struggling? What would you say to a friend who expressed this belief?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell a friend that it's okay to struggle and ask for help, and that nobody can handle everything on their own all the time.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And the same applies to you. Recognizing the double standard we often hold for ourselves versus others can help challenge these \"shoulds.\" It's about developing more self-compassion and realistic expectations.",
