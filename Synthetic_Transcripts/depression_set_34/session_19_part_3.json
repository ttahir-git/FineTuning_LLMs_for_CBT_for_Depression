  "transcript": "Patient: Some early warning signs I've identified are withdrawing from friends and activities, having trouble sleeping or sleeping too much, and getting stuck in negative thought patterns. I also tend to neglect my self-care routines when I'm starting to feel down.\n\nTherapist: Those are great insights. Recognizing your personal early warning signs is an important part of relapse prevention. Withdrawal, changes in sleep patterns, negative thought patterns, and neglecting self-care are all common signs that depression may be resurfacing. \n\nLet's discuss some strategies you can use when you notice these warning signs. What has helped you cope with these symptoms in the past?\n\nPatient: In the past, reaching out to friends or family members has been helpful, even if it's just to talk or spend time together. I also try to make sure I'm sticking to a regular sleep schedule and eating well, even if I don't feel motivated. Getting outside for a walk or doing some gentle yoga can help shift my mood too.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent strategies. Reaching out for social support, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, eating well, and engaging in gentle physical activity can all be powerful tools in managing depressive symptoms. It's great that you already have some go-to coping strategies.\n\nAnother helpful tool is creating a \"coping card\" with reminders of your new, adaptive thoughts and beliefs. This can be a physical card you keep with you or a note on your phone. The card might include statements like \"Thoughts are not facts\" or \"I am worthy of love and respect, even when I make mistakes.\" What adaptive thoughts or beliefs would you like to include on your coping card?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of a coping card. Some thoughts I might include are \"Progress over perfection,\" \"I am enough as I am,\" and \"Challenges are opportunities for growth.\" I find those reminders helpful when I'm feeling down on myself.\n\nTherapist: Those are wonderful, empowering statements. \"Progress over perfection\" is a great reminder to focus on growth rather than unrealistic standards. \"I am enough as I am\" affirms your inherent worth, and \"Challenges are opportunities for growth\" frames difficulties as chances to learn and develop. \n\nI encourage you to create a coping card with those statements and keep it somewhere easily accessible. You can pull it out whenever you need a boost or reminder of your new, adaptive beliefs.\n\nAnother strategy we can discuss is the idea of \"becoming your own therapist.\" This means applying the CBT principles and skills you've learned independently, without the guidance of a therapist. What do you think about this concept? How confident do you feel in your ability to be your own therapist?\n\nPatient: The idea of being my own therapist is both exciting and a little scary. I feel more confident in my ability to challenge negative thoughts and use the CBT skills we've practiced, but I worry about maintaining that progress without the structure and support of therapy.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel both excited and apprehensive about becoming your own therapist. It's a big step, and it's okay to feel uncertain. Remember, you've been building these skills throughout our work together, and you've already demonstrated your ability to apply them independently.\n\nOne way to ease the transition is to gradually taper the frequency of our sessions. We can move from weekly sessions to biweekly or monthly check-ins. This allows you to practice your skills while still having some support. We can also discuss options for ongoing support, such as joining a support group or scheduling periodic \"booster\" sessions as needed.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on gradually tapering our sessions and exploring other forms of support?\n\nPatient: Gradually tapering our sessions feels like a good middle ground. It will give me a chance to practice being my own therapist while still having some support. I'm also open to exploring other forms of support, like a support group or booster sessions. It's comforting to know I won't be completely on my own.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that option resonates with you. Tapering sessions and having a plan for ongoing support can make the transition feel more manageable. We can discuss the specifics of what that might look like for you in our remaining sessions.\n\nI also want to emphasize that becoming your own therapist doesn't mean you have to do everything perfectly or never struggle. It's about having the tools and the confidence to navigate challenges as they arise. You've already demonstrated your ability to do that, and I have full faith in your continued growth.\n\nWhat thoughts or questions do you have about the concept of being your own therapist?",
