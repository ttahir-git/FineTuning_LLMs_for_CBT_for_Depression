  "transcript": "Therapist: Great! Let's start with a recent situation where you noticed a strong negative emotion. Can you briefly describe the situation and the emotion you experienced?\n\nPatient: Sure. A few days ago, I was supposed to meet a friend for lunch, but they canceled at the last minute. I felt really disappointed and a bit angry.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so the situation was your friend canceling lunch plans, and the emotions you experienced were disappointment and anger. Now, let's identify the thoughts that went through your mind when you received the cancellation. What were you thinking in that moment?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"They don't really want to spend time with me\" and \"I'm not important to them.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are great examples of the types of negative thoughts we'll be working on in therapy. Now, let's consider the behaviors that resulted from those thoughts and emotions. What did you do after receiving the cancellation?\n\nPatient: I ended up staying home and moping around for the rest of the day. I didn't feel like doing anything else.\n\nTherapist: That's a common response to negative thoughts and emotions. We'll be working on developing alternative behaviors that can help break the cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. For now, let's practice completing a thought record based on the situation you just described. We'll write down the situation, your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, and then work on challenging those negative thoughts. Are you ready to give it a try?",
