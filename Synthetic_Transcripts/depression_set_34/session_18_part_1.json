  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 18. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate could be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand and appreciate you letting me know about your limitations. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to keep up with the thought records and positive data log, but it's been challenging at times. I did the cognitive experiment we planned, and it was interesting to see how my \"shoulds\" were affecting me. I'm still struggling with the idea of not being good enough, but I feel like I'm starting to make some progress.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on the homework exercises and that you're noticing some progress, even if it feels slow at times. I'm curious to hear more about your experience with the cognitive experiment. Before we dive into that, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to talk more about the cognitive experiment and how it's helping me challenge my \"shoulds.\" I also want to discuss how my cultural background and family expectations are still influencing my core belief of not being good enough. And maybe we could explore some strategies for maintaining my progress after our sessions end.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan for today's session. We can start by discussing your experience with the cognitive experiment and how it's helping you challenge your \"shoulds.\" Then, we can explore the impact of your cultural background and family expectations on your core belief. Finally, we'll discuss some strategies for maintaining your progress after our sessions end. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. Let's start with the cognitive experiment. Can you tell me more about how it went and what insights you gained from it?",
