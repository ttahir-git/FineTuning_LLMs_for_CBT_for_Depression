  "transcript": "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that summary, Jamie. It's great to hear that you feel it captures our discussion from the last session accurately. Before we dive into reviewing your homework and exploring your thought patterns further, I want to take a moment to set an agenda for our session today. This will help us stay on track and make the most of our time together. \n\nFirst, I'd like to review the thought record you kept over the past week and discuss any insights or challenges that came up for you while completing this exercise. Then, we'll start to identify specific negative thought patterns that may be contributing to your depression and explore how these thoughts might be connected to your feelings and behaviors. We'll also begin to discuss strategies for challenging and reframing these thoughts in a more balanced and helpful way.\n\nDoes this plan sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to make sure we cover today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm curious to see what patterns we might find in my thought record. One thing I wanted to mention is that I had a bit of a rough weekend. I ended up canceling my dance classes on Saturday because I just couldn't muster the energy to go. I felt really guilty about it afterwards. Maybe we could talk a bit about that too?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jamie. I'm glad you brought that up. We can definitely discuss what happened over the weekend and explore how your thoughts and feelings may have contributed to your decision to cancel your classes. It's important that we address the challenges you're facing in real-time, as they come up.\n\nBefore we do that, though, I want to acknowledge the effort it took for you to bring this up. It can be difficult to talk about moments when we feel we've fallen short of our own expectations. Recognizing and sharing these experiences is an important part of the therapeutic process.\n\nSo, let's start by taking a look at your thought record. Can you walk me through what you noticed as you were documenting your thoughts over the past week?",
