  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your experience with the behavioral activation activities we planned last session. How did the hike on Saturday go?\n\nPatient: The hike was good. I felt a bit better while I was out in nature, but the effect didn't last long. I struggled to motivate myself to go, but I pushed through and did it anyway.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you were able to push through the initial resistance and go for the hike. Even if the positive effects didn't last as long as you would have liked, it's a step in the right direction. What about the reading before bed on Tuesday and Thursday?\n\nPatient: I managed to read on Tuesday, but on Thursday, I got caught up in negative thoughts and ended up scrolling on my phone instead. I noticed that I felt more anxious and had a harder time falling asleep that night.\n\nTherapist: That's a valuable observation, Jamie. It shows the connection between your actions and your mood. Engaging in the planned activity of reading led to a better mood and easier time falling asleep, while scrolling on your phone had the opposite effect. This is something we can build on. Now, let's take a look at the thought records you've been keeping. Can you share an example of a thought you recorded and how you challenged it?\n\nPatient: Sure. I had a thought that said, \"I'm a failure because I couldn't keep my clients.\" I tried to challenge it by looking at the evidence for and against this thought. The evidence for was that I lost two clients recently. The evidence against was that I still have other clients who appreciate my work, and I've received positive feedback in the past.\n\nTherapist: Excellent work, Jamie! You've identified a common cognitive distortion called \"disqualifying the positive,\" where you focus only on the negative aspects of a situation and disregard the positive. By examining the evidence for and against the thought, you've taken an important step in challenging its validity. What was the outcome of this exercise? How did you feel after going through this process?\n\nPatient: After challenging the thought, I felt a bit better. I was able to see that losing two clients doesn't define my entire worth as a dance instructor. But the relief was temporary, and the negative thoughts crept back in later.\n\nTherapist: That's a normal experience, Jamie. Challenging negative thoughts is a skill that takes practice. The more you do it, the more automatic it will become, and the longer-lasting the effects will be. It's also important to remember that thoughts are not facts. Just because you think something doesn't make it true. Let's continue to work on building this skill. Now, let's move on to discussing strategies for managing financial stress. What are some of the thoughts and feelings that come up for you around this topic?\n\nPatient: I feel overwhelmed and anxious about my finances. I worry that I won't be able to make ends meet, and I'll have to give up my apartment and move back in with my mom. I feel guilty for not being more financially stable at this point in my life.\n\nTherapist: Financial stress can be a significant source of anxiety for many people. Let's break this down a bit. What specific aspects of your financial situation are causing you the most stress right now?\n\nPatient: The uncertainty of my income as a self-employed dance instructor is the biggest stressor. I never know when a client might decide to stop working with me, and that unpredictability makes it hard to plan for the future.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, Jamie. Uncertainty can be challenging to cope with, especially when it affects your livelihood. One strategy for managing this stress is to focus on the things you can control. For example, you can create a budget to better understand your income and expenses, and you can explore ways to diversify your income streams, such as offering online classes or workshops. Another strategy is to practice mindfulness and grounding techniques when you notice yourself getting caught up in anxious thoughts about the future. Can you think of a time recently when you could have used these strategies to manage your financial stress?\n\nPatient: Last week, when I found out that potential new client decided to go with another instructor, I started spiraling into worst-case scenarios about my financial future. I could have used mindfulness to ground myself in the present moment and remind myself that I can't control everything, but I can control my response to the situation.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Practicing mindfulness in those moments can help you maintain perspective and avoid getting overwhelmed by anxious thoughts. It's also important to challenge the thoughts that contribute to your financial stress, just as you did with the thoughts about losing clients. Let's explore this further. What are some of the thoughts you have about your financial situation that might not be entirely accurate or helpful?\n\nPatient: I often think that I should be making more money at this point in my life, and that there must be something wrong with me because I'm not more financially successful.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts contain elements of \"should\" statements and personalization, which are common cognitive distortions. \"Should\" statements involve holding yourself to rigid, unrealistic standards, while personalization involves taking excessive responsibility for things that are not entirely within your control. Let's challenge these thoughts. What's the evidence for and against the idea that you should be making more money at this point in your life?",
