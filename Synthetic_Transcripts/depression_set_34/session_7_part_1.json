  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's good to see you again. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like mindfulness and thought records. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I had that conversation with my friend about feeling guilty for relying on them, and it went better than I expected. They were really understanding and supportive.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and that your conversation with your friend went well. It takes courage to open up like that. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling emotionally and what challenges you've faced since our last session?\n\nPatient: Emotionally, I've had some ups and downs. I had a few good days where I felt more motivated and hopeful, but then I lost another client, and it sent me into a bit of a downward spiral. I started having those negative thoughts again, like \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'll never be successful.\" It's been hard to shake off those feelings of worthlessness.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to have those negative thoughts and feelings, especially after losing another client. I'm here to support you through this. Based on what you've shared, it seems like it would be helpful for us to focus on managing these negative thoughts and emotions today. What do you think about setting an agenda that includes reviewing your thought records, discussing the loss of your client and its impact on your mood, and exploring additional coping strategies for managing distressing emotions?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I definitely need some help with managing these negative thoughts and feelings. I'm also wondering if we could talk about how to handle the financial stress that comes with losing clients. It's been weighing on me heavily.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can certainly include discussing strategies for managing financial stress in our agenda. Here's what I propose for today's session:\n\n1. Review your thought records and discuss any challenges or insights you've had while using this technique.\n2. Explore the emotional impact of losing another client and identify coping strategies for managing the distressing thoughts and feelings that have arisen.\n3. Discuss strategies for managing financial stress and developing a plan to address your financial concerns.\n4. Introduce additional distress tolerance techniques to help you manage overwhelming emotions in the moment.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or focus on today?",
