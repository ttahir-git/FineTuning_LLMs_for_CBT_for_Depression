  "transcript": "Patient: A crisis plan sounds like a really good idea. I think having a clear plan in place could help me feel more in control when my emotions start to feel overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find the idea of a crisis plan helpful. Having a clear plan in place can definitely help you feel more in control and prepared when your emotions start to feel overwhelming.\n\nTo create your crisis plan, start by identifying your warning signs. These are the thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that indicate you're starting to feel overwhelmed or in crisis. Some common warning signs include feeling hopeless, having thoughts of self-harm, isolating yourself from others, or experiencing changes in your sleep or appetite.\n\nOnce you've identified your warning signs, make a list of coping strategies you can use to manage your emotions when you notice these signs. These might include the techniques we've discussed today, such as mindfulness, grounding exercises, radical acceptance, opposite action, and self-soothing.\n\nNext, make a list of people you can reach out to for support when you're feeling overwhelmed. This might include friends, family members, or a therapist. Write down their names and contact information, so you have it easily accessible when you need it.\n\nFinally, make a list of emergency resources you can contact if you need immediate help. This might include a crisis hotline, emergency services, or a local mental health clinic. Write down their names and contact information, so you have it easily accessible when you need it.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can see how having all of that information written down in one place could be really helpful in a crisis.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Having all of that information written down in one place can make it easier to access the support you need when you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nIn addition to creating a crisis plan, it can also be helpful to practice your coping strategies regularly, even when you're not in crisis. By practicing your coping strategies regularly, you can build up your emotional resilience and make it easier to manage overwhelming emotions when they do arise.\n\nFor example, you might set aside a few minutes each day to practice mindfulness or grounding exercises. Or you might schedule regular self-soothing activities, such as taking a warm bath or listening to soothing music.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I can see how practicing my coping strategies regularly could help me build up my emotional resilience over time.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right. Practicing your coping strategies regularly can help you build up your emotional resilience and make it easier to manage overwhelming emotions when they do arise.\n\nAnother helpful strategy for managing overwhelming emotions is to engage in regular self-care activities. Self-care activities are activities that promote physical, emotional, and mental well-being, such as getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and engaging in hobbies or activities you enjoy.\n\nBy engaging in regular self-care activities, you can improve your overall well-being and reduce your vulnerability to overwhelming emotions. Self-care activities can also help you build up your emotional resilience and make it easier to manage overwhelming emotions when they do arise.\n\nPatient: I can see how engaging in regular self-care activities could help me feel better overall and make me less vulnerable to overwhelming emotions.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Engaging in regular self-care activities can help you feel better overall and make you less vulnerable to overwhelming emotions.\n\nIt's important to remember that self-care looks different for everyone, and what works for one person might not work for another. It's important to experiment with different self-care activities and find what works best for you.\n\nSome common self-care activities include:\n\n1. Getting enough sleep (7-9 hours per night for most adults)\n2. Eating a healthy diet (plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein)\n3. Exercising regularly (at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week)\n4. Engaging in hobbies or activities you enjoy (such as reading, painting, or playing music)\n5. Spending time with friends and family\n6. Practicing relaxation techniques (such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery)\n7. Seeking professional help when needed (such as therapy or counseling)\n\nPatient: That's a great list. I can see how incorporating some of those activities into my regular routine could help me feel better overall and make me less vulnerable to overwhelming emotions.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find the list helpful. Incorporating some of those activities into your regular routine can definitely help you feel better overall and make you less vulnerable to overwhelming emotions.\n\nRemember, self-care is an ongoing process, and it's important to be patient and compassionate with yourself as you work on incorporating self-care activities into your routine. It's also important to recognize that there will be times when you're not able to engage in self-care as much as you'd like, and that's okay. The important thing is to do your best and keep trying.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I can see how being patient and compassionate with myself could help me stick with my self-care routine, even when it's challenging.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Being patient and compassionate with yourself can definitely help you stick with your self-care routine, even when it's challenging.\n\nAnother helpful strategy for managing overwhelming emotions is to challenge negative thoughts. Negative thoughts can contribute to overwhelming emotions by distorting your perception of reality and making situations seem worse than they actually are.\n\nTo challenge negative thoughts, start by identifying the thought and the emotion it's associated with. Then, look for evidence that supports or refutes the thought. Finally, come up with a more balanced and realistic thought based on the evidence.\n\nFor example, if you have the thought \"I'm a failure\" and the associated emotion is sadness, you might look for evidence that supports or refutes the thought. Evidence that supports the thought might include times when you've made mistakes or experienced setbacks. Evidence that refutes the thought might include times when you've succeeded or accomplished something you're proud of.\n\nBased on the evidence, you might come up with a more balanced and realistic thought, such as \"I've made mistakes and experienced setbacks, but I've also had successes and accomplished things I'm proud of. I'm not a failure, even though I sometimes feel like one.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can see how challenging negative thoughts could help me feel less overwhelmed by my emotions.",
