  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about that. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the skills we've been working on, like challenging my negative thoughts and focusing on self-care. It's been challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making progress.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've discussed and that you're noticing progress, even if it's challenging at times. Can you share a bit more about how your mood has been and if there have been any significant changes or experiences since our last session?\n\nPatient: My mood has been relatively stable, with some ups and downs. I had a bit of a rough patch earlier this week when I received some critical feedback from a client, but I tried to use the thought records to work through it. It helped me recognize that the feedback was specific to one situation and not a reflection of my overall worth or abilities.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you were able to apply the thought records in a challenging situation. Recognizing that specific feedback doesn't define your overall worth is a significant insight. I'm curious, how did you feel after working through the thought record?\n\nPatient: After completing the thought record, I felt a bit lighter and more balanced. It helped me put the feedback into perspective and not get stuck in a negative spiral. I still felt a bit down, but it was more manageable.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example of how using the skills we've practiced can help manage difficult emotions and maintain a more balanced perspective. I'm proud of you for applying the thought record in a real-life situation.\n\nGiven what you've shared, I'd like to propose the following agenda for today's session:\n\n1. Review your homework from last week, including the thought records, positive data log, and draft of your relapse prevention plan.\n2. Discuss any challenges or insights that came up while working on your homework.\n3. Introduce the concept of meta-thought records and practice applying them to your experience of CBT.\n4. Continue refining your relapse prevention plan, focusing on identifying early warning signs and coping strategies.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
