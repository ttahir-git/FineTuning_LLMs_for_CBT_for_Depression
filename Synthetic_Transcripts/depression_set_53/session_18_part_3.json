  "transcript": "Patient: I feel a bit lighter after going through that process. It helps to break down my thoughts and look at the evidence more objectively. I can see how generating more balanced thoughts can help me challenge my negative core beliefs.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. You're doing a great job of applying the cognitive restructuring process to your own experiences. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become more natural and automatic over time.\n\nNow, let's take a moment to review your Positive Data Log. Can you share some of the evidence you've gathered that supports your new core belief, \"I am talented and worthy of praise and recognition\"?\n\nPatient: Sure. One piece of evidence is the positive feedback I received from my veterans support group member about my photography. Another is the sense of accomplishment and pride I felt when I completed a challenging photo project I had been working on.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of evidence that support your new core belief. It's important to continue gathering this evidence and referring back to it when you're struggling with self-doubt or negative thoughts.\n\nAnother helpful tool we can use to reinforce your new core belief is coping cards. Coping cards are small, portable reminders of your adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs. They can be especially useful in moments when you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling with negative thoughts.\n\nLet's create a coping card together based on the evidence you've gathered in your Positive Data Log. What would you like to include on your card?\n\nPatient: I could write down the positive feedback I received from my support group member, like \"You have a great eye for composition.\" I could also include a reminder of my new core belief, \"I am talented and worthy of praise and recognition.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great start! You can also include any other adaptive thoughts or personal affirmations that resonate with you. The goal is to create a personalized card that you can refer to in challenging moments to help you stay grounded in your new, more balanced beliefs.\n\nAs we continue to work on reinforcing your new core belief, it's also important to plan for potential challenges and setbacks. One strategy we can use is relapse prevention planning. This involves identifying early warning signs of depression and developing a plan for how to cope with them.\n\nWhat do you think might be some early warning signs that your depression symptoms are starting to worsen?\n\nPatient: I think one early warning sign might be if I start to lose interest in photography again, or if I find myself avoiding social interactions more than usual. Another sign might be if I start to have more frequent negative thoughts about myself and my abilities.\n\nTherapist: Those are great insights. Being aware of these early warning signs can help you take action sooner and prevent a more significant setback. What are some strategies you can use to cope if you notice these signs?\n\nPatient: I could reach out to my support system, like my wife or my veterans support group. I could also review my coping cards and Positive Data Log to remind myself of my new core beliefs and the progress I've made.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent strategies. It's also important to remember that setbacks are a normal part of the recovery process. They don't mean that you've failed or that your progress isn't real. What matters is how you respond to those setbacks and how you use your CBT skills to get back on track.\n\nAs we near the end of our session today, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made and the hard work you've put into challenging your negative thoughts and core beliefs. You've been consistently practicing your CBT skills, and I can see the positive impact it's having on your mood and overall well-being.\n\nWhat are some key takeaways or insights from our session today that you'd like to carry with you moving forward?\n\nPatient: I think the biggest takeaway for me is the importance of gathering evidence to support my new core belief and using tools like coping cards to reinforce it. I also appreciate the reminder that setbacks are normal and that I have the skills to cope with them.\n\nTherapist: Those are great takeaways. Remember, you have the power to change your thoughts and beliefs, and you've already made significant progress in doing so. As we continue our work together, we'll keep building on these skills and reinforcing your new, more adaptive beliefs.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue adding to your Positive Data Log and create a few more coping cards based on the evidence you gather. We'll review your progress and discuss any challenges or successes in our next session.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I appreciate your support and guidance throughout this process. It's not always easy, but I feel like I'm making real progress.",
