  "transcript": "Patient: During the call, I felt sad and rejected. I also felt frustrated with myself for not being able to connect with her better.\n\nTherapist: Those emotions are understandable given the situation and your interpretation of it. Let's look at the thoughts that led to those feelings. What was going through your mind during and after the call?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"She doesn't want to talk to me,\" \"I'm a burden to her,\" and \"I've failed as a mother because our relationship isn't closer.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing those thoughts. I can see how they would lead to feelings of sadness, rejection, and frustration. Now, let's examine the evidence for and against these thoughts, starting with \"She doesn't want to talk to me.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, she seemed distracted and rushed to get off the phone. That makes me think she didn't really want to talk to me.\n\nTherapist: Okay, that's one piece of evidence. Now, let's consider evidence against this thought. Have there been times when your daughter has initiated contact or expressed interest in talking to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, she calls me every few weeks to check in, and she often sends me pictures of my grandchildren.\n\nTherapist: So, while she may have seemed distracted during this particular call, there is evidence that she does value your relationship and enjoys talking to you at other times. Let's move on to the thought \"I'm a burden to her.\" What evidence do you have for this thought?\n\nPatient: I sometimes feel like I'm intruding on her busy life when I call her. She has so much going on with work and her family.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to have those concerns, but let's look at the evidence against this thought. Has your daughter ever expressed that she feels burdened by your calls or relationship?\n\nPatient: No, she's never said anything like that. In fact, she often thanks me for calling and checking in on her.\n\nTherapist: That's important to consider. It seems that while you may worry about being a burden, your daughter has not given any indication that she feels this way. Instead, she expresses gratitude for your efforts to stay connected. Now, let's examine the thought \"I've failed as a mother because our relationship isn't closer.\" What evidence do you have for this thought?\n\nPatient: I sometimes feel like I didn't do enough to foster a close relationship with her when she was growing up, especially during my busy times at work.\n\nTherapist: It's common for parents to have regrets or doubts about their parenting. However, let's consider evidence against this thought. Can you think of ways in which you have been a supportive and loving mother, even if your relationship isn't as close as you'd like it to be now?\n\nPatient: Well, I always made sure my children had what they needed, and I tried to be there for them when they needed me. I attended their school events and helped them with their problems.\n\nTherapist: Those are important examples of how you have been a supportive mother. It's also important to remember that relationships are complex, and the closeness of your relationship with your daughter is not solely determined by your actions as a mother. Your daughter's choices and life circumstances also play a role. With this evidence in mind, how might you reframe the thought \"I've failed as a mother because our relationship isn't closer\"?\n\nPatient: I guess I could say, \"Even though our relationship isn't as close as I'd like it to be, I have been a supportive and loving mother in many ways throughout her life.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges your desire for a closer relationship while also recognizing the ways in which you have been a good mother. How do you feel when you consider this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit lighter and less critical of myself. It reminds me that I've done my best, even if our relationship isn't perfect.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful. Challenging negative thoughts and considering alternative perspectives can help alleviate some of the distress associated with those thoughts. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to catch and reframe negative thoughts in the moment.",
