  "transcript": "Therapist: Can you walk me through what happened in that situation, and what thoughts and emotions you experienced?\n\nPatient: Sure. A few days ago, I was looking through some old photographs from my travels, and I started feeling really nostalgic. I thought about how much I used to enjoy photography and how I don't do it as much anymore. Then, I started thinking that I've lost my passion and that I'll never be able to find that same joy again.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mei. I can understand how looking at old photographs could bring up feelings of nostalgia and even a sense of loss. Let's try to break down the thoughts you had in that moment. When you thought, \"I've lost my passion,\" what emotions did you feel?\n\nPatient: I felt sad and hopeless, like a part of me was missing.\n\nTherapist: That's a powerful emotional response. Now, let's examine the evidence for and against the thought, \"I've lost my passion.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I haven't been doing photography as much as I used to, and I don't feel the same excitement about it that I once did.\n\nTherapist: Okay, that's valid evidence. Now, let's consider the evidence against this thought. Have there been any moments recently where you've felt even a glimmer of interest or enjoyment in photography?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. Last week, I took a walk in the park and saw a beautiful sunset. I wished I had brought my camera with me to capture it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of evidence against the thought that you've lost your passion. Even though you haven't been actively pursuing photography, that moment shows that you still have an appreciation for it. Let's try to reframe the original thought in a more balanced way. What might be an alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I guess an alternative thought could be, \"Even though I haven't been as active in photography lately, I still have moments where I appreciate beauty and feel a desire to capture it.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful alternative thought, Mei. It acknowledges your current situation while also recognizing that your passion for photography hasn't disappeared entirely. How do you feel when you consider this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit more hopeful, like maybe I haven't lost my passion after all.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. This is a perfect example of how challenging our negative thoughts can help shift our emotions. As we continue practicing this skill, it will become easier to catch those thoughts in the moment and reframe them.",
