  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the communication strategies with Lisa, and I've been setting aside time for photography. However, I still find it challenging to accept positive feedback about my work.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the communication strategies and making time for photography. It's understandable that accepting positive feedback can be challenging. We can definitely explore that further today. How has your mood been overall?\n\nPatient: My mood has been relatively stable, but I still have moments where I feel down or frustrated with myself. I've been trying to use the thought records to challenge those negative thoughts, but it's not always easy.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been using the thought records, even if it's not always easy. Challenging negative thoughts takes practice, and it's normal to have ups and downs in the process. I'm here to support you through it. Based on what you've shared, it seems like we could focus on a few things today:\n1. Reviewing your progress with the homework and discussing any challenges or successes\n2. Exploring the difficulty in accepting positive feedback about your photography\n3. Continuing to work on cognitive restructuring and challenging negative thoughts\n4. Discussing any new concerns or topics that may have come up since our last session\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
