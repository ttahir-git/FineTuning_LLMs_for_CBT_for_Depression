  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the skills we discussed, like thought records and mindfulness. I had a conversation with Lisa using \"I\" statements, and it went better than I expected. However, I'm still struggling with catching my negative thoughts in the moment and finding the motivation to exercise regularly.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've discussed and that your conversation with Lisa went well. It's understandable that catching negative thoughts and finding motivation for exercise can be challenging. We can definitely explore these areas further today. Before we set our agenda, can you tell me a bit more about how you've been feeling emotionally since our last session?\n\nPatient: Emotionally, I've had some ups and downs. I felt hopeful after our last session and the conversation with Lisa, but there are still moments when I feel overwhelmed and sad. I'm trying to be patient with myself and remember that change takes time.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're able to recognize and acknowledge both the positive and challenging emotions you've experienced. Remembering that change is a process and being patient with yourself is crucial. Today, I'd like to suggest that we focus on exploring your struggles with catching negative thoughts and finding motivation for exercise. We can also discuss any other concerns or topics that are on your mind. What do you think about this plan for our session?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'd like to work on those areas, and I don't have any other pressing concerns at the moment.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's start with discussing your experience with catching negative thoughts. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you found it challenging to identify and challenge your negative thoughts in the moment?",
