  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your experiences with practicing communication skills with Lisa and reaching out to a friend since our last session. How did it go?\n\nPatient: Practicing the communication skills with Lisa was challenging at first. I found myself falling into old patterns of communication, but I tried to catch myself and use \"I\" statements and reflective listening. It felt a bit awkward initially, but I noticed that our conversations were more productive, and we both seemed to feel more heard and understood. As for reaching out to a friend, I did reach out to my friend Sarah, whom I've known for years. We met for coffee, and I opened up a bit about my struggles with depression. She was very supportive and shared some of her own experiences as well. It felt good to connect with someone outside of my family.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been making progress with the communication skills, even though it felt challenging and awkward at times. It's normal for new skills to feel uncomfortable initially, but with practice, they become more natural. I'm also glad to hear that you reached out to Sarah and had a positive experience sharing your struggles with her. Connecting with others who can relate to our experiences can be incredibly validating and helpful. Did you notice any changes in your mood or thoughts after these interactions?\n\nPatient: After the conversations with Lisa and Sarah, I did notice that I felt a bit lighter and more connected. It reminded me of the importance of having supportive relationships and being open about my struggles. However, I also noticed that I had some negative thoughts creeping in afterward, like \"I should have been able to figure this out on my own\" or \"I'm burdening others with my problems.\"\n\nTherapist: It's common to have mixed feelings and thoughts after trying new things, especially when it comes to vulnerability and reaching out for support. The negative thoughts you mentioned are examples of cognitive distortions, specifically \"should\" statements and mind reading. Let's explore these thoughts further using a thought record. Can you walk me through the situation, your emotions, and the thoughts that came up?\n\nPatient: Sure. The situation was after my coffee meeting with Sarah. I felt a mix of relief and connection, but also guilt and shame. The prominent automatic thought was \"I'm burdening others with my problems.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's look at the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're burdening others?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I assume that others don't want to hear about my problems or that I'm taking up too much of their time and energy.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against this thought?\n\nPatient: Sarah seemed genuinely interested and supportive during our conversation. She even shared her own struggles, which made me feel like she could relate. And I know that when my friends come to me with their problems, I don't feel burdened but rather happy to support them.\n\nTherapist: Based on the evidence, it seems that the thought \"I'm burdening others with my problems\" may not be entirely accurate. Can we come up with an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence against the original thought?\n\nPatient: I suppose an alternative thought could be \"Sharing my struggles with trusted friends can lead to mutual support and connection, and it doesn't necessarily burden them.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought! How does this new perspective feel compared to the original thought?\n\nPatient: It feels more balanced and less judgmental. It reminds me that reaching out for support is okay and can be beneficial for both parties.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Challenging negative thoughts and finding more balanced alternatives can help shift our perspective and improve our mood. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the easier it becomes. Let's continue to work on identifying and challenging cognitive distortions as they come up.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm starting to see how my thoughts can influence my emotions and behaviors.\n\nTherapist: You're making great insights, Mei. As we continue to work on these skills, you'll likely notice even more connections between your thoughts, feelings, and actions. Speaking of behaviors, how has it been going with engaging in activities that align with your values, like photography?",
