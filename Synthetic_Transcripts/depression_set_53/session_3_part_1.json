  "transcript": "Here is part 1 of the CBT assessment session 3 of 3 for Mei Xiang:\n\nTherapist: Hello Mei, it's good to see you again for our third session. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to any information about you beyond what you share with me in our sessions. I'm also not able to interpret non-verbal cues or provide crisis intervention if needed. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova. I've been doing alright, about the same as before. I've been trying to work on the homework you gave me, identifying those cognitive distortions in my thoughts. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see how often I fall into those negative thinking patterns.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you've been practicing the skills we discussed. Identifying cognitive distortions is an important first step in changing those negative thought patterns that contribute to depression. Before we dive into reviewing your homework, let's set an agenda for our session today. I'd like to:\n\n1. Review your thought records and the cognitive distortions you identified \n2. Finalize our conceptualization of how your thoughts, feelings and behaviors are interacting to maintain your depression\n3. Start setting some specific, measurable goals for your therapy\n4. Introduce a new skill to help you start shifting those negative thought patterns\n\nDoes this sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to make sure we cover today?",
