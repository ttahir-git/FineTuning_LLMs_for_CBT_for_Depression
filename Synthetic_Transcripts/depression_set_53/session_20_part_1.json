  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in any way I can within these limitations. Now, let's start by checking in on how you've been doing since our last session. How have you been feeling, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing relatively well. I've been practicing the stress management techniques we discussed, particularly progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness. I find that they help me feel more grounded and less overwhelmed by my thoughts and emotions. I've also been working on my wellness action plan, trying to incorporate more self-care activities into my routine, like going for nature walks and dedicating time to photography. However, I've still been struggling with emotional eating and managing stress related to family issues.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the stress management techniques and working on your wellness action plan, Mei. Incorporating self-care activities like nature walks and photography is a wonderful way to prioritize your well-being. Regarding emotional eating and family-related stress, let's explore those challenges further today. Before we dive in, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize today, and are there any specific topics or goals you'd like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on strategies for managing emotional eating and discussing some of the family issues that have been causing me stress. I'm also interested in reviewing my thought records and discussing how I can continue to challenge negative thoughts. Additionally, I'd like to explore how I can maintain my progress after our sessions come to an end.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a productive agenda, Mei. We'll start by discussing strategies for managing emotional eating and exploring the family issues that have been causing you stress. Then, we'll review your thought records and discuss ways to continue challenging negative thoughts. Finally, we'll focus on relapse prevention planning and how you can maintain your progress after our sessions conclude. Let's begin with emotional eating. Can you tell me more about the situations or emotions that tend to trigger this behavior for you?",
