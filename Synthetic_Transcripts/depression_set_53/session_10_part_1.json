  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for our 10th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your support nonetheless. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the grounding techniques and mindfulness meditation you taught me. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I shared my progress with my friend from the veterans support group, and she was really encouraging. However, I still haven't heard back from the photography club, and it's been bothering me more than I thought it would.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we discussed and that you reached out to your friend for support. It's great that she was encouraging, and it's understandable that not hearing back from the photography club has been bothering you. Let's explore that further today. How about we start by setting an agenda for our session? What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to talk more about the photography club situation and how it's affecting me. I also want to discuss how I can improve my consistency with the grounding techniques and mindfulness meditation. And maybe we could explore some ways to help me feel more connected with others, as I've been feeling quite lonely lately.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan, Mei. So, our agenda for today will include:\n1. Discussing the photography club situation and its impact on you\n2. Exploring ways to improve consistency with grounding techniques and mindfulness meditation\n3. Identifying strategies to help you feel more connected with others and alleviate loneliness\n\nWe can start with the photography club situation and then move on to the other topics. How does that sound?",
