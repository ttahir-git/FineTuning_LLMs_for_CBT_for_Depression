  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job today, Mei, in exploring the core belief that's been contributing to your difficulty in accepting positive feedback. As we wrap up our session, I'd like to assign some homework to help you continue working on reframing this belief.\n\nPatient: Okay, what would you like me to do?\n\nTherapist: First, I'd like you to continue using the Positive Data Log we discussed earlier. Whenever you receive positive feedback or have an experience that supports the new core belief, \"I am talented and worthy of praise and recognition,\" write it down in your log. Try to do this at least once a day.\n\nPatient: I can do that.\n\nTherapist: Great! Second, I'd like you to practice using the thought record to challenge negative thoughts related to your photography and self-worth. When you notice yourself having a negative thought, write it down and look for evidence that supports or refutes it. Then, try to come up with a more balanced and adaptive thought.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful! Remember, the more you practice these skills, the easier they'll become. Before we end our session, I'd like to check in with you about your current mood and any final thoughts you have.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also hopeful. It's been helpful to understand why I struggle with accepting positive feedback, and I'm looking forward to working on reframing that core belief.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Mei. Remember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. We'll continue working on this together in our next session. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Difficulty in accepting positive feedback about photography\n  - Identifying and challenging the core belief \"I'm not good enough or worthy of praise and recognition\"\n  - Introducing the Positive Data Log to gather evidence for a new, more adaptive core belief\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (ongoing)\n  - Cognitive restructuring and challenging cognitive distortions (reviewed and practiced)\n  - Downward Arrow Technique (used to identify core belief)\n  - Positive Data Log (introduced and assigned as homework)\n  - Communication strategies, including \"I\" statements, active listening, and soft start-up (reviewed)\n  - Goal-setting related to photography (reviewed)\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue using the Positive Data Log to gather evidence for the new core belief \"I am talented and worthy of praise and recognition.\" Write down at least one piece of evidence per day.\n  - Practice using thought records to challenge negative thoughts related to photography and self-worth.
