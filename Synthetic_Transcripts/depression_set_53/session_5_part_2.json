  "transcript": "Patient: The overwhelming emotions usually come up when I'm alone at home, and my mind starts wandering to thoughts about my relationships and my current situation. I feel a sense of loneliness and disconnection from my wife and children, and I start to believe that I'm not doing enough to maintain those relationships. I also feel stuck in my life, like I'm not making progress or finding purpose in my daily activities.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mei. It's common for overwhelming emotions to arise when we're alone and have time to ruminate on negative thoughts. The thoughts you mentioned about your relationships and feeling stuck are closely tied to the emotions you're experiencing. In CBT, we often talk about the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. When we have negative thoughts, they can lead to distressing emotions, which in turn can influence our behaviors, such as withdrawing or avoiding certain situations.\n\nTo help manage these overwhelming emotions, we can use distress tolerance techniques. These are skills that can help you cope with intense emotions in the moment, without making the situation worse. One effective technique is deep breathing. When you notice yourself feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to focus on your breath. Breathe in slowly through your nose for a count of four, hold the breath for a count of four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Repeat this process several times, focusing your attention on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.\n\nAnother helpful technique is grounding. This involves using your senses to connect with the present moment. You can do this by noticing five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can help bring your focus back to the present moment and away from distressing thoughts.\n\nHow do you feel about trying these techniques the next time you notice overwhelming emotions arising?\n\nPatient: I'm willing to give them a try. The deep breathing and grounding techniques seem like they could be helpful in those moments when I feel like my emotions are taking over. I appreciate you explaining the connection between my thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It makes sense that my negative thoughts about my relationships and feeling stuck are contributing to these overwhelming emotions.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find the explanation helpful, Mei. Understanding the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors is a crucial part of CBT. By recognizing how negative thoughts can lead to distressing emotions and unhelpful behaviors, we can start to break the cycle and make changes.\n\nAnother technique we can use to manage overwhelming emotions is called \"self-soothing.\" This involves engaging in activities that are comforting and soothing to your senses. For example, you might take a warm bath, listen to calming music, or engage in a creative activity like drawing or painting. The goal is to provide yourself with a sense of comfort and nurturance during difficult moments.\n\nI'd like to encourage you to practice these distress tolerance techniques over the next week, in addition to continuing with the behavioral activation and mood monitoring we discussed earlier. Remember, it's okay if these techniques feel challenging at first. Like any new skill, it takes practice to become more comfortable with them.\n\nPatient: I appreciate you providing me with these tools to manage my emotions. I can see how engaging in soothing activities could be helpful when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I'll make a plan to practice these techniques, along with continuing the behavioral activation and mood monitoring.\n\nTherapist: That sounds great, Mei. I'm confident that with practice, you'll start to notice a difference in your ability to manage overwhelming emotions. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate these emotions entirely, but rather to develop skills to cope with them in a healthier way.\n\nAs we continue our work together, we'll explore more strategies for managing negative thoughts and building more fulfilling relationships. For now, let's focus on practicing these distress tolerance techniques and continuing with the behavioral activation and mood monitoring.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed so far?",
