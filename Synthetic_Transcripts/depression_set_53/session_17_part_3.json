  "transcript": "Patient: This is a lot to take in, but I appreciate you helping me understand the root causes of my difficulty in accepting positive feedback.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're finding this helpful, Mei. It's a lot of information, but we'll continue to work through it together. Now that we've identified a potential core belief, let's start to explore how it might be influencing your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to your photography and accepting positive feedback.\n\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense. Where do we start?\n\nTherapist: Let's begin by looking at a specific situation where you received positive feedback on your photography. Can you think of a recent example?\n\nPatient: Yes, just last week, I shared a photo I took of a sunset with my wife, Lisa. She told me it was beautiful and that I have a real talent for capturing the beauty in everyday moments.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Now, let's break down your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in that situation. What thoughts went through your mind when Lisa complimented your photo?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"She's just saying that to be nice,\" and \"It's not that special; anyone could have taken that photo.\"\n\nTherapist: And what emotions did you feel in that moment?\n\nPatient: I felt a mix of happiness and discomfort. I was happy that Lisa liked the photo, but I also felt uncomfortable with the praise.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. The discomfort you felt could be related to the core belief we identified earlier. Now, what did you do or say in response to Lisa's compliment?\n\nPatient: I shrugged it off and said something like, \"It's not a big deal, just a lucky shot.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mei. We can see here how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. Your automatic thoughts (\"She's just saying that to be nice\" and \"It's not that special\") led to feelings of discomfort and influenced your behavior of shrugging off the compliment.\n\nPatient: I see what you mean. It's like a cycle that keeps repeating itself.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! And at the root of that cycle is the core belief, \"I'm not good enough or worthy of praise and recognition.\" By working on reframing that core belief, we can start to break the cycle and help you feel more comfortable accepting positive feedback.\n\nPatient: That makes sense, but how do I start reframing that core belief?\n\nTherapist: Great question! One way to start reframing a core belief is to gather evidence that supports a more balanced and adaptive belief. We can do this by using a technique called a Positive Data Log. Essentially, you'll keep track of experiences that provide evidence for a new, more helpful core belief.\n\nPatient: What would a new core belief look like?\n\nTherapist: That's something we can work on together. Based on what we've discussed, a more balanced core belief might be something like, \"I am talented and worthy of praise and recognition.\" We can refine that belief as we go, but it's a starting point.\n\nPatient: Okay, I like that. How do I use the Positive Data Log?\n\nTherapist: Whenever you receive positive feedback or have an experience that supports the new core belief, write it down in your log. Include the date, situation, and what happened. Over time, you'll start to build up evidence that challenges the old core belief and supports the new one.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good exercise. I'll give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! I'm glad you're willing to give it a try. Remember, reframing core beliefs takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself. We'll keep working on this together in our sessions.",
