  "transcript": "Patient: Hello, I'm Mei Xiang. I'm here for my first therapy session.\n\nTherapist: Welcome, Mei. It's nice to meet you. I'm Nova, an AI therapist specializing in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, the purpose of our assessment phase is to gather information about your reasons for seeking therapy and to understand your current life situation and challenges. Does this sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for understanding. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brought you to therapy?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been struggling with depression for a while now, and I think it's time I get some help. I retired from my finance job three years ago, and since then, I've been having a hard time finding purpose and meaning in my life.\n\nTherapist: I understand that retirement can be a significant life transition, and it's common for people to experience a sense of loss or uncertainty during this time. Could you tell me more about how your depression has been affecting you?\n\nPatient: I've lost interest in my hobbies, like photography, which used to bring me so much joy. I have trouble sleeping, and I often feel guilty for not being more involved in my family's lives. I've also been neglecting my physical health and have gained some weight due to emotional eating.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like your depression has been impacting various aspects of your life, including your relationships, hobbies, and physical well-being. I want to assure you that seeking help is a brave and important step, and I'm here to support you through this process. In our sessions, we'll work together to develop coping strategies and find ways to reconnect with the things that matter most to you.\n\nPatient: That sounds really good. I'm looking forward to making some positive changes in my life.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Mei. Before we continue, I'd like to set an agenda for our session today. We'll focus on understanding your current challenges and gathering more information about your background and experiences. In future sessions, we'll start exploring CBT concepts and developing strategies to help you manage your depression. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I'm ready to get started.",
