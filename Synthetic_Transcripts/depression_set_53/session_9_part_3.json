  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great points about being patient and persistent, Mei. These qualities will serve you well as you continue to pursue your interests and connect with others. I'd like to explore a little more about your feelings of rejection when you didn't hear back from the photography club. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that went through your mind when you realized you hadn't received a response?\n\nPatient: Well, my first thought was that they probably didn't like my work or didn't think I was good enough to join their club. I started to feel like maybe I'm not as talented as I thought I was, and that made me question whether I should even keep trying to pursue photography.\n\nTherapist: It's interesting how quickly our minds can jump to negative conclusions, isn't it? This is a great opportunity to practice challenging some of those negative thoughts and exploring alternative explanations. Let's start by looking at the evidence for and against the thought that the club didn't like your work or didn't think you were good enough.\n\nPatient: I guess there isn't really any direct evidence that they didn't like my work, since they never actually saw it. I didn't submit any photos with my initial inquiry. As for evidence against that thought, well, I have received positive feedback on my photography from friends and family in the past, so that suggests that I do have some talent.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Mei. You've identified a key piece of evidence against the negative thought \u2013 the fact that you've received positive feedback on your photography before. Let's consider some alternative explanations for why you haven't heard back from the club yet. What are some other possibilities?\n\nPatient: It's possible that they just haven't had time to respond to my inquiry yet, like you mentioned earlier. Or maybe my email got lost in their inbox, or went to their spam folder. It's also possible that they're not actively recruiting new members right now, or that they have a specific process for joining that I'm not aware of.\n\nTherapist: Those are all very plausible explanations, Mei. It's important to consider these alternatives before jumping to the conclusion that their lack of response is a reflection of your talent or worthiness. This is a great example of how challenging negative thoughts and considering alternative explanations can help us avoid falling into the trap of negative self-talk and self-doubt.\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be helpful. It's just hard to remember to do that in the moment, when I'm feeling rejected or discouraged.\n\nTherapist: That's a very common challenge, Mei. It takes practice to develop the habit of challenging negative thoughts and considering alternatives. One helpful tool is to use a thought record, like the one we've been working on in our sessions. When you notice yourself having a strong emotional reaction to a situation, take a moment to write down the situation, your emotions, and the thoughts that are going through your mind. Then, take some time to evaluate the evidence for and against those thoughts and generate alternative explanations.\n\nPatient: I have been trying to use the thought record, but sometimes it feels like a lot of work to go through that process every time I have a negative thought.\n\nTherapist: It's true that using a thought record can feel like a lot of work at first, but with practice, it becomes more automatic. It's also okay to start small \u2013 you don't have to challenge every single negative thought. Try to focus on the ones that are causing you the most distress or having the biggest impact on your mood and behavior.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to focus on using the thought record for the really intense negative thoughts, and see if that helps.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Mei. Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate all negative thoughts \u2013 everyone has them from time to time. The goal is to develop the skills to manage those thoughts in a healthier way, so they don't have as much power over your emotions and behaviors.\n\nPatient: I think I'm starting to understand that better now. It's not about being perfect or never having negative thoughts, it's about learning how to deal with them in a more balanced way.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Mei. You're making great progress in understanding and applying these concepts. As you continue to practice these skills, you'll likely find that your negative thoughts have less of an impact on your mood and your ability to engage in activities that are important to you, like photography.\n\nPatient: That's encouraging to hear. I know I still have a lot of work to do, but I feel like I'm starting to make some progress.\n\nTherapist: You absolutely are making progress, Mei. Remember to give yourself credit for the efforts you're making and the small victories along the way. Every time you challenge a negative thought or engage in an activity that aligns with your values, you're taking a step towards improving your mental health and wellbeing.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder to celebrate the small victories. I think that's something I often forget to do.\n\nTherapist: It's a common habit to focus on what we perceive as failures or shortcomings, rather than acknowledging our successes and progress. That's why it's so important to make a conscious effort to recognize and celebrate the small victories, even if it feels uncomfortable at first.\n\nPatient: I'll try to make more of an effort to do that. It's just hard sometimes, when I'm feeling down or discouraged.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, Mei. When we're feeling down, it can be difficult to see our own progress and successes. That's why it can be helpful to have someone else, like a therapist or a supportive friend or family member, to help you identify and celebrate those small victories.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. Maybe I can talk to my wife or a close friend about some of the progress I've been making, and get their perspective on it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Mei. Sharing your progress with someone you trust can be a powerful way to reinforce your successes and get support and encouragement along the way. It can also help you maintain perspective and avoid getting stuck in negative thought patterns.\n\nPatient: I think that could be really helpful. I'll try to make a point of sharing my progress with someone this week, even if it feels a little uncomfortable at first.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Mei. Remember, it's okay if it feels uncomfortable at first \u2013 that's a normal part of the process of making changes and trying new things. The more you practice sharing your progress and celebrating your successes, the more natural it will start to feel.\n\nPatient: I'll keep that in mind. Thank you for the encouragement and support.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mei. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, change is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Let's continue to work together to build on the progress you've already made and help you develop even more skills and strategies for managing your depression and improving your overall wellbeing.",
