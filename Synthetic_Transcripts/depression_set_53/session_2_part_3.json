  "transcript": "Therapist: You've shown a lot of insight and openness today, Mei. As we start to think about your goals for therapy, what areas of your life do you most want to work on? We've touched on your relationships, your feelings about retirement, and your struggles with negative thoughts. Which of these feel most pressing to you right now?\n\nPatient: I think my relationships are the biggest source of pain for me, especially with my wife and kids. I feel so disconnected from them, and I don't know how to fix it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great place to start. We can absolutely focus on building healthier communication and connection in those relationships. Another area we often address in CBT is behaviors - the things we do or don't do that impact our mood and relationships. For example, you mentioned that you've been withdrawing from social activities and neglecting your physical health. Those could be important areas to work on as well. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I know I need to make changes in those areas. I just feel stuck, like I don't have the energy or motivation to do anything differently.\n\nTherapist: That feeling of being stuck is something we can work on shifting. In CBT, we often use something called \"behavioral activation\" to help with that. It involves gradually increasing activities that give us a sense of accomplishment or pleasure, even if we don't feel motivated at first. The idea is that the more we engage in those activities, the more our mood and energy levels can start to improve. It's a way of kick-starting that upward spiral. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: It does. I can see how pushing myself to do more could help. I'm just not sure where to start.\n\nTherapist: That's where we can work together to set small, achievable goals and build up from there. And one of the ways we do that in CBT is through homework assignments between sessions. These are small tasks or exercises that you practice on your own to start building new habits and skills. The thought record you did this past week is an example of that. How did you find that experience?\n\nPatient: It was challenging, but also eye-opening. I hadn't realized how often I was having those negative thoughts until I started writing them down.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you found it helpful. As we go forward, we'll continue to use homework to practice the skills we discuss in session, like challenging cognitive distortions or engaging in behavioral activation. The idea is to start applying these tools in your daily life, so that you can start to see changes in your mood and relationships. How do you feel about incorporating homework into our work together?",
