  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in on how you've been doing since our last session. How has your mood been, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the grounding techniques and mindfulness meditation more consistently. It's been challenging at times, but I have noticed some improvement in my ability to manage my emotions when I feel overwhelmed.\n\nHowever, I've also been struggling with feelings of loneliness and disconnection. Even though I know I should reach out to others, it's difficult for me to take that first step. I often find myself making excuses not to engage with people, and then I feel guilty about it afterwards.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the grounding techniques and mindfulness meditation, Mei. Consistency can be challenging, but the fact that you're noticing some improvement is a positive sign. \n\nRegarding your feelings of loneliness and disconnection, that's a common struggle for many people, especially when dealing with depression. It's important that we continue to work on building your support system and finding ways for you to connect with others in a way that feels comfortable for you.\n\nFor today's session, I'd like to propose the following agenda:\n\n1. Review your progress with the homework assignments and discuss any challenges or successes you've experienced.\n2. Explore your feelings of loneliness and disconnection in more depth, and identify some small steps you can take to start building connections with others.\n3. Introduce the concept of cognitive distortions and discuss how they might be contributing to your negative thought patterns.\n4. Develop a plan for the coming week, including specific goals and homework assignments.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or focus on during our session today?",
