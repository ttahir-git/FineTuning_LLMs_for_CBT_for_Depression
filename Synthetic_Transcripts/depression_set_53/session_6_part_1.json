  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mei, it's great to see you again for our sixth session. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last meeting. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few limitations as your AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate might be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interactions are text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about the limitations. I understand. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the distress tolerance techniques you taught me. The deep breathing and grounding exercises have been helpful when I start feeling overwhelmed. However, I'm still struggling with negative thoughts about my relationships and feeling stuck in life.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the distress tolerance techniques have provided some relief. It's common to still experience negative thoughts even as you make progress. We can continue working on challenging those thoughts today. Before we set our agenda, can you share a bit more about your experiences with the homework assignments from our last session?\n\nPatient: I've been keeping thought records and trying to schedule pleasant activities. The mood monitoring worksheet has helped me notice patterns in my emotions. I went for a walk in the park and attended a photography exhibit, which lifted my mood temporarily. However, the feelings of sadness and being stuck always seem to creep back in.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been consistent with the homework and have noticed some improvements in your mood, even if they're temporary. Noticing these patterns is an important step in understanding your emotions. Today, let's focus on exploring the negative thoughts that keep resurfacing and practice modifying them. We can also discuss additional coping strategies for when you feel stuck. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I really want to work on changing these negative thought patterns. I feel like they're holding me back from making real progress.\n\nTherapist: I understand how frustrating those negative thoughts can be. Let's start by looking at your thought records. Can you share an example of a situation that triggered negative thoughts about your relationships or feeling stuck?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I called my daughter to catch up, but she seemed distracted and rushed to get off the phone. I started thinking that she doesn't value our relationship and that I've failed as a mother.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. Let's break it down using the thought record. In the situation column, we have the phone call with your daughter. What emotions did you experience during and after the call?",
