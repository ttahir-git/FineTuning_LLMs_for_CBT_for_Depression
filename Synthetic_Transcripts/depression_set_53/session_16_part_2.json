  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's dive deeper into your experience with the homework. You mentioned that using the communication strategies with Lisa felt a bit awkward at first. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm not used to being so direct about my feelings. In my family growing up, we didn't really talk about emotions openly. So, when I tried to use \"I\" statements and express myself more openly with Lisa, it felt uncomfortable and vulnerable.\n\nTherapist: It makes sense that it would feel uncomfortable and vulnerable, especially if it's different from what you're used to. I'm wondering, though, what was the outcome of pushing through that initial discomfort?\n\nPatient: After the initial awkwardness, I felt like we were actually able to understand each other better. Lisa seemed to appreciate me opening up, and it led to a more productive conversation than we've had in a while.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Mei. Even though it was challenging, it sounds like using those communication strategies led to a more positive outcome in your conversation with Lisa. This is a great example of how challenging our initial thoughts and discomfort can lead to growth and better connections.\n\nPatient: You're right. It's just hard to remember that in the moment when I'm feeling vulnerable.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's why we practice. The more you do it, the easier it becomes to remember the potential benefits, even when it's uncomfortable. Now, let's talk about your photography goal. You mentioned setting aside 30 minutes each day to work on capturing the beauty in everyday moments. How has that been going?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenge to make the time for it every day, but when I do, I really enjoy it. I've started noticing things I didn't before, like the way the light hits a certain object or the colors in someone's garden. It's like I'm seeing the world through a new lens.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Mei. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and help you see the world in a different way can be so powerful in improving your overall mood and outlook. I'm curious, have you noticed any changes in your thoughts or feelings after spending time on photography?\n\nPatient: I have, actually. When I'm focused on capturing a moment, I'm not thinking about my worries or stresses. It's like a little escape, and I feel more relaxed and content afterwards.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. Engaging in activities that promote mindfulness and bring a sense of accomplishment can help shift our thoughts and feelings in a more positive direction. It's great that you're noticing these benefits from your photography practice.\n\nPatient: It's definitely encouraging me to keep going with it, even when it's hard to find the time.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Mei. Remember, it's okay if you don't always meet your goal perfectly. The important thing is that you're making progress and noticing the positive impact on your well-being.\n\nPatient: You're right. I need to give myself some grace and celebrate the progress I've made.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Celebrating your progress, no matter how small, is an important part of the journey. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about some of the thoughts and beliefs that might be contributing to your depression. In our previous sessions, we've touched on the idea of cognitive distortions \u2013 those inaccurate thought patterns that can fuel negative emotions. I'm wondering if you've noticed any of these distortions showing up in your thought records or in your day-to-day life?\n\nPatient: I have, actually. One that I've noticed a lot is black-and-white thinking. I tend to see things as either all good or all bad, with no in-between. Like, if I don't meet my photography goal perfectly, I feel like a failure, even though I know that's not true.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of black-and-white thinking, Mei. When we engage in this type of thinking, we don't leave room for the nuances and complexities of life. It's either perfect or terrible, with no middle ground. The problem with this is that it can lead to feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness when we inevitably fall short of perfection.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. So, how do I combat this type of thinking?\n\nTherapist: One way to challenge black-and-white thinking is to look for the shades of gray \u2013 the evidence that contradicts the all-or-nothing perspective. For example, instead of seeing yourself as a failure for not meeting your photography goal perfectly, you could acknowledge the progress you've made and the effort you've put in, even if it's not perfect.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I need to practice looking for those shades of gray.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Another strategy is to use more balanced and nuanced language when talking to yourself. Instead of using extreme words like \"always\" or \"never,\" try to use more moderate phrases like \"sometimes\" or \"occasionally.\"\n\nPatient: I can see how that would help. It's just hard to catch myself in the moment.\n\nTherapist: It takes practice, just like any other skill. The more you do it, the easier it becomes. Another cognitive distortion that often goes hand-in-hand with black-and-white thinking is disqualifying the positive \u2013 essentially, dismissing or minimizing positive experiences or qualities.\n\nPatient: Oh, I definitely do that. Like, if I receive a compliment on my photography, I might brush it off and focus on the negative instead.\n\nTherapist: That's a perfect example. When we disqualify the positive, we're essentially filtering out the good and focusing only on the negative, which can contribute to feelings of depression and low self-worth.\n\nPatient: So, how do I stop doing that?\n\nTherapist: One way is to practice accepting compliments and positive feedback at face value, without trying to minimize or dismiss them. When someone pays you a compliment, try to simply say \"thank you\" and allow yourself to feel the positive emotion, rather than immediately deflecting or downplaying it.\n\nPatient: That's going to be tough for me, but I can see how it would help.\n\nTherapist: It's definitely a challenge, but with practice, it gets easier. Another strategy is to actively look for the positive in situations, even if there are also negative aspects. This doesn't mean ignoring the negative, but rather acknowledging both the positive and the negative, and trying to find a more balanced perspective.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's about finding balance, rather than just focusing on one side or the other.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's about acknowledging the full range of your experiences and emotions, rather than getting stuck in extremes. As we continue to work together, we'll keep practicing these strategies for challenging cognitive distortions and finding more balanced, realistic ways of thinking.\n\nPatient: I'm looking forward to continuing this work. It's not easy, but I can see how it's helping me already.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that, Mei. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. The important thing is that you keep showing up for yourself and putting in the effort to make changes.",
