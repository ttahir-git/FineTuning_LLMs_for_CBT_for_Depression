  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I think I'd like to prioritize discussing the difficulty in accepting positive feedback about my photography, as that's been a significant challenge for me lately.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can prioritize that. Let's start by exploring your experience with accepting positive feedback. Can you tell me about a recent situation where you received compliments on your photography and how it made you feel?\n\nPatient: Well, last week I shared some of my recent photographs with my veterans support group, and several people commented on how much they liked them. One person even said that my photos captured the essence of our shared experiences in the military. While I appreciated their kind words, I found myself downplaying the compliments and focusing on the flaws in my work.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. It's interesting that even when presented with positive feedback, your mind tends to focus on the negative aspects of your work. This could be related to some of the cognitive distortions we've discussed before, such as discounting the positive or magnification of the negative. Let's try to understand this better. When you receive a compliment on your photography, what thoughts go through your mind?\n\nPatient: I often think that people are just being nice, and they don't really mean what they say. I also tend to compare my work to that of professional photographers and feel like I don't measure up. I guess I have a hard time believing that my photos are actually good.\n\nTherapist: Those are important insights, Mei. It seems like there might be some underlying beliefs contributing to your difficulty in accepting positive feedback. We've talked before about the relationship between automatic thoughts, intermediate beliefs, and core beliefs. Do you remember that?\n\nPatient: Yes, I remember. Automatic thoughts are the initial thoughts that pop into our minds, intermediate beliefs are the rules or assumptions we have, and core beliefs are the deep-seated beliefs we hold about ourselves, others, and the world.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Now, let's try to identify some of the intermediate and core beliefs that might be influencing your difficulty in accepting positive feedback. We can use the downward arrow technique for this. I'll ask you a series of questions, and I'd like you to answer them as honestly as possible. Are you ready?\n\nPatient: Yes, I'm ready.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's start with the thought, \"People are just being nice, and they don't really mean what they say.\" If that were true, what would that mean to you?\n\nPatient: It would mean that my photography isn't actually good, and people are just trying to spare my feelings.\n\nTherapist: And if your photography isn't actually good, what would that mean?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not talented or skilled enough to be a good photographer.\n\nTherapist: And if you're not talented or skilled enough to be a good photographer, what would that mean about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not good enough or worthy of praise and recognition.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for being so open and honest, Mei. It seems like we've identified a potential core belief: \"I'm not good enough or worthy of praise and recognition.\" This belief could be contributing to your difficulty in accepting positive feedback. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: It makes sense, but it's a bit uncomfortable to think about. I've always prided myself on being independent and self-reliant, so the idea of needing validation from others is challenging for me.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Mei. It's common for people to feel uncomfortable when confronting their core beliefs, especially if they challenge long-held values or ways of thinking. However, recognizing these beliefs is an important step in the process of change. By understanding the root causes of your difficulty in accepting positive feedback, we can start to work on reframing those beliefs and developing more balanced and adaptive ways of thinking.",
