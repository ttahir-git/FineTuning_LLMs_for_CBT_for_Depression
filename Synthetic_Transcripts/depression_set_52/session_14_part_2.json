  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I'm curious about the \"Reframing Core Beliefs\" technique you mentioned. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nTherapist: Certainly, Maria. Reframing Core Beliefs is a technique that helps us develop more balanced and adaptive beliefs about ourselves. Our core beliefs are deeply held beliefs that often develop early in life and can influence how we perceive ourselves, others, and the world around us. When these beliefs are negative or unrealistic, they can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety.\n\nThe first step in reframing core beliefs is to identify the negative beliefs that are contributing to your distress. We've already started this process by exploring some of your beliefs related to your academic performance and self-worth. Once we've identified a negative core belief, we can start to gather evidence against it using techniques like the Positive Data Log.\n\nThe next step is to develop a more balanced and adaptive belief that takes into account the evidence we've gathered. For example, instead of believing \"I'm not good enough,\" we might reframe that belief to something like \"I have strengths and weaknesses, and I'm working on improving myself.\"\n\nFinally, we practice reinforcing this new belief by intentionally focusing on the evidence that supports it and engaging in behaviors that align with it. This can help us start to shift our overall perspective and reduce the impact of negative core beliefs on our emotions and behaviors.\n\nDoes this help explain the concept of Reframing Core Beliefs? Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything you'd like me to clarify.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's kind of like challenging those negative thoughts we've been talking about, but on a deeper level. I think I could definitely benefit from working on some of those negative core beliefs, especially around feeling like I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Maria. Reframing Core Beliefs builds on the work we've been doing with challenging negative thoughts, but it takes it a step further by addressing the underlying beliefs that fuel those thoughts. It's great that you're open to working on this.\n\nLet's start by looking at the Positive Data Log you've been keeping. Can you share some of the evidence you've gathered against the belief that you're not good enough?\n\nPatient: Well, I wrote down a few things. Like how I've been able to maintain good grades in my classes despite working part-time and dealing with my depression. And how my neighbors always compliment me on my cooking when I bring dishes to our potlucks.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples, Maria. Maintaining good grades while balancing work and your mental health is a significant accomplishment, and it shows your strength and resilience. And the compliments from your neighbors are evidence of your skills and the positive impact you have on others.\n\nAs we continue to gather evidence like this, we can start to develop a more balanced core belief. What do you think about reframing the belief \"I'm not good enough\" to something like \"I have valuable strengths and accomplishments, and I'm working on growing in other areas\"?\n\nPatient: I like that. It feels more realistic and less harsh than just saying I'm not good enough. But it's still hard to believe it sometimes, you know?\n\nTherapist: I completely understand, Maria. Changing our core beliefs is a process, and it takes time and practice. It's normal to have doubts and to struggle with fully believing the new belief at first. That's why we continue to gather evidence and intentionally focus on the things that support the new belief.\n\nOne way to reinforce the new belief is to engage in behaviors that align with it. For example, you could make a point to acknowledge your accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem, and to celebrate your strengths. You could also challenge yourself to take on new opportunities for growth, like joining a study group or trying a new hobby.\n\nWhat do you think about incorporating some of these behaviors into your homework for the next week? We can come up with a specific plan together.",
