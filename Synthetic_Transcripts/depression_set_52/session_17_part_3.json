  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you've been having the thought \"My children don't care about me anymore.\" Let's explore this thought further. Can you tell me about a recent situation that triggered this thought?\n\nPatient: Last week, I called my daughter to catch up, and she seemed distracted during our conversation. She said she was busy with work and couldn't talk for long. It made me feel like she didn't want to make time for me.\n\nTherapist: I can understand how that would be painful for you. Let's examine the evidence for and against the thought \"My children don't care about me anymore.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, my daughter seemed disinterested in our conversation, and my son hasn't returned my calls lately. I feel like they're both pulling away from me.\n\nTherapist: I see. Now, let's consider the evidence against this thought. Have there been times when your children have shown that they do care about you?\n\nPatient: I suppose there have been. My daughter did call me on my birthday, and my son sent me a thoughtful gift. They also both came to visit me last Christmas.\n\nTherapist: Those are important examples of your children showing care and concern for you. It's possible that their recent behavior is due to factors unrelated to their feelings for you. Let's try to reframe the original thought in a more balanced way. How could you state it differently, taking into account the evidence for and against it?\n\nPatient: I could say something like, \"Even though my children seem distant at times, they have shown that they care about me through their actions and words. Their busy lives may be affecting their availability, but it doesn't necessarily mean they don't care.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Maria! It acknowledges your feelings while also considering alternative explanations for your children's behavior. How does this new thought make you feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel a bit better. I still wish I could have more meaningful conversations with them, but I don't feel as hurt by their actions.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Maria. You've done an excellent job of applying cognitive restructuring to this negative thought about your children. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to challenge negative thoughts and find more balanced perspectives.",
