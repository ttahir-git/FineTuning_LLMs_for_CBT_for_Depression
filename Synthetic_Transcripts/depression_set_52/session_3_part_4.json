  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up today's session, let's review the goals and treatment plan we've established. Your goals are to practice thought challenging and engage in one stress-reducing activity per day, establish a consistent sleep schedule aiming for 7-8 hours of sleep per night, attend one volleyball game per week, reach out to at least one friend or neighbor per week, and write in your journal for at least 10 minutes, three times per week. We'll work on these goals together using CBT techniques such as thought recording, behavioral activation, and problem-solving.\n\nFor your homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing thought recording. Try to identify and challenge at least one negative thought per day using the skills we discussed. Additionally, engage in one stress-reducing activity each day, such as deep breathing exercises or going for a walk. Finally, attend your weekly choir practice and write in your journal three times this week, focusing on processing your emotions related to your divorce and family estrangement.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about your homework or the treatment plan?\n\nPatient: No, I think I understand the homework and treatment plan. I'm looking forward to putting these skills into practice.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns between sessions, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you throughout this process.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Reviewed and finalized the CBT conceptualization of Maria's depression, highlighting the connection between her negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\n- Set specific, measurable goals for therapy, including practicing thought challenging, establishing a consistent sleep schedule, increasing engagement in enjoyable activities, strengthening social connections, and processing unresolved family issues through journaling.\n- Introduced the thought recording technique and practiced challenging cognitive distortions using examples from Maria's week.\n- Discussed the importance of self-compassion and resilience in the face of setbacks and challenges.\n- Assigned homework: Continue practicing thought recording (identifying and challenging at least one negative thought per day), engage in one stress-reducing activity each day, attend weekly choir practice, and write in a journal three times this week, focusing on emotions related to divorce and family estrangement.\n- Maria's progress: Demonstrated increased insight into her thought patterns and a willingness to challenge cognitive distortions.
