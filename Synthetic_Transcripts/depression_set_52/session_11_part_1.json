  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Maria, it's great to see you again for session 11. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned, but it's been challenging. I've been feeling more overwhelmed and tired lately, and my depression symptoms seem to be fluctuating.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're being honest about your struggles, Maria. It's not uncommon to experience ups and downs throughout therapy. Can you tell me more about what's been contributing to your feelings of overwhelm and tiredness?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to keep up with my studies and the homework you assigned, but I feel like I'm not making much progress. I'm still having trouble sleeping, and I'm worried about my finances. It's just a lot to deal with right now.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stressors, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Let's take a moment to explore your emotions further. Can you identify any specific thoughts that have been running through your mind when you feel overwhelmed or tired?\n\nPatient: I keep thinking that I'm not good enough, and that I'll never be able to manage everything on my plate. I feel like I'm failing as a student and as a person.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Maria. Those thoughts seem to be connected to the core belief we've been working on challenging - the idea that you're not good enough. I'd like to propose that we focus on that belief in today's session, along with exploring some strategies to help you manage your stress and improve your sleep. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I really want to work on changing that belief, but it's hard.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it's challenging, but I believe you're making progress, even if it doesn't always feel that way. Let's set an agenda for today's session. I propose we start by reviewing your experience with the Positive Data Log and behavioral activation activities from your homework. Then, we can explore and challenge the core belief that you're not good enough, and discuss some strategies for managing stress and improving your sleep. Does that agenda work for you, or is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers everything. Let's start with reviewing my homework.",
