  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Maria, it's great to see you again for our 12th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the Core Belief Worksheet and practice the Progressive Muscle Relaxation technique. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I've also been singing in the choir, which has been a nice break from my studies and worries.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on the homework and finding some joy in singing with the choir. I'm curious to know more about your experience with the Core Belief Worksheet. What has been challenging about it, and what progress have you noticed?\n\nPatient: Well, it's been difficult to identify evidence against my core belief that I'm not good enough. I've been so focused on my flaws and mistakes for so long that it's hard to see anything else. But I've been trying to look for small things, like when I manage to complete an assignment or when someone compliments my singing. It's a slow process, but I think I'm starting to see that maybe I'm not as inadequate as I thought.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant insight, Maria. Challenging long-held core beliefs is indeed a gradual process, and it's okay to take small steps. Recognizing your accomplishments and positive qualities, even if they seem minor, is an essential part of building a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself. I'm glad you're starting to see some evidence against the belief that you're not good enough.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's still hard to believe sometimes, but I'm trying. The Progressive Muscle Relaxation has been helpful too. I've been doing it before bed, and I think it's helping me sleep a little better.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Maria. Improving your sleep quality is an important step in managing your depression symptoms. As we continue to work on challenging your core beliefs and developing healthier coping strategies, you may notice further improvements in your overall well-being.\n\nNow, let's set an agenda for today's session. We can review your Core Belief Worksheet in more detail, discuss your experience with the Progressive Muscle Relaxation, and explore how your thoughts and beliefs might be impacting your mood and behavior. We can also introduce a new technique called cognitive restructuring, which can help you challenge negative thoughts related to your studies and family relationships. What do you think about this plan, and is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me, Nova. I'm particularly interested in learning about cognitive restructuring, as I've been struggling with negative thoughts about my academic performance and my relationship with my children. I think it would be helpful to discuss that in more detail.",
