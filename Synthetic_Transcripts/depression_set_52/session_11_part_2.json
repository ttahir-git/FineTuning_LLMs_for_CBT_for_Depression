  "transcript": "Patient: Last session, you asked me to keep a Positive Data Log and engage in behavioral activation activities. I tried to do them, but it was hard to find evidence for new beliefs about myself.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Maria. Let's start by discussing your experience with the Positive Data Log. Can you share an entry from your log that you found particularly challenging?\n\nPatient: Well, I tried to write about a time when I received a good grade on a paper for my PhD program. I wanted to use it as evidence that I'm capable and competent. But then I started thinking that it was just one assignment, and it doesn't mean I'll be successful overall.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Maria. What you're describing is a common cognitive distortion called \"disqualifying the positive.\" It's when we dismiss or minimize positive experiences because they don't fit with our negative core beliefs. In this case, your core belief that you're not good enough is causing you to discount the evidence that contradicts it.\n\nPatient: I never thought about it that way before. So, how do I stop doing that?\n\nTherapist: One way to challenge this distortion is to consciously focus on the facts of the situation, rather than your interpretation of it. In this case, the fact is that you received a good grade on your paper, which is an accomplishment worth acknowledging. When you notice yourself discounting the positive, try to reframe your thoughts to focus on the objective evidence.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to do that next time.\n\nTherapist: Great! Now, let's discuss your experience with the behavioral activation activities. Were you able to engage in any activities that brought you a sense of joy, accomplishment, or connection?\n\nPatient: I did. I went to a choir practice at my church, and it felt really good to sing with others again. I noticed that I felt more energized and less lonely afterwards.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Maria! Engaging in activities that bring you joy and connection is an essential part of managing depression. It's great that you noticed the positive impact it had on your mood and energy levels. Let's continue to incorporate these types of activities into your routine.\n\nPatient: I'd like that. I forgot how much I love singing.\n\nTherapist: Now, I'd like to explore the core belief that you're not good enough. This belief seems to be at the root of many of your negative thoughts and feelings. Can you tell me more about how this belief developed?\n\nPatient: I think it started when I was young. My parents always expected perfection from me, and I felt like I could never meet their standards. Then, when my marriage ended, I felt like a failure as a wife and mother. It just reinforced the idea that I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Maria. It's common for core beliefs to develop early in life and be reinforced by significant experiences. The good news is that core beliefs can be changed, even if it takes time and effort. One way to start challenging this belief is to examine the evidence for and against it.\n\nPatient: How do I do that?\n\nTherapist: We can use a technique called the \"Core Belief Worksheet.\" It involves writing down your core belief and then listing evidence that supports and refutes it. The goal is to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective. Would you like to try this together now?\n\nPatient: Yes, I'm willing to give it a try.",
