I know we covered a lot of ground, and I want to acknowledge the effort you've put into challenging your core belief and learning new techniques. Before we wrap up, I'd like to check in on how you're feeling now.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also hopeful. It's good to have some new tools to work with, and I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Maria. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have ups and downs. What's important is that you keep practicing these techniques and being kind to yourself along the way.\n\nPatient: I'll try to remember that. Thank you, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Maria. Now, let's discuss your homework for the next session. I'd like you to continue working on the Core Belief Worksheet, adding evidence for and against your core belief as you notice it throughout the week. Also, practice the Progressive Muscle Relaxation technique daily, ideally before bed, to help manage stress and improve your sleep. Finally, continue engaging in behavioral activation activities that bring you joy and connection, like singing in the choir.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll do my best to complete the homework. I'm looking forward to our next session.\n\nTherapist: I'm looking forward to it as well, Maria. Remember that I'm here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns between now and our next session, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Maria's experience with the Positive Data Log and behavioral activation activities from her homework\n  - Explored and challenged Maria's core belief of not being good enough using the Core Belief Worksheet\n  - Introduced the Progressive Muscle Relaxation technique to help manage stress and improve sleep\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (ongoing)\n  - Behavioral activation (ongoing)\n  - Problem-solving (ongoing)\n  - Self-compassionate journaling (ongoing)\n  - Distress tolerance techniques (deep breathing, mindfulness, grounding exercises) (previously introduced, ongoing)\n  - Cognitive restructuring (applied to self-critical thoughts related to perceived failure as a mother and academic performance)\n  - Sleep hygiene education and planning (introduced in previous session, ongoing)\n  - Downward arrow technique (introduced in previous session, practiced in this session)\n  - Positive Data Log (introduced in previous session, reviewed in this session)\n  - Core Belief Worksheet (introduced in this session)\n  - Progressive Muscle Relaxation (introduced in this session)\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue working on the Core Belief Worksheet, adding evidence for and against the core belief of not being good enough\n  - Practice the Progressive Muscle Relaxation technique daily, ideally before bed\n  - Engage in behavioral activation activities that bring joy and connection, like singing in the choir\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details:\n  - Maria demonstrated progress in understanding and challenging her core belief, as well as learning new techniques to manage stress and improve sleep\n  - She expressed feeling hopeful but also tired and overwhelmed at times\n  - Depression symptoms, such as persistent sadness and feelings of worthlessness, remain present but may be gradually improving\n  - Maria's love for singing and neighborhood connections continue to be potential sources of support\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - The belief that Maria is not good enough contributes to feelings of guilt and shame, which may be intermediate and core beliefs.
