  "transcript": "Patient: Thank you for explaining cognitive restructuring, Nova. It makes sense to me, and I can see how challenging my negative thoughts could help improve my mood. One situation where I think this technique could be useful is when I'm working on a difficult assignment for my classes. I often get stuck in negative thought patterns, like \"I'm not smart enough to figure this out\" or \"I'm going to fail this assignment.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Maria. When you're working on a challenging assignment, those negative thoughts can really impact your motivation and ability to concentrate. Let's practice applying cognitive restructuring to this situation.\n\nFirst, let's identify the emotions that come up when you're struggling with an assignment and the intensity of those emotions. What do you typically feel in those moments?\n\nPatient: I usually feel frustrated, maybe around 75, and also anxious, like a 60. I worry that I won't be able to complete the assignment or that I'll do poorly on it.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so frustration at 75 and anxiety at 60. Now, let's look at the automatic thoughts that contribute to these emotions. You mentioned a couple already: \"I'm not smart enough to figure this out\" and \"I'm going to fail this assignment.\" Are there any other thoughts that tend to come up in these situations?\n\nPatient: Sometimes I think, \"Everyone else in the class is probably understanding this better than me\" or \"I shouldn't be in this program if I can't handle the assignments.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are common thoughts for many students, Maria. Let's focus on the thought \"I'm not smart enough to figure this out\" and examine the evidence for and against it. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, the fact that I'm struggling with the assignment in the first place. If I were smarter, I wouldn't have so much trouble with it.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against this thought? Have there been times when you've successfully completed challenging assignments in the past?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been a few times when I've struggled with an assignment at first but then figured it out after putting in more effort. And I have gotten good grades on some difficult projects before.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're not smart enough. It shows that you are capable of understanding complex material, even if it takes some extra effort. Now, let's try to reframe this thought in a more balanced way. What's an alternative thought that takes into account both the evidence for and against the original thought?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"Just because I'm struggling with this assignment doesn't mean I'm not smart enough. I've succeeded in challenging situations before, and I can do it again if I keep trying.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and adaptive way to view the situation. How do you think this alternative thought would impact your emotions if you were to fully believe it?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel less frustrated and anxious. Maybe more like a 40 or 50 instead of 60 or 75.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in your emotional response. By challenging the negative thought and reframing it in a more balanced way, you're able to reduce the intensity of your frustration and anxiety. This can help you approach the assignment with a more positive mindset and potentially improve your ability to concentrate and persist.\n\nAs you continue to practice cognitive restructuring, you'll likely find it easier to identify and challenge negative thoughts in the moment. It's a skill that takes time to develop, but with practice, it can become a powerful tool for managing your mood and reducing distress.\n\nNow, let's explore how this technique might apply to your thoughts about your relationship with your children. Can you think of a recent situation where you had negative thoughts related to this topic?",
