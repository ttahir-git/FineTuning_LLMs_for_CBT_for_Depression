  "transcript": "Patient: I can think of an example from earlier this week. I was feeling really overwhelmed with my coursework and I started thinking \"I'll never be able to keep up with this program, I'm not smart enough.\" That thought made me feel really discouraged and hopeless, so I ended up procrastinating on my work instead of tackling it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how our thoughts can influence our feelings and behaviors, Maria. The thought \"I'll never be able to keep up with this program, I'm not smart enough\" led to feelings of discouragement and hopelessness, which in turn led to the behavior of procrastinating on your work.\n\nLet's apply some cognitive restructuring to this thought. What evidence do you have that supports the thought \"I'll never be able to keep up with this program, I'm not smart enough\"?\n\nPatient: Well, the evidence that supports it is that I have been struggling to keep up with the workload, and I've gotten behind on some assignments. And I do sometimes feel like I'm not understanding the material as well as I should be.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so there is some evidence that supports the thought. Now, what evidence do you have that goes against this thought?\n\nPatient: The evidence against it is that I have been able to complete most of the assignments, even if it's taken me longer than I'd like. And I have gotten positive feedback from my professors on some of my work. So even though I'm struggling, I am making some progress.\n\nTherapist: Great, so there is evidence on both sides of this thought. It's not entirely true that you'll never be able to keep up with the program, even though it feels that way sometimes. Based on this evidence, how could you reframe this thought in a more balanced and realistic way?\n\nPatient: I could reframe it as \"Even though I'm struggling with the workload, I have been able to complete most of my assignments and I've gotten positive feedback from my professors. It's going to be challenging, but I can keep making progress if I keep working at it.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Maria. It acknowledges the real challenges you're facing, but it also recognizes the progress you've made and the possibility of continuing to move forward. How does this reframed thought feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It feels more hopeful and motivating. The original thought made me feel like giving up, but the reframed thought makes me feel like I can keep trying, even if it's hard.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Maria. Reframing our thoughts in a more balanced and realistic way can have a big impact on our feelings and behaviors. When we believe that change is possible, we're more likely to take actions that move us in that direction.\n\nAs we're nearing the end of our session today, I want to check in on how you're feeling now. What thoughts and emotions are coming up for you?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also more hopeful than I was at the beginning of the session. I can see how these techniques can help me manage my depression symptoms, even though it's going to take practice. I'm also feeling a bit nervous about trying to apply these skills on my own, but I'm willing to keep working at it.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions right now, Maria. It's great that you're feeling more hopeful about managing your depression symptoms, and it's also okay to feel nervous about applying these skills on your own. Remember that it's a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the Positive Data Log and cognitive restructuring techniques we've been working on. Try to notice when you're having negative thoughts, and practice looking at the evidence for and against those thoughts and coming up with more balanced reframes.\n\nI'd also like you to try setting up a regular phone or video call with your children, using the communication strategies we discussed today. Remember to use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and needs, and to practice active listening and empathy during your conversations.\n\nFinally, I'd like you to reflect on your progress in therapy so far and any goals you have for the future. What changes have you noticed in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors since we started working together? What areas do you want to continue working on?\n\nPatient: Okay, I will keep practicing the Positive Data Log and cognitive restructuring. I'll also try to set up a regular call with my children and use the communication strategies we discussed.\n\nIn terms of my progress, I think I've gotten better at noticing my negative thoughts and challenging them, even though it's still hard sometimes. I've also noticed that I'm a bit more willing to reach out to others for support, like my neighbors and classmates. In the future, I want to keep working on managing my depression symptoms and building stronger relationships with my children and others.\n\nTherapist: Those are great insights, Maria. It's clear that you've been making progress in noticing and challenging your negative thoughts, and in reaching out for support when you need it. It's also great that you have goals for continuing to work on your depression symptoms and relationships.\n\nWe'll continue to work on these goals together in our future sessions. For next time, let's plan to review your experience with the homework, particularly the Positive Data Log, cognitive restructuring, and communication with your children. We can also continue to explore and challenge your negative core beliefs, and introduce any additional CBT techniques that might be helpful.\n\nBefore we end today, do you have any final thoughts or questions you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you for your support and guidance, Nova. I appreciate it.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Maria. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember to take care of yourself this week, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. I look forward to seeing you at our next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Maria's experience with the homework and the phone call with her children\n  - Explored Maria's relationship with her children and strategies for improving communication\n  - Practiced cognitive restructuring and \"I\" statements\n  - Checked in on Maria's current mood and progress in therapy\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (ongoing)\n  - Emotion wheel (previously introduced, not discussed in this session)\n  - Cognitive restructuring (practiced in this session)\n  - Positive Data Log (reviewed in this session)\n  - Behavioral experiment (reviewed in this session)\n  - Downward arrow technique (previously introduced, not used in this session)\n  - Identifying intermediate and core beliefs (discussed in this session)\n  - Reframing Core Beliefs (introduced in this session)\n  - Behavioral activation (previously introduced, discussed in this session)\n  - Self-compassionate journaling (previously introduced, discussed in this session)\n  - Distress tolerance techniques (previously introduced, not discussed in this session)\n  - Sleep hygiene education and planning (previously introduced, not discussed in this session)\n  - Progressive Muscle Relaxation (previously introduced, not discussed in this session)\n  - \"I\" statements (introduced in this session)\n  - Active listening and empathy (introduced in this session)\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue practicing the Positive Data Log and cognitive restructuring techniques\n  - Set up a regular phone or video call with children and practice using \"I\" statements, active listening, and empathy\n  - Reflect on progress in therapy so far and goals for the future\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details:\n  - Maria demonstrated progress in noticing and challenging negative thoughts, and in reaching out for support\n  - She expressed feeling hopeful about managing her depression symptoms, but also nervous about applying skills on her own\n  - Depression symptoms, such as persistent sadness and feelings of worthlessness, remain present but may be gradually improving\n  - Maria's love for singing and neighborhood connections continue to be potential sources of support\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - The belief that Maria is not good enough contributes to feelings of guilt and shame, which may be intermediate and core beliefs.
