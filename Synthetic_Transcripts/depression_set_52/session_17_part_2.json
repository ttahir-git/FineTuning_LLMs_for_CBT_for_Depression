  "transcript": "Patient: I've been having thoughts like \"I'm not smart enough to complete this program\" and \"My children don't care about me anymore.\" These thoughts have been bringing down my mood and making it hard to focus on my studies.\n\nTherapist: I understand how those thoughts can be distressing and impact your mood. Let's explore them further. When you have the thought \"I'm not smart enough to complete this program,\" what emotions do you experience?\n\nPatient: I feel sad, discouraged, and sometimes even hopeless. I start to doubt myself and my abilities.\n\nTherapist: Those are difficult emotions to experience. Can you identify any situations or triggers that tend to lead to these thoughts and feelings?\n\nPatient: It usually happens when I'm struggling with an assignment or when I receive feedback that isn't as positive as I'd hoped. I start to question whether I have what it takes to succeed in the program.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Maria. Recognizing the situations that trigger these thoughts is an important step in challenging them. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm not smart enough to complete this program.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, sometimes I struggle with understanding the course material, and I don't always get the grades I aim for. I see other students who seem to grasp the concepts more easily than I do.\n\nTherapist: I see. Now, let's consider the evidence against this thought. What are some reasons to believe that you are capable of completing the program?\n\nPatient: I guess I have made it this far in the program, and I've overcome challenges in the past. My professors have also given me positive feedback on some of my work.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Those are significant pieces of evidence that support your ability to succeed in the program. Let's try to reframe the original thought in a more balanced way. How could you state it differently, taking into account the evidence for and against it?\n\nPatient: I could say something like, \"Even though I sometimes struggle with the course material, I have made progress in the program and received positive feedback from my professors. With continued effort and support, I can complete the program.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Maria! It acknowledges the challenges you face while also recognizing your strengths and the progress you've made. How does this new thought make you feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel more hopeful and motivated. I still recognize the difficulties, but I also see that I have the ability to overcome them.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Maria. You've done an excellent job of applying cognitive restructuring to this negative thought. Let's continue to practice this skill with other thoughts that contribute to your low mood, like the one about your children.",
