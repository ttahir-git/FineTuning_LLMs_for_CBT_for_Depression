  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for the CBT session transcript with Maria:\n\nPatient: When I tried to write the self-compassionate journal entry, I found it really difficult to be kind to myself. I kept thinking about how my divorce affected my children and how I wasn't there for them when they needed me most. I feel like I failed as a mother, and it's hard to forgive myself for that.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that you're finding it challenging to practice self-compassion, especially when it comes to such a sensitive and emotionally charged topic. Many people struggle with being kind to themselves, particularly when they feel they've made mistakes or fallen short in some way. The fact that you're acknowledging these feelings and trying to work through them is a significant step in itself.\n\nWhen we engage in self-compassion, we're not trying to dismiss or minimize our mistakes or the pain we may have caused others. Instead, we're recognizing that we're human, and like all humans, we're imperfect and make mistakes. We're also acknowledging that we deserve kindness and understanding, even in the face of our imperfections.\n\nCan you tell me more about what specifically came up for you when you tried to write the journal entry? What thoughts or feelings made it difficult to be self-compassionate?\n\nPatient: I kept thinking about how my children must have felt during the divorce, how confused and hurt they must have been. I remember my daughter crying and asking me why I was leaving, and I didn't have a good answer for her. I feel like I abandoned them when they needed me most, and I can't forgive myself for that. I know I'm human and I make mistakes, but this feels like more than just a mistake. It feels like a fundamental failure as a mother.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Maria. I can hear how much pain and guilt you're carrying around this issue. It's clear that you love your children deeply and that their well-being is incredibly important to you. I want to acknowledge and validate those feelings, as they're completely understandable given the circumstances.\n\nAt the same time, I wonder if we can explore some of the thoughts and beliefs that are contributing to your feelings of guilt and failure. Often, when we're struggling with self-compassion, it's because we're holding ourselves to unrealistic or unforgiving standards. We may believe that we should be perfect, that we should never make mistakes, or that our worth as a person is dependent on our performance in certain roles, like being a mother.\n\nDo any of those beliefs resonate with you? Can you identify any specific thoughts or beliefs that are making it hard for you to forgive yourself?\n\nPatient: I think I do have this belief that I should be a perfect mother, that I should always put my children's needs first and never do anything that might hurt them. I know that's not realistic, but it's how I feel. I also think I have this belief that if I'm not a good mother, then I'm not a good person. Like my whole worth is tied up in being a mother.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important insights, Maria. The beliefs you've identified - that you should be a perfect mother and that your worth is tied to your performance as a mother - are what we call intermediate beliefs in CBT. These beliefs are often formed early in life, based on our experiences and the messages we receive from others, and they can be very powerful in shaping how we feel about ourselves and how we respond to challenges.\n\nThe good news is that beliefs can be examined and changed, even if they feel very deeply ingrained. One way we can start to shift these beliefs is by looking at the evidence for and against them, and by considering alternative perspectives.\n\nFor example, let's take the belief that you should be a perfect mother. What would you say is the evidence for that belief? Is it realistic or fair to expect yourself to be perfect?\n\nPatient: I mean, I know that no one is perfect, and that everyone makes mistakes. But I feel like when it comes to being a mother, the stakes are so high. I'm responsible for these little human beings, and I feel like I should always put their needs first, even if it means sacrificing my own.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, and I think many parents can relate to that feeling of wanting to prioritize their children's needs above all else. At the same time, I wonder if we can consider the costs of holding yourself to that standard of perfection. What impact does it have on you to believe that you should always be a perfect mother?\n\nPatient: It's exhausting, honestly. I feel like I'm always falling short, always feeling guilty for not doing enough or being enough. It's like I'm constantly beating myself up for not being perfect.\n\nTherapist: That makes a lot of sense. Holding ourselves to unrealistic standards can lead to a lot of self-criticism and feelings of inadequacy. It can also make it hard for us to see and appreciate the things we are doing well, or the efforts we are making.\n\nAnother cost of perfectionism is that it can actually get in the way of us being the kind of parents we want to be. If we're constantly feeling guilty and inadequate, we may have less energy and patience for our children, and we may struggle to be emotionally present with them.\n\nWhat do you think would be a more realistic and compassionate standard to hold yourself to as a mother?",
