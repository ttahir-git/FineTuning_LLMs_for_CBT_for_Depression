  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Maria, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the thought records and using the emotion wheel. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I'm still struggling with feelings of sadness and worthlessness, but I've noticed that I'm a bit more aware of my thoughts and how they affect my mood.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some progress in your awareness of thoughts and their impact on your mood. It's also important to acknowledge that change takes time, and it's normal to still experience challenging emotions. Let's take a closer look at your experience with the homework. How did you find using the Positive Data Log and completing the behavioral experiment?\n\nPatient: The Positive Data Log was interesting. I tried to write down evidence against my negative core beliefs, but it was hard to come up with examples at first. As for the behavioral experiment, I was really nervous about intentionally aiming for a B on an assignment. I did it, though, and I was surprised that the world didn't end. My professor even gave me some positive feedback on the parts I did well.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant step, Maria. Engaging in the behavioral experiment despite your nerves shows courage and a willingness to challenge your beliefs. It's also great that you were able to identify some positive feedback from your professor. This experience can serve as evidence against the belief that you're not cut out for the program if you don't get an A on every assignment. What was it like for you to receive that positive feedback?\n\nPatient: It felt good to get the positive feedback, but I also felt a bit guilty, like I was somehow cheating the system by not giving it my all. I know that sounds silly, but it's how I felt.\n\nTherapist: It's not silly at all, Maria. Our feelings are valid, and it's important to acknowledge and explore them. This guilt you experienced could be related to an underlying belief about the need to be perfect or the fear of being judged. We can discuss this further and see how it connects to your core beliefs. For today's agenda, I propose we:\n\n1. Review your Positive Data Log and discuss your experience with the behavioral experiment in more detail.\n2. Explore the guilt you mentioned and how it relates to your beliefs about yourself and your academic performance.\n3. Introduce a new technique called \"Reframing Core Beliefs\" to help you develop more balanced and adaptive beliefs about yourself.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to prioritize or add?",
