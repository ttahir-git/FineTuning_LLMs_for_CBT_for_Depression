  "transcript": "Patient: I like the idea of incorporating those behaviors into my homework. It's just hard sometimes to remember to do those things, especially when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Maria. When we're feeling depressed, it can be challenging to remember to engage in self-care behaviors or to challenge our negative thoughts. That's why it can be helpful to create a specific plan for your homework, so you have a clear idea of what you're going to do and when.\n\nLet's break it down into smaller steps. What's one behavior you could engage in this week that would align with your new core belief, \"I have valuable strengths and accomplishments, and I'm working on growing in other areas\"?\n\nPatient: I guess one thing I could do is make a list of my accomplishments, both big and small. Like getting my master's degree, raising my kids, and even just getting out of bed on days when I'm feeling really low.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic idea, Maria. Creating a list of your accomplishments can be a powerful way to remind yourself of your strengths and to challenge the belief that you're not good enough. You can keep the list somewhere accessible, like on your phone or on a piece of paper in your wallet, so you can refer to it when you're feeling down.\n\nAnother behavior that could be helpful is to practice self-compassion. This means treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a good friend who was struggling. For example, if you catch yourself engaging in negative self-talk, you could pause and ask yourself, \"What would I say to a friend in this situation?\"\n\nWhat do you think about incorporating self-compassion into your homework this week?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I'm pretty hard on myself most of the time, so practicing self-compassion could be really helpful. I'll try to catch myself when I'm being negative and ask myself what I would say to a friend.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Maria. Practicing self-compassion can be challenging at first, but it gets easier with time. Remember to be patient with yourself and to celebrate your progress, no matter how small it may seem.\n\nAnother behavior that could be helpful is to engage in activities that align with your new core belief. For example, you could challenge yourself to try something new this week, like joining a study group or attending a community event. This can help you build confidence and reinforce the belief that you're capable of growth and change.\n\nWhat do you think about adding an activity like that to your homework?\n\nPatient: Joining a study group or attending a community event feels a little scary, but I can see how it would help me build confidence. I'll think about it and try to come up with an activity that feels manageable.\n\nTherapist: That's a great approach, Maria. It's okay to start small and work your way up to bigger challenges. The important thing is that you're taking steps to engage in activities that align with your new core belief.\n\nTo summarize your homework for this week:\n1. Create a list of your accomplishments, both big and small, and refer to it when you're feeling down.\n2. Practice self-compassion by catching negative self-talk and asking yourself what you would say to a friend in the same situation.\n3. Engage in an activity that aligns with your new core belief, such as joining a study group or attending a community event.\n\nDoes this feel manageable for you?",
