  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Maria, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me so far. Today, I'm feeling a bit low, to be honest. I've been struggling with negative thoughts about my academic performance and my relationship with my children.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Maria. It's important that we discuss these challenges you're facing. Let's start by setting an agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to explore the negative thoughts you've been experiencing and how they're impacting your mood. We can also discuss your relationship with your children and strategies for improving communication. What do you think about including these topics in our agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I also wanted to talk about the homework you assigned in the last session. I tried to practice the Positive Data Log and cognitive restructuring techniques, but I found it challenging at times.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, let's include a review of your homework experience in our agenda. We can discuss what worked well for you and what you found challenging. This will help us tailor the techniques to better suit your needs. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main points I wanted to discuss.\n\nTherapist: Great, so our agenda for today's session includes:\n1. Exploring the negative thoughts you've been experiencing and their impact on your mood\n2. Discussing your relationship with your children and strategies for improving communication\n3. Reviewing your experience with the homework, focusing on the Positive Data Log and cognitive restructuring techniques\n\nLet's start by exploring the negative thoughts you mentioned. Can you tell me more about the thoughts you've been having regarding your academic performance?",
