  "transcript": "Therapist: It's understandable that your family relationships might be impacting your mental health, Maria. Our connections with loved ones can have a significant influence on our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Can you tell me more about your family dynamics and how you feel they might be affecting you?\n\nPatient: Well, as I mentioned before, my relationship with my children has been strained since the divorce. We don't talk often, and when we do, it feels superficial. I miss the closeness we used to have. And with my ex-husband, there's still a lot of unresolved hurt and anger. I find myself dwelling on the past and what could have been.\n\nTherapist: It's common for family conflicts and unresolved emotions to contribute to depression. The feelings of loss, hurt, and anger can be very powerful. Let's explore this further. When you find yourself dwelling on the past or feeling hurt by your family relationships, what thoughts tend to come up for you?\n\nPatient: I think things like, \"I failed as a mother\" or \"I ruined my family.\" I feel like I'm to blame for the distance between us, and I worry that it will never get better.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound very painful, Maria. And they're a good example of how our thoughts can influence our feelings and behaviors. When you have those thoughts, how does it make you feel, and what do you tend to do?\n\nPatient: I feel sad, guilty, and hopeless. I often end up isolating myself and avoiding reaching out to my children because I assume they don't want to hear from me anyway.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Maria. We can see how those negative thoughts about your family relationships lead to feelings of sadness, guilt, and hopelessness, which then contribute to behaviors like isolating yourself and avoiding contact. This is a cycle that can maintain depression over time. In CBT, we work on breaking that cycle by examining and challenging those negative thoughts and finding more balanced, adaptive ways of thinking. Let's try that now. When you have the thought, \"I failed as a mother,\" what evidence do you have that supports or refutes that thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the evidence that supports it is that my children don't talk to me much, and our relationship is strained. But when I think about it, there's also evidence that refutes it. I know that I always tried my best to be a good mother. I was there for them when they needed me, and I provided for them as best I could. It's just hard to remember that sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of looking at the evidence for and against a negative thought, Maria. And you're right \u2013 it can be hard to remember the positive evidence when we're feeling down. That's why it's so important to practice this skill of examining our thoughts and finding more balanced perspectives. Another helpful question to ask yourself is, \"Is this thought helpful, or is it getting in my way?\" How might you answer that question for the thought \"I failed as a mother\"?\n\nPatient: I guess that thought isn't very helpful. It just makes me feel worse and keeps me stuck in negative patterns. A more helpful thought might be, \"I made mistakes, but I also did a lot of things right as a mother. I can focus on repairing my relationships now, rather than dwelling on the past.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful reframe, Maria! Focusing on what you can do now, rather than getting stuck in the past, is a much more helpful and empowering perspective. And it opens up possibilities for taking action to improve your relationships, like reaching out to your children or expressing your feelings to them in a letter. These are the kinds of thoughts and behaviors that can help break the cycle of depression.",
