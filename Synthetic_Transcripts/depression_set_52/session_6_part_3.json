  "transcript": "Patient: Problem-solving sounds like a useful technique. I often feel stuck when it comes to my financial situation and family relationships, so having a structured way to approach these challenges could be helpful.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find the problem-solving technique relevant to your situation. Let's walk through the steps together, using your financial stress as an example.\n\nThe first step is to identify the problem. In this case, the problem seems to be the financial stress you're experiencing due to your current situation. Is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's the main problem I'm facing right now.\n\nTherapist: Okay, now let's move on to brainstorming potential solutions. This is where you'll want to think of as many possible solutions as you can, without judging their feasibility at this point. Some potential solutions could be finding a part-time job, cutting back on expenses, seeking financial assistance, or even exploring new career options. What are some other solutions you can think of?\n\nPatient: I could also look into selling some of my belongings that I no longer need, like clothes or books. Another option could be to reach out to my children and see if they can provide some temporary financial support.\n\nTherapist: Those are great additional solutions. The next step is to evaluate the pros and cons of each potential solution. For example, finding a part-time job could provide additional income, but it might also take time away from your studies and self-care. Cutting back on expenses could help you save money, but it might also require sacrificing some of the activities you enjoy. What are some pros and cons you can think of for the other solutions you mentioned?\n\nPatient: Selling my belongings could bring in some extra cash, but it might also be time-consuming and emotionally difficult to part with items that have sentimental value. Asking my children for help could provide temporary relief, but it might also strain our already complicated relationships.\n\nTherapist: You've identified some important pros and cons for each solution. The next step is to select the best option based on your evaluation. Consider which solution seems most feasible and likely to have a positive impact on your financial stress. Keep in mind that you can always revisit other solutions if needed.\n\nPatient: I think the best option for me right now would be to focus on cutting back on expenses and finding a part-time job. While it might be challenging, I believe these solutions have the potential to provide the most significant and sustainable impact on my financial situation.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a well-thought-out decision. The final step is to create a plan for implementing your chosen solution. This plan should include specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. For example, you could set a goal to create a budget within the next week, identifying areas where you can cut back on expenses. You could also set a goal to apply to at least three part-time jobs within the next two weeks. What specific goals can you set for yourself as part of your plan?\n\nPatient: I can set a goal to create a budget by the end of this week, outlining how much I need to cut back in each expense category. I can also set a goal to research and apply to at least five part-time jobs within the next three weeks, focusing on positions that can work around my class schedule.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent SMART goals. Remember to break down your goals into smaller, manageable steps and track your progress along the way. As you implement your plan, be sure to monitor your mood and adjust your goals as needed.\n\nNow that we've walked through the problem-solving process, how do you feel about applying this technique to your financial stress and other challenges you're facing?\n\nPatient: I feel more empowered and hopeful knowing that I have a structured approach to tackling my problems. It's reassuring to break things down into smaller steps and have a plan to follow.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the problem-solving technique resonates with you. Remember, problem-solving is a skill that takes practice. Don't be discouraged if you encounter setbacks or if some solutions don't work out as planned. The key is to remain flexible and persistent in your efforts.\n\nAs we continue to work together, we can apply this technique to other challenges you're facing, such as navigating difficult family relationships. Speaking of which, how have you been feeling about your family situation since our last session?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to apply some of the cognitive restructuring techniques we've discussed to my thoughts about my family. It's been helpful to recognize when I'm engaging in all-or-nothing thinking or jumping to conclusions. However, I still struggle with feelings of guilt and shame related to my divorce and its impact on my children.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that you're still experiencing those feelings, even as you work on challenging your negative thoughts. Divorce and family estrangement can be complex and emotionally charged issues that take time to process.\n\nOne technique that can be helpful in addressing feelings of guilt and shame is self-compassion. Self-compassion involves treating yourself with the same kindness, concern, and support you would offer to a good friend facing a similar situation. This can include acknowledging your own pain, recognizing that everyone makes mistakes, and offering yourself understanding and forgiveness.\n\nHow do you feel about incorporating some self-compassion practices into our work together?",
