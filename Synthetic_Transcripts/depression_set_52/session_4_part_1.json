  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Maria, it's great to see you again for our fourth session. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your support. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the thought recording technique and engage in stress-reducing activities. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on the techniques we discussed and that you've noticed some improvements, even if they're small. Can you tell me more about your experience with the thought recording and stress-reducing activities?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to identify and challenge at least one negative thought per day. It's not always easy, but I've found that taking a step back and looking at the evidence helps me see things more clearly. As for stress-reducing activities, I attended my weekly choir practice, which always lifts my spirits. I also tried writing in my journal a couple of times, focusing on my emotions related to my divorce and family estrangement.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been consistent with the thought recording and have found choir practice to be a helpful stress-reducing activity. Journaling about your emotions related to your divorce and family estrangement is also a significant step. How did it feel to write about those experiences?\n\nPatient: It was difficult at first. I've been avoiding those feelings for so long, but putting them down on paper made them feel more real. It was emotional, but I also felt a sense of relief afterward, like I was acknowledging my pain instead of pushing it away.\n\nTherapist: Acknowledging and processing those difficult emotions is an important part of healing. It takes courage to face them, and I'm proud of you for taking that step. Now, let's set an agenda for today's session. We can review your experiences with the thought recording and stress-reducing activities in more detail, continue exploring the impact of family dynamics on your mental health, and introduce some additional CBT techniques to help you progress towards your therapy goals. What would you like to prioritize in our session today?",
