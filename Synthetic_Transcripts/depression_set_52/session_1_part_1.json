  "transcript": "Patient: Hello, my name is Maria Hernandez. I'm here for my first therapy session.\n\nTherapist: Welcome, Maria. It's nice to meet you. My name is Nova, and I'll be your AI therapist for today's session. Before we begin, I want to explain that this is an assessment phase, where we'll gather information about your current situation and reasons for seeking therapy. It's important for you to know that as an AI, I have some limitations. I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information or hallucinate. I also want to clarify that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I won't be able to observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for your understanding, Maria. Let's start by discussing what brought you to therapy. Can you tell me a little bit about your current life situation and the challenges you're facing?\n\nPatient: Well, I recently lost my part-time job at a bookstore, and I'm struggling to make ends meet while pursuing my PhD in Education. I feel overwhelmed and isolated, and my depression seems to be getting worse.\n\nTherapist: I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time, Maria. Losing a job and dealing with financial stress can be incredibly challenging, especially while pursuing a demanding academic goal. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed, isolated, and that your depression is worsening. Can you tell me more about how your depression has been affecting you lately?\n\nPatient: I've been feeling sad and worthless most of the time. I struggle to concentrate on my studies, and I have trouble sleeping at night. I don't have the energy to do the things I used to enjoy, like singing in the choir or playing volleyball.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like your depression is really taking a toll on your daily life and the activities that once brought you joy. I want to assure you that you're not alone in this struggle, and we'll work together to help you find ways to cope with these challenges. In our sessions, we'll explore your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and develop strategies to help you manage your depression and improve your overall well-being. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: It sounds good. I'm willing to try anything that might help me feel better.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude to have, Maria. Your willingness to engage in therapy and work towards positive change is a significant strength. Before we continue, I want to check in with you. How are you feeling about our session so far?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit nervous, but also hopeful that this might help me.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel nervous during your first therapy session. I'm here to support you, and we'll work at a pace that feels comfortable for you. Remember, therapy is a collaborative process, and your input and feedback are essential. If at any point you feel uncomfortable or have concerns, please don't hesitate to let me know. Now, let's create an agenda for today's session. We'll start by discussing your current challenges and gathering more information about your background and experiences. We'll also explore your goals for therapy and what you hope to achieve through our work together. How does that plan sound to you?",
