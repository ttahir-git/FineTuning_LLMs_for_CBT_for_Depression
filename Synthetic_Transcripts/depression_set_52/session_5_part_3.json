  "transcript": "Patient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful after our discussion about managing financial stress. It's reassuring to know that there are techniques I can use to cope with these overwhelming emotions.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Maria. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. As we continue to work together, we'll explore more strategies to help you manage your emotions and build resilience.\n\nEarlier, you mentioned that you wanted to discuss your family relationships, particularly with your children. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind regarding this topic?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been thinking a lot about my relationship with my children and how it's been affected by my depression. I feel like I haven't been the best mother to them, especially during my divorce. I worry that I've pushed them away and that they don't want to have a relationship with me anymore.\n\nTherapist: It's common for depression to strain family relationships, Maria. When we're struggling with our own mental health, it can be challenging to maintain the same level of connection and support with our loved ones. However, it's important to remember that your depression does not define you as a mother or a person.\n\nLet's explore some of the thoughts and beliefs you have about your relationship with your children. Can you identify any specific thoughts that come up when you think about your role as their mother?\n\nPatient: One thought that keeps coming up is that I've failed them. I feel like I wasn't there for them emotionally when they needed me, especially during the divorce. I worry that they see me as weak or unreliable because of my depression.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Maria. It takes courage to acknowledge these difficult thoughts and feelings. Let's take a closer look at the thought \"I've failed them.\" This seems to be a core belief that's contributing to your emotional distress.\n\nIn CBT, we often talk about cognitive distortions, which are inaccurate or irrational thought patterns that can contribute to negative emotions. One common distortion is \"all-or-nothing thinking,\" where we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms. It seems like the thought \"I've failed them\" might be an example of this distortion.\n\nCan you think of any evidence that contradicts this thought? Are there times when you have been there for your children, even in small ways?\n\nPatient: When you put it that way, I can see how that thought might be a bit extreme. There have been times when I've been there for my children, like when my daughter was going through a tough breakup and I stayed up all night talking with her. And even though my son doesn't reach out as often, he did call me on my birthday, which shows that he still cares.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Maria. You've identified some important evidence that contradicts the thought \"I've failed them.\" It's essential to recognize and acknowledge these moments of connection and support, even if they feel small in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAnother cognitive distortion that might be at play here is \"disqualifying the positive,\" where we dismiss or minimize positive experiences or qualities. It seems like you might be focusing more on the times when you felt you weren't there for your children, rather than the times when you were.\n\nAs we continue to work together, we'll practice identifying and challenging these cognitive distortions. The goal is to develop a more balanced and accurate view of yourself and your relationships.\n\nHow do you feel about what we've discussed so far regarding your thoughts about being a mother?\n\nPatient: It's eye-opening to see how my thoughts might be distorted. I guess I have been focusing more on the negative aspects of our relationship, rather than the positive ones. It's going to take some practice to change these thought patterns, but I'm willing to try.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Maria. Recognizing these thought patterns is an important first step in the process of change. As we continue to work together, we'll practice reframing these thoughts in a more balanced and compassionate way.\n\nRemember, changing long-standing thought patterns takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\nBefore we move on, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling now. Has our discussion about your relationship with your children brought up any new emotions or concerns for you?",
