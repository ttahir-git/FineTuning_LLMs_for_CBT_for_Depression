  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Maria, it's great to see you again for our ninth session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information or lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. In case of a crisis or emergency, I'm not equipped to provide immediate intervention, and I strongly encourage you to seek appropriate help from local resources or professionals.\n\nWith that said, I appreciate you sharing the summary of our last session. It helps us maintain continuity and build upon the progress we've made so far. How have you been since our last meeting? I'm interested in hearing about your experiences, mood, and any changes you've noticed.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the sleep hygiene strategies we discussed. I've noticed some improvement in my sleep quality, although it's still a challenge at times. I've also been continuing with the self-compassionate journaling, but I find it difficult to reframe my self-critical thoughts consistently.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on the sleep hygiene strategies and noticing some improvement in your sleep quality. Change takes time, and it's normal to face challenges along the way. Regarding the self-compassionate journaling, reframing self-critical thoughts can be a difficult process, especially when these thoughts have been deeply ingrained over time. Let's explore this further during our session today.\n\nFor our agenda, I suggest we prioritize discussing your experience with the homework, particularly the self-compassionate journaling and sleep hygiene strategies. We can also continue exploring the impact of family dynamics on your mental health, as we had planned in our last session. Additionally, we can introduce some new CBT techniques that may help you with reframing your thoughts and managing your emotions. What are your thoughts on this agenda? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
