  "transcript": "Patient: Practicing the downward arrow technique was eye-opening. I realized that many of my negative thoughts about myself as a student and a mother stem from a deeper belief that I'm not good enough. It's like I have this constant fear of failing or disappointing others.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant insight, Maria. Identifying these underlying core beliefs is a crucial step in understanding and addressing the thoughts and feelings that contribute to your depression. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a situation where you noticed this core belief of not being good enough?\n\nPatient: Well, when I got that lower grade on my assignment, my first thought was, \"I'm not smart enough to be in this program.\" Then, using the downward arrow technique, I realized that I believe if I'm not perfect in my studies, it means I'm a failure overall.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. It's common for people to have these kinds of all-or-nothing thoughts, where anything less than perfection feels like a total failure. This is a cognitive distortion called \"all-or-nothing thinking\" or \"black-and-white thinking.\" The problem with this type of thinking is that it doesn't leave room for the gray areas of life, where most experiences and situations fall.\n\nPatient: I can see how that type of thinking has been affecting me. It's like I don't give myself any credit for the progress I've made or the effort I put in.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. One way to start challenging this all-or-nothing thinking is to look for evidence that contradicts it. For example, have there been times in your academic journey where you've faced challenges but still managed to succeed or learn from the experience?\n\nPatient: Now that I think about it, there have been moments like that. Last semester, I struggled with a particular course but managed to pass it by seeking help from my professor and putting in extra effort. It wasn't a perfect grade, but I still made it through.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of evidence against the all-or-nothing thought that anything less than perfection is a failure. You demonstrated resilience and problem-solving skills, which are valuable strengths. Let's continue to gather evidence like this to challenge the core belief that you're not good enough.",
