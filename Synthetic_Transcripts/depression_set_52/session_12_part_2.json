  "transcript": "Therapist: Before we dive into cognitive restructuring, let's explore your experience with the Core Belief Worksheet a bit more. You mentioned that it's been challenging to find evidence against your core belief of not being good enough. Can you share an example of a situation where you struggled to identify evidence against this belief?\n\nPatient: Well, last week I received a lower grade than I expected on a paper I wrote for one of my classes. I worked really hard on it, but the professor said I didn't fully address the main question. I immediately started thinking that I'm not cut out for this PhD program and that I'm not smart enough to succeed.\n\nTherapist: That must have been really difficult, especially after putting in so much effort. Let's break down this situation using the thought record. First, can you identify the emotions you experienced when you received the feedback and their intensity on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt really disappointed and frustrated, maybe around 80. I also felt ashamed, like a 70, because I thought I should have done better.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so disappointment at 80 and shame at 70. Now, what was the most prominent automatic thought that came to your mind when you received the feedback?\n\nPatient: My first thought was, \"I'm not good enough for this program. I'll never be able to get my PhD.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a strong thought, and it seems to be closely tied to your core belief of not being good enough. Let's look at the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not good enough for the program?\n\nPatient: Well, the fact that I didn't do well on this paper, even though I worked hard on it. And sometimes I struggle to keep up with the readings and assignments.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against this thought? Have there been times when you've succeeded in your classes or received positive feedback?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been a few times when I got good grades on assignments. And one of my professors said I made a valuable contribution to a class discussion last month.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're not good enough. It shows that you are capable of succeeding in the program, even if there are challenges along the way. Now, let's try to reframe this thought in a more balanced way. What's an alternative thought that takes into account both the evidence for and against the original thought?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I may struggle at times, but I am capable of succeeding in this program. One setback doesn't define my entire worth or ability.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and compassionate way to view the situation. How do you think this alternative thought would impact your emotions if you were to fully believe it?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel less disappointed and ashamed. Maybe more like a 40 or 50 instead of 70 or 80.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in your emotional response. It shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing our feelings. By challenging negative thoughts and reframing them in a more balanced way, we can start to shift our emotional experience.\n\nNow, let's talk a bit more about cognitive restructuring. This technique involves identifying negative automatic thoughts, examining the evidence for and against them, and generating alternative thoughts that are more balanced and based on evidence. It's a way of challenging the negative thoughts that contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety.\n\nFor example, if you have the thought, \"I'm a failure as a mother because my children don't visit me often,\" we could examine the evidence for and against this thought. Evidence against it might include the fact that your children are adults with their own lives and responsibilities, and their level of contact may not be a direct reflection of your worth as a mother. An alternative thought could be, \"I did my best as a mother, and my children's choices are their own. My worth is not solely defined by my relationship with them.\"\n\nDoes this make sense, Maria? Can you think of other situations where cognitive restructuring might be helpful?",
