  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Maria, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times, and I want you to feel comfortable correcting me if that happens. It's also important to note that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Lastly, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so I'll be relying on your openness and honesty in sharing your thoughts and feelings with me. With that said, how have you been since our last session? How has your mood been, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your honesty. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice self-compassion and celebrate small victories, as we discussed. It hasn't been easy, and I still find myself falling into old patterns of self-criticism and perfectionism at times. My mood has been up and down \u2013 some days I feel more hopeful and motivated, while other days I struggle with feelings of sadness and worthlessness. One positive change is that I've been making an effort to reach out to my neighbors more often, and I've found that socializing and sharing a meal with them lifts my spirits, even if it's just for a short while. I'm still worried about my finances and the pressure of my studies, but I'm trying to take things one day at a time.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been making an effort to practice self-compassion and celebrate small victories, even though it's been challenging at times. It's completely normal to have ups and downs, and the fact that you're noticing these patterns is a sign of progress. I'm also glad to hear that you've been reaching out to your neighbors more often and finding comfort in socializing and sharing meals with them. Maintaining social connections and engaging in activities that bring you joy, even in small doses, can be incredibly helpful in managing depression. Regarding your concerns about finances and academic pressure, we can definitely explore those further in today's session. Speaking of which, let's take a moment to set an agenda for our time together. What would you like to prioritize today? We could discuss your experiences with the homework, explore your financial concerns and problem-solving strategies, or delve into the impact of family dynamics on your mental health. What feels most important to you right now?",
