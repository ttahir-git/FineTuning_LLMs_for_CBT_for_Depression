  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Maria, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to apply the cognitive restructuring techniques we discussed. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood. I still struggle with negative thoughts about my academic performance and family relationships, but I'm trying to be more aware of them and challenge them when they arise.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been applying the cognitive restructuring techniques and noticing some improvements in your mood, even if they're small. Recognizing and challenging negative thoughts is a crucial step in the process. What specific thoughts have you been working on, and how have you been challenging them?\n\nPatient: One recurring thought is that I'm not good enough in my academic pursuits. When I catch myself thinking this way, I try to look for evidence that contradicts this belief, like the positive feedback I've received from my professors. It's not always easy, but I'm trying to be more balanced in my thinking.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example of how you've been applying cognitive restructuring. Challenging the thought that you're not good enough by looking for contradictory evidence is a powerful way to start shifting your perspective. Remember, it's a process, and it takes time and practice to build new habits of thinking. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to continue working on my negative thoughts related to academics and family. I also want to discuss how I can better manage my stress and practice self-care, as I've been neglecting that lately.\n\nTherapist: Those are important topics to focus on. Let's start with your negative thoughts related to academics and family, and then move on to discussing stress management and self-care. We'll also review your homework from the last session and see how we can build upon that. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to dive in.",
