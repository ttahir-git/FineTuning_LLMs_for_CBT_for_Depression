  "transcript": "Patient: I think our current communication patterns are inconsistent. We don't have a regular schedule for talking, and sometimes weeks go by without any contact. I'd like to see us have more frequent and meaningful conversations, where we share more about our lives and feelings.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Maria. Consistent and meaningful communication is important for building and maintaining strong relationships. Let's explore some strategies you can use to work towards this goal.\n\nOne strategy is to set a regular schedule for phone or video calls, as we discussed in our previous session. Having a predictable time to talk can help create a sense of routine and reliability in your relationship. How did you feel about the idea of setting up a regular call when we discussed it last time?\n\nPatient: I felt a bit nervous about it, to be honest. I was worried that my children might not want to commit to a regular call or that they would feel like I was imposing on their time. But I also felt hopeful that it could help us stay more connected.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel nervous about proposing a change in your communication pattern, Maria. It's common to have worries about how others might react. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought that your children might not want to commit to a regular call.\n\nWhat evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, as I mentioned before, they don't always seem enthusiastic about talking to me, and sometimes they're slow to respond to my messages or calls.\n\nTherapist: Okay, those are valid observations. Now, what evidence do you have that goes against this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess the fact that they did agree to have a regular call with me last time is evidence that they're willing to make an effort. And even though they don't always initiate contact, they do usually respond eventually and seem to enjoy our conversations once we're talking.\n\nTherapist: Great, so there is evidence on both sides of this thought. It seems that while your children may not always initiate contact, they are willing to engage when you reach out, and they have agreed to a regular call in the past. Based on this evidence, how could you reframe your original thought?\n\nPatient: I could reframe it as \"Even though my children don't always initiate contact, they do seem to value our relationship and are willing to make an effort to stay connected, as shown by their agreement to have a regular call.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Maria. It acknowledges your children's willingness to engage, even if they don't always initiate. This reframe could help you feel more confident about proposing a regular call schedule.\n\nAnother strategy for improving communication is to practice active listening and expressing empathy during your conversations. This means focusing on understanding your children's perspectives and feelings, rather than just sharing your own. How do you feel about this strategy?\n\nPatient: I think it's a good idea. I know I sometimes get caught up in my own thoughts and feelings during our conversations, and I might not always listen as closely as I could. I'd like to work on being more present and empathetic when we talk.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Maria. Practicing active listening and empathy can help create a deeper sense of connection and understanding in your conversations. One way to do this is to paraphrase what your children say, to show that you're listening and to check your understanding. For example, you could say something like, \"It sounds like you're feeling really stressed about your work situation right now. Is that right?\"\n\nAnother strategy is to express validation for their feelings, even if you don't necessarily agree with their perspective. This could sound like, \"I can understand why you would feel that way, given the situation.\" How do you think these strategies might impact your conversations with your children?\n\nPatient: I think they could help my children feel more heard and understood, which might make them more open to sharing with me. And if I'm focusing more on their feelings and experiences, I might feel less anxious about my own role in the conversation.\n\nTherapist: Those are great points, Maria. Active listening and empathy can help create a safer and more supportive space for both you and your children to share your thoughts and feelings. It's a great goal to work towards in your relationship.\n\nAnother strategy we can discuss is using \"I\" statements to express your own feelings and needs in a non-blaming way. This means starting sentences with \"I feel...\" or \"I need...\" rather than \"You always...\" or \"You never...\" How familiar are you with this concept?\n\nPatient: I've heard of it before, but I don't think I use it very often in my conversations with my children. I can see how it might help avoid putting them on the defensive, though.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Maria. Using \"I\" statements can help you express your thoughts and feelings in a way that takes responsibility for your own experience, rather than placing blame on the other person. This can make it easier for the other person to hear and understand your perspective.\n\nFor example, instead of saying, \"You never call me,\" you could say, \"I feel sad when we don't talk for long periods of time.\" Or instead of saying, \"You don't care about our relationship,\" you could say, \"I need to feel more connected to you in our relationship.\"\n\nHow do you think using \"I\" statements might impact your communication with your children?\n\nPatient: I think it could help them feel less attacked or criticized, which might make them more open to hearing my perspective. And it might help me feel more empowered to express my needs, rather than just feeling resentful or hopeless.\n\nTherapist: Those are great insights, Maria. Using \"I\" statements can be a powerful tool for improving communication and building stronger relationships. It's a skill that takes practice, but it can make a big difference in how your messages are received.\n\nWould you be willing to practice using \"I\" statements in our session today, perhaps in role-playing a conversation with one of your children?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that could be helpful. I'm a bit nervous about it, but I'm willing to try.",
