  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Maria, it's great to see you again for our seventh session. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last session. It's essential for us to review what we discussed and ensure we're on the same page. Before we dive into today's agenda, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today, and have there been any significant changes since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the problem-solving plan we discussed regarding my financial stress. I created a budget and started applying for part-time jobs, but I haven't heard back from any of them yet. It's a bit discouraging, but I'm trying to stay hopeful. I've also been practicing the deep breathing exercises, which have been helpful in managing my stress levels. However, I've been struggling with the self-compassionate journaling. It's challenging to be kind to myself when I feel like I've failed as a mother.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been taking steps to address your financial stress and that the deep breathing exercises have been helpful. It's understandable to feel discouraged when you haven't received responses from job applications, but it's great that you're trying to maintain hope. Regarding the self-compassionate journaling, it's common to struggle with being kind to ourselves, especially when we hold deep-seated beliefs about our perceived failures. Let's explore this further today. For our agenda, I suggest we:\n\n1. Review your experience with the homework, particularly the self-compassionate journaling and problem-solving related to financial stress.\n2. Continue exploring the impact of family dynamics on your mental health.\n3. Introduce additional self-compassion practices to help you develop a more compassionate inner dialogue.\n4. Discuss any other concerns or challenges you'd like to address.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?\n\nPatient: The agenda sounds good to me. I think it covers the main areas I've been struggling with. I would also like to discuss how I can better manage my feelings of guilt and shame related to my divorce and its impact on my children. It's something that weighs heavily on me, and I'm not sure how to move forward.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss strategies for managing feelings of guilt and shame related to your divorce and its impact on your children. It's a significant concern, and I'm glad you brought it up. Let's start by reviewing your experience with the self-compassionate journaling homework. Can you tell me more about the challenges you faced while trying to write the journal entry?",
