  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Maria, it's great to see you again for our 10th session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to acknowledge that as your AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or significant experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the downward arrow and thought records. It's been challenging at times, but I think I'm starting to see some progress in how I respond to negative thoughts. However, I've also had some difficult moments, especially when I received a lower grade than expected on a recent assignment. It triggered feelings of self-doubt and thoughts like \"I'm not capable of succeeding in this program.\"\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some progress. It's also important to acknowledge the challenges you've faced, particularly with the recent assignment. Let's explore that further. When you received the lower grade, what emotions did you experience, and how intense were they?\n\nPatient: I felt really disappointed and frustrated with myself. On a scale of 0 to 10, I'd say the intensity was around an 8. I started thinking that maybe I'm not cut out for this PhD program and that I'm just wasting my time and money.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Maria. Those thoughts and feelings of self-doubt can be overwhelming. Let's add this experience to our agenda for today, along with reviewing your homework and discussing any other concerns you may have. Does that sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I'd also like to talk more about how my negative thoughts about myself as a mother and a student are connected. I feel like they're both contributing to my depression.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can explore that connection further. It's important to understand how our thoughts in different areas of life can influence our overall well-being. Let's start by reviewing your homework. How did you find practicing the downward arrow technique on your own?",
