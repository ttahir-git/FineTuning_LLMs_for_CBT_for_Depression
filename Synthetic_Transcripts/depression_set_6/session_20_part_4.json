As we wrap up our session today, I want to emphasize how much progress you've made in developing your CBT skills and applying them to your life. You've demonstrated a strong understanding of the concepts we've discussed and a commitment to putting them into practice.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel like I've learned a lot, but I also know that I still have work to do.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's a healthy perspective to have. Therapy is an ongoing process, and you've laid a strong foundation for continued growth. Before we end today, let's take a moment to review your homework for the coming week.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'm ready.\n\nTherapist: Great. First, I'd like you to continue practicing the deep breathing exercise we did today. Aim to practice for a few minutes each day, even when you're not feeling particularly stressed. This will help build the habit and make it easier to use when you need it most.\n\nPatient: Got it. I'll try to practice deep breathing every day.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. Next, I'd like you to create a mood management plan that includes activities and techniques you can use to cope with difficult emotions. Include things like going for a walk, listening to music, writing, and any other activities that help you feel better. Having a plan in place can help you take action even when your motivation is low.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I'll work on creating a mood management plan.\n\nTherapist: Finally, I'd like you to continue using thought records to challenge negative thoughts related to your job search and self-worth. Remember to look for evidence that supports or refutes your thoughts, and try to develop more balanced and adaptive thoughts based on that evidence.\n\nPatient: I'll keep working on the thought records. They've been really helpful for me.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. Remember, the more you practice these skills, the more automatic they'll become. If you have any questions or concerns as you work on your homework, don't hesitate to bring them up in our next session.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you for your support and guidance, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Emilio. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Before we end, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling okay. A little tired, but also hopeful and motivated to keep working on my goals.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Remember to take care of yourself and celebrate the progress you've made. If you find yourself struggling this week, don't hesitate to reach out for support.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you again, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Emilio. I look forward to our next session. Take care.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed progress with thought records and self-compassion\n  - Discussed job search challenges and strategies for staying motivated\n  - Explored bedtime routine and additional sleep techniques\n  - Introduced thought defusion and guided meditation/progressive muscle relaxation\n  - Reviewed plan for final session and discussed feelings about ending therapy\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Continued practicing identifying and challenging negative thoughts related to job search and sleep difficulties\n  - Self-compassion: Reviewed progress and challenges with practicing self-compassion\n  - Goal-setting: Discussed setting smaller, achievable goals for job search\n  - Sleep hygiene: Reviewed progress with bedtime routine and introduced additional techniques for managing racing thoughts and worries\n  - Thought defusion: Introduced concept and provided examples of observing thoughts without engaging with them\n  - Guided meditation/progressive muscle relaxation: Suggested as potential sleep techniques to try\n  - Deep breathing: Practiced deep breathing exercise during session and discussed benefits for managing stress and anxiety\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Complete 3-4 thought records, focusing on situations where negative thoughts come up related to job search or sleep difficulties\n  - Set aside time each evening to review thoughts and emotions from the day and complete a thought record if needed\n  - Set 2-3 smaller goals for the week related to job search, such as researching companies or tailoring application materials\n  - Experiment with sleep techniques, including thought defusion, guided meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation\n  - Practice deep breathing exercise for a few minutes each day\n  - Create a mood management plan that includes activities and techniques to cope with difficult emotions\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details:\n  - Demonstrated improved skill in identifying and challenging negative thoughts related to job search and sleep difficulties\n  - Expressed difficulty with practicing self-compassion and managing racing thoughts before bed, but open to trying new techniques\n  - Depression symptoms remain present, but patient reported feeling more hopeful after session\n  - Patient is a 24-year-old non-binary individual of Hispanic descent, currently unemployed and living alone in a new city\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Identified core belief: \"I'm not good enough, there's something fundamentally wrong with me\"\n  - Identified intermediate belief: \"If I don't find a job soon, I'll never be successful or happy\"\n  - Identified belief related to self-compassion: \"I don't deserve compassion or understanding if I'm not perfect\"\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue monitoring patient's progress with thought records, self-compassion practice, and sleep hygiene\n  - Address patient's job search struggles and their impact on mental health\n  - Monitor patient's depression symptoms and adjust treatment plan as necessary\n  - Follow up on patient's progress with challenging negative core beliefs and building self-compassion\n  - Explore patient's experience with implementing a consistent bedtime routine and its impact on sleep quality\n  - Discuss patient's experience with practicing deep breathing and creating a mood management plan\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review homework and discuss any challenges or insights\n  - Continue practicing thought records and self-compassion\n  - Explore patient's progress with implementing a consistent bedtime routine and its impact on sleep quality\n  - Assess patient's depression symptoms and provide support and validation\n  - Discuss progress and challenges related to job search, self-care, and social connection\n  - Review overall progress in therapy and create a relapse prevention plan for maintaining gains after therapy ends",
