  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 18. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like the thought records and self-compassion break. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some improvements in my mood and overall outlook. I'm still struggling with sleep and finding a consistent routine, but I'm working on it.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed, and I'm glad to know that you've noticed some improvements in your mood. The challenges you mentioned with sleep and routine are important to address. Let's make sure to include them in our agenda for today. Speaking of which, what would you like to focus on in our session today? We can review your progress with the homework, discuss any challenges or insights, and explore how we can continue to support your well-being.\n\nPatient: I think it would be helpful to review my thought records and get your feedback on how I've been applying the self-compassion break. I'm also interested in discussing strategies for improving my sleep hygiene and creating a more consistent routine. Additionally, I'd like to touch on my job search and how it's been affecting my mental health.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Emilio. We can start by reviewing your thought records and discussing your experience with the self-compassion break. Then, we can explore strategies for improving your sleep hygiene and creating a consistent routine. We'll also make sure to discuss your job search and its impact on your mental health. As we work through these topics, remember that our goal is to help you build the skills and resilience to navigate these challenges independently. Let's begin with reviewing your thought records. Can you share some examples of situations where you used them and how they helped you identify and challenge negative thoughts?",
