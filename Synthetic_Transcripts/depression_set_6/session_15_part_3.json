  "transcript": "Patient: You're right, setting small goals and having a plan for accountability makes sense. I think I'll start by going for a run in the mornings, right after I wake up. That way, I can get it done before I get too busy or distracted with other things.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Emilio. Starting your day with exercise can help set a positive tone for the rest of the day and provide a sense of accomplishment early on. To help with accountability, you might consider tracking your runs with a fitness app or sharing your goal with a friend or family member who can check in on your progress. What do you think about those ideas?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of using a fitness app to track my runs. I used to use one a while back, and it was helpful to see my progress over time. I'm not sure about sharing my goal with anyone else, though. I don't want to feel like I'm letting someone down if I miss a day or don't meet my goal.\n\nTherapist: I understand your concern, Emilio. Sharing goals with others can feel vulnerable, especially if we're worried about judgment or disappointment. Remember that the purpose of accountability is to provide support and encouragement, not to add pressure or stress. If sharing with a friend or family member feels too daunting right now, perhaps you could start by sharing your goal with me and updating me on your progress in our sessions. We can celebrate your successes and problem-solve any challenges that come up together. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds more manageable. I like the idea of having some accountability, but I'm not ready to share this with my friends or family yet. I appreciate you being willing to support me in this way.\n\nTherapist: I'm happy to support you in any way I can, Emilio. Remember that building new habits takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself as you work on incorporating exercise into your routine. There may be days when it feels harder to motivate yourself, and that's okay. The important thing is to keep trying and not get discouraged by temporary setbacks.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder. I know I tend to be hard on myself when I don't meet my own expectations, so I'll try to keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Emilio. Noticing and challenging those self-critical thoughts is an important part of the process. When you find yourself having thoughts like \"I should be doing more\" or \"I'm not good enough,\" try to pause and reframe them in a more balanced and compassionate way. What might be a more helpful thought in those moments?\n\nPatient: I guess a more helpful thought would be something like, \"I'm doing the best I can right now, and that's enough. Building new habits takes time, and I'm making progress, even if it's not perfect.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Emilio. Acknowledging your efforts and progress, while also recognizing that perfection isn't the goal, can help you maintain a more balanced and self-compassionate perspective. As you continue working on your exercise goal, try to practice noticing and reframing self-critical thoughts in the moment. You can even use the thought record we've been practicing to write them down and challenge them more formally.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely try that. I know the thought records have been helpful for me in the past, so it's good to have that tool to fall back on.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Emilio. The skills you've been learning and practicing in our sessions are meant to be used in your daily life, not just when we're meeting. The more you can integrate them into your routine and use them to challenge negative thoughts and beliefs, the more benefit you'll see over time.",
