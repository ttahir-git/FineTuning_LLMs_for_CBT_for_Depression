  "transcript": "Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I'm open to trying behavioral activation and continuing with the thought recording technique. I think having a plan and tracking my progress will help me stay accountable and see how my mood is affected by the activities I engage in.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're open to trying behavioral activation, Emilio. Let's start by reviewing your homework from the last session. How did you find the process of thought recording? Were there any challenges or insights that stood out to you?\n\nPatient: The thought recording was challenging at first, but I found it helpful to write down my thoughts and emotions. It made me realize how often I engage in negative self-talk and how it affects my mood. One challenge I faced was identifying evidence against my negative thoughts. It's like my mind automatically focuses on the negative aspects of a situation.\n\nTherapist: It's common to face challenges when learning a new skill, and I appreciate your honesty about the difficulties you encountered. Recognizing the prevalence of negative self-talk is an important insight. Our minds often have a negativity bias, which means we tend to focus more on the negative aspects of a situation than the positive ones. With practice, it becomes easier to identify evidence against our negative thoughts. Let's look at an example from your thought record. Can you share a situation where you found it challenging to identify evidence against a negative thought?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I received a rejection email from a job I applied to. My initial thought was, \"I'm never going to find a job. I'm a failure.\" I could easily list evidence for this thought, like the number of rejections I've received and the fact that I'm still unemployed. But when it came to finding evidence against the thought, I struggled.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing this example, Emilio. Receiving a job rejection can be a significant trigger for negative thoughts. Let's explore this together. While it's true that you've faced rejections and are currently unemployed, is it accurate to say that you'll never find a job? Have there been any instances in the past where you've been successful in your job search or received positive feedback on your skills and qualifications?\n\nPatient: When you put it that way, I guess it's not entirely accurate to say I'll never find a job. I have had some successful interviews in the past, and I did receive positive feedback on my resume from a career counselor. It's just hard to focus on those things when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Emilio. When we're feeling down, it can be challenging to see the bigger picture and remember our past successes. That's why it's so important to practice identifying evidence against our negative thoughts. It helps us develop a more balanced and realistic perspective. Another thing to consider is that thoughts are not facts. Just because we think something doesn't necessarily mean it's true. Can you think of a more balanced thought to replace the initial negative thought about being a failure?\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought would be, \"Rejection is a normal part of the job search process. It doesn't mean I'm a failure. I have skills and qualifications that make me a strong candidate, and I will continue to pursue opportunities until I find the right fit.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic reframe, Emilio! You've acknowledged that rejection is a normal part of the process and separated your self-worth from the outcome. You've also recognized your skills and qualifications and maintained a sense of hope and perseverance. This is a great example of how thought recording can help us challenge negative thoughts and develop a more balanced perspective. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to identify and reframe negative thoughts in the moment.",
