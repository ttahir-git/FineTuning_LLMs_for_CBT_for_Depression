  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share an example from my thought record. A few days ago, I received another rejection email for a job I had applied to. I immediately felt really down and hopeless, like I'll never find a job in my field.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Emilio. Let's break down this situation using the thought record. What emotions did you experience when you received the rejection email, and how intense were they on a scale of 0 to 100?\n\nPatient: I felt really sad, probably around 80 out of 100. I also felt hopeless and worthless, both around 90.\n\nTherapist: Those are strong emotions, and it's understandable why you felt that way. What automatic thoughts went through your mind when you received the rejection?\n\nPatient: My first thought was, \"I'll never find a job.\" Then I started thinking, \"I'm not good enough,\" and \"I'm a failure.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are common negative thoughts that people experience when facing rejection. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'll never find a job.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been applying to jobs for months now and haven't had any success. I've had multiple rejections and no offers. It feels like I'm not making any progress.\n\nTherapist: I can see why those experiences would lead you to believe that you'll never find a job. Now, let's consider the evidence against this thought. What are some reasons why this thought might not be entirely accurate?\n\nPatient: I guess I haven't applied to every single job out there. There are still opportunities I haven't explored yet. And I do have my education and qualifications, even if they haven't led to a job yet.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. Even though it feels like you've been applying everywhere, there are still many possibilities out there. Your education and qualifications are also important evidence against the thought that you'll never find a job. Let's look at the other negative thoughts you mentioned: \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'm a failure.\" What evidence do you have for and against these thoughts?\n\nPatient: The evidence for these thoughts is similar to the first one. The rejections make me feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm failing at finding a job. But the evidence against these thoughts could be that I did well in my studies and I have skills and strengths that could be valuable to an employer.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's important to recognize that rejection is a normal part of the job search process and doesn't necessarily mean that you're not good enough or a failure. Your academic success and personal strengths are evidence against these negative thoughts. Now, let's try to come up with an alternative thought that takes into account both the evidence for and against your initial negative thoughts.\n\nPatient: I suppose an alternative thought could be, \"Rejection is difficult, but it doesn't mean I'll never find a job or that I'm a failure. I have valuable skills and qualifications that could lead to opportunities in the future.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges the difficulty of the situation while also recognizing your strengths and the possibility of future success. How do you feel when you consider this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: When I think about it that way, I do feel a bit less hopeless and worthless. The sadness is still there, but maybe more like 60 out of 100 instead of 80.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in intensity for your emotions. It shows that challenging negative thoughts and considering alternative perspectives can have a real impact on how you feel. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the more natural it will become.",
