  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your homework from the previous session. Can you share with me how you found the process of completing the thought records and engaging in planned activities?\n\nPatient: I managed to complete a few thought records, but I found it challenging to identify and challenge my negative thoughts, especially when I was feeling really down. As for the planned activities, I went for a walk a couple of times and cooked a nice meal for myself, but I didn't notice a significant change in my mood.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Emilio. It's common to face challenges when starting to use these techniques. Let's take a closer look at one of the thought records you completed. Can you walk me through an example?\n\nPatient: Sure. One day, I received another job rejection email, and it sent me into a spiral of negative thoughts. I wrote down the situation, my emotions, and the thoughts I was having, like \"I'm never going to find a job\" and \"I'm a failure.\" But when I tried to find evidence against these thoughts, I struggled to come up with anything convincing.\n\nTherapist: That's a great start, Emilio. Challenging negative thoughts can be difficult, especially when we're feeling overwhelmed by strong emotions. In situations like this, it can be helpful to break down the thoughts into smaller, more specific parts. For example, instead of focusing on the thought \"I'm never going to find a job,\" we could look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm making progress in my job search, even if it's not happening as quickly as I'd like.\" Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think so. It's just hard to see the progress when I keep getting rejected.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it can be discouraging, but let's look at the evidence together. You mentioned that you've been applying for jobs consistently, right? That in itself is a form of progress. And even though you've received rejections, each application is an opportunity to refine your skills and learn more about what employers are looking for. How does that perspective feel?\n\nPatient: I guess that makes sense. It's just hard to stay positive when I feel like I'm not getting anywhere.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid feeling, Emilio. It's okay to acknowledge the disappointment and frustration that comes with job rejections. At the same time, we can work on developing a more balanced perspective that recognizes your efforts and the small steps you're taking towards your goal. This is where the concept of cognitive distortions can be helpful. Have you noticed any patterns in your thinking that might be contributing to these negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: I think I tend to focus on the negative aspects of a situation and ignore the positives. Like, I'll dwell on the rejections and not give myself credit for the effort I'm putting in.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. This type of cognitive distortion is called \"disqualifying the positive.\" It's when we dismiss or minimize the good things that happen and only focus on the negative. Another distortion that might be at play here is \"all-or-nothing thinking,\" where we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms, like \"I'm a failure\" instead of acknowledging the shades of gray. Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see how those distortions might be affecting my thoughts. It's just hard to break out of that mindset.\n\nTherapist: It takes practice, but you've already taken the first step by recognizing these patterns. As we continue to work on thought records, we can focus on identifying and challenging these cognitive distortions. Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate negative thoughts completely, but rather to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: Great. Now, let's talk about the planned activities you engaged in. You mentioned going for a walk and cooking a nice meal for yourself. How did you feel during and after these activities?\n\nPatient: I did feel a bit better while I was doing them, but the effect didn't last very long. The negative thoughts crept back in pretty quickly.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience, Emilio. The benefits of behavioral activation might not be immediate or long-lasting at first, but with consistent practice, you'll likely start to notice a more significant impact on your mood. It's also important to remember that the goal of these activities isn't necessarily to feel happy, but rather to engage in something meaningful or enjoyable, even if it's just for a short time. This can help break the cycle of avoidance and withdrawal that often accompanies depression.",
