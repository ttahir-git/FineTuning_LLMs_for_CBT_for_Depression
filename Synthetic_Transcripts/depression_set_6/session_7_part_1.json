  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 7. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate or not fully applicable to your situation. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to handle crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and feelings openly.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me so far.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Emilio. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been feeling a bit better, but I still have moments where I struggle with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, especially when it comes to my job search. I've been trying to practice the techniques we've discussed, like thought records and behavioral activation, but it's not always easy.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've noticed some improvement, even if it's not consistent. It's completely normal to have ups and downs throughout this process. I appreciate your honesty about the challenges you're facing. Let's make sure to address those today. Before we set our agenda, is there anything else you'd like to share or any specific topics you'd like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing the negative thoughts related to my job search and self-worth. I also want to discuss how I can better incorporate the distress tolerance techniques when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. Let's start by reviewing your homework and discussing any insights or challenges you experienced while completing the thought records and engaging in planned activities. We can then explore how to apply distress tolerance techniques more effectively. As we progress through the session, we'll also touch on cognitive distortions and how they might be influencing your thoughts and feelings. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.",
