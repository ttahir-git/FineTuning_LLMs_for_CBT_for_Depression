  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 10. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted support person. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret your non-verbal cues, so please let me know if there's anything important I might be missing. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being transparent about your limitations. I feel comfortable continuing our sessions with this in mind.\n\nTherapist: Great, I appreciate your understanding. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: It's been a mixed week. I've been trying to keep up with the thought records and planned activities, but some days it's really hard to find the motivation. I did have a job interview, which I thought went well, but I haven't heard back yet. The waiting and uncertainty are triggering a lot of negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I can understand how the waiting period after a job interview can be challenging, especially when you're already dealing with depressive symptoms. Let's explore those negative thoughts further. Can you share some of the specific thoughts that have been coming up for you?\n\nPatient: I keep thinking that I must have messed up the interview somehow, or that I'm just not good enough for the job. Even though I prepared and thought I did well, the fact that I haven't heard back makes me feel like I failed.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound familiar from our previous discussions. It seems like the core belief \"I don't deserve to be happy or successful\" might be influencing these thoughts. Let's add exploring this further to our agenda for today. What else would you like to prioritize in our session?\n\nPatient: I'd like to talk more about how to cope with the uncertainty and anxiety around job searching. It's really taking a toll on my mood and motivation.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's an important topic. We can discuss some strategies for managing the stress and anxiety related to job searching, and how to maintain your mental health throughout the process. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: I'm not sure, I think that covers the main things on my mind right now.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so it sounds like our main priorities for today are:\n1. Exploring the negative thoughts related to your job interview and how they connect to your core belief \"I don't deserve to be happy or successful\"\n2. Discussing strategies for coping with uncertainty and anxiety around job searching\n3. Checking in on your progress with thought records and planned activities\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you? Is there anything you'd like to add or change?",
