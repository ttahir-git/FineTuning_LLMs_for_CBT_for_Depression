  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 6. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information or lack the ability to interpret non-verbal cues. If you ever experience a crisis or need emergency services, please seek help from a qualified professional or call emergency services immediately. With that said, let's start by checking in on how you've been doing since our last session. How have you been feeling, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like thought records and engaging in planned activities. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood. I still struggle with feelings of worthlessness and self-criticism, especially when it comes to my job search. I haven't had much success there, which has been discouraging.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we've discussed, and it's encouraging that you've noticed some small improvements in your mood. It's understandable that the job search process can be discouraging, and it's common for those challenges to impact your thoughts and feelings. Let's make sure to discuss your job search experiences further during our session today. For now, can you share a bit more about the planned activities you've engaged in and how they've affected your mood?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to go for walks regularly, and I've also been cooking more often. I find that when I'm engaged in these activities, I feel a bit more relaxed and less focused on my negative thoughts. However, the effects seem to be temporary, and the negative thoughts tend to creep back in after a while.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been engaging in walks and cooking, and it's encouraging to hear that these activities provide some relief from your negative thoughts, even if it's temporary. This is a good sign that behavioral activation can be helpful for you. As we continue to work on these techniques, the goal is to gradually increase the duration and frequency of the positive effects. Let's also explore how we can combine behavioral activation with thought records to address the negative thoughts that creep back in. Before we dive deeper into that, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize in our discussion today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my job search struggles and how they've been affecting my mood and self-esteem. I also want to discuss how I can better manage the negative thoughts that keep coming back, even after engaging in planned activities.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a productive plan for our session today. We can start by discussing your job search experiences and the thoughts and feelings that arise from them. Then, we can explore how to combine behavioral activation with thought records to address the recurring negative thoughts. We'll also make sure to save some time at the end to discuss your homework for the coming week. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.",
