  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 13. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've been providing me. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the thought records and behavioral experiments we discussed. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood. I'm still struggling with the job search process, though. It feels like I'm not making much progress, and it's taking a toll on my self-esteem.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on the thought records and behavioral experiments, and that you've noticed some improvements in your mood. It's understandable that the job search process is still challenging and impacting your self-esteem. Let's make sure to discuss that further today. How about we start by setting an agenda for our session? What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my job search struggles and how they're affecting my mental health. I also want to discuss my progress with the thought records and see if there are any adjustments I can make. And maybe we could explore some strategies for improving my self-esteem and dealing with the feelings of rejection that come with the job search process.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great agenda, Emilio. We can definitely discuss your job search struggles and their impact on your mental health, review your progress with the thought records, and explore strategies for improving your self-esteem and dealing with feelings of rejection. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main things I wanted to discuss. I'm open to any other suggestions you might have as well.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's start with your job search struggles. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing and how it's been affecting your mental health?",
