  "transcript": "Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. It's like I can't shake off this constant sadness and emptiness.\n\nTherapist: I understand that you've been struggling with feelings of sadness and emptiness. Can you tell me more about how these feelings have been affecting your daily life?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up multiple times during the night. It's exhausting.\n\nTherapist: Difficulty sleeping is a common symptom of depression. How has the lack of sleep been impacting your energy levels and ability to function during the day?\n\nPatient: I feel tired all the time. Even the simplest tasks seem overwhelming. I don't have the energy or motivation to do anything.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like the combination of depression and sleep disturbances is really taking a toll on your daily functioning. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or eating habits?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I've lost my appetite. I don't enjoy food like I used to. I've lost some weight because I just don't feel like eating.\n\nTherapist: Changes in appetite and weight loss are also common symptoms of depression. Let's shift gears a bit and talk about your personal history. You mentioned that you moved to a new city after completing your education. How has that transition been for you?\n\nPatient: It's been really challenging. I thought moving here would open up new opportunities, but I've been struggling to find a job in my field. It's frustrating and discouraging.\n\nTherapist: The stress of moving to a new city and the difficulty finding employment can certainly contribute to feelings of depression. How has this experience affected your sense of self-worth and identity?\n\nPatient: It's made me question everything. I feel like a failure. I worked so hard to get my degree, and now I can't even find a job. It's like I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: It's common for individuals experiencing depression to have negative thoughts about themselves and their abilities. We'll work on challenging those thoughts and developing a more balanced perspective. I also wanted to ask about your support system. Who do you turn to for emotional support during this difficult time?\n\nPatient: I don't really have many people to turn to. I attend a veterans support group, but I haven't made any close connections there. I find it hard to open up to people.\n\nTherapist: It can be challenging to build a support system, especially when you're dealing with depression. We can explore ways to help you connect with others and develop a stronger support network. Before we move on, I want to check in with you. How are you feeling after discussing these topics?",
