  "transcript": "Patient: The job search has been really tough. I've been applying to so many positions, but I rarely hear back. When I do get interviews, I feel like I'm not presenting myself well, and I end up getting rejected. It's making me feel like I'm not good enough and that I'll never find a job that fulfills me.\n\nTherapist: I can understand how discouraging and frustrating the job search process can be, especially when you're putting in so much effort and not seeing the results you hope for. It's common for these experiences to trigger negative thoughts and feelings about ourselves. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you felt rejected or not good enough during the job search?\n\nPatient: Well, last week I had an interview for a position that I thought I was really qualified for. I prepared a lot and felt like I had a good understanding of the company and the role. But during the interview, I stumbled over a few questions and didn't feel like I was able to articulate my experience as well as I wanted to. A few days later, I got an email saying they had chosen another candidate. It just made me feel like I'm not cut out for this field and that I'll never be successful.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that experience, Emilio. It sounds like that interview and the subsequent rejection triggered some strong negative thoughts and emotions. Let's break this down using a thought record. First, can you identify the emotions you felt when you received that rejection email and rate their intensity on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt really disappointed and sad, maybe an 80. I also felt frustrated with myself, around a 75. And I guess I felt hopeless, like a 90, because it made me think I'll never find a job.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so disappointment at 80, frustration at 75, and hopelessness at 90. Those are strong emotions. Now, let's identify the automatic thoughts that went through your mind when you received the rejection email. What were you telling yourself in that moment?\n\nPatient: I was thinking things like, \"I'm never going to get a job,\" \"I'm not good enough for this field,\" and \"I'm a failure.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are some harsh and self-critical thoughts, Emilio. I want to acknowledge that those thoughts are valid and understandable given the situation, but I also want to help you examine them more closely. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm not good enough for this field.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I haven't been able to find a job in this field despite applying to so many positions. And when I do get interviews, I often don't make it to the next round. It feels like if I were good enough, I would have found something by now.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, and I understand how those experiences can make you question your qualifications. Now, let's look at the evidence against the thought \"I'm not good enough for this field.\" What are some reasons or experiences that suggest you are, in fact, good enough?\n\nPatient: I guess I did really well in my graduate program and had some great internships. My professors always told me I had a lot of potential. And I do have skills and knowledge in this field, even if I'm not always able to convey them perfectly in interviews.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, those are important pieces of evidence to consider. You have a strong educational background and relevant experience, and you've received positive feedback from professors who know the field well. It's also important to remember that the job search process is challenging for many people, and it doesn't necessarily reflect your worth or qualifications. Let's try to reframe that original thought in a more balanced way. What's an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence for and against the original thought?",
