  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by discussing your job search experiences and how they've been affecting your mood and self-esteem. Can you tell me more about the challenges you've faced and the thoughts that have been going through your mind?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been applying to jobs almost every day, but I rarely hear back from employers. When I do get interviews, I feel like I'm not good enough or qualified enough, even though I have a Master's degree. It's been really discouraging, and I can't help but think that I'm a failure.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like the job search process has been taking a toll on your self-esteem and triggering negative thoughts about yourself. The constant rejection and lack of response from employers can be incredibly challenging. I want to acknowledge the effort you've been putting into your job search, despite the difficulties you've faced. It takes a lot of resilience to keep pushing forward in the face of repeated setbacks.\n\nPatient: Thank you for acknowledging that. It's just hard not to feel like a failure when I can't seem to get a job in my field, even with my qualifications.\n\nTherapist: I understand how frustrating and disheartening that must feel. Let's take a closer look at the thought that you're a failure. Can you think of any evidence that contradicts this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the fact that I was able to complete my Master's degree shows that I'm capable of achieving something significant. And I have had some interviews, so there must be some employers who see potential in me.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. Completing a Master's degree is a substantial accomplishment, and it demonstrates your intelligence, dedication, and work ethic. The fact that you've been invited to interviews also suggests that employers recognize your qualifications and potential. These pieces of evidence challenge the idea that you're a failure.\n\nPatient: I see what you mean, but it's still hard to shake that feeling, especially when I'm constantly facing rejection.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. Challenging deeply ingrained negative thoughts takes time and practice. One way to start shifting your perspective is by focusing on the process rather than the outcome. Instead of judging your worth based on whether or not you get a job offer, try to acknowledge the effort you're putting into the job search process itself. Each application, each interview, is a step forward, regardless of the outcome.\n\nPatient: I hadn't thought about it that way before. Focusing on the process does make it feel a bit less overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By shifting your focus to the process and the actions you're taking, you can start to build a sense of accomplishment and self-efficacy, even in the face of setbacks. Remember, your worth is not defined by your employment status. You have inherent value as a person, regardless of whether or not you have a job.\n\nPatient: That's a powerful reminder. I guess I've been tying my self-worth too closely to my job search success.\n\nTherapist: Many people struggle with tying their self-worth to external factors like job success, so you're not alone in that. It's something we can continue to work on together. Speaking of the job search, let's explore how you can combine behavioral activation with thought records to manage the negative thoughts that arise during the process. Can you walk me through a specific situation where you found yourself feeling discouraged or down about your job search?",
