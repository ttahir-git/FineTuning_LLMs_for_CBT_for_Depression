  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss today?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the skills we discussed, like challenging negative thoughts and incorporating more enjoyable activities into my routine. It hasn't been easy, but I do feel like I'm making some progress. I'm still struggling with sleep and finding a job, which continues to impact my mood. I often find myself feeling hopeless and questioning my self-worth.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've discussed, even though it's been challenging. It's common to face setbacks and difficulties along the way, but the fact that you're noticing some progress is a positive sign. I understand that the job search and sleep issues are still weighing heavily on your mind and affecting your mood. Let's make sure to address these concerns during our session today.\n\nBefore we dive in, let's set an agenda for our time together. What would you like to prioritize in our session today? I want to ensure that we focus on the topics that are most important to you.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my job search struggles and how they're impacting my mental health. It's been really tough not being able to find work in my field, and I often feel like a failure because of it. I'd also like to discuss my sleep issues, as I know they're connected to my overall well-being. Finally, I want to touch on my progress with the homework assignments and see if there are any adjustments we should make.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a solid plan, Emilio. We can definitely explore how your job search is affecting your mental health and work on developing some coping strategies. We'll also look at your sleep issues and see if we can identify any patterns or factors that might be contributing to the problem. And of course, we'll review your homework progress and make any necessary adjustments to ensure that you're getting the most out of our sessions.\n\nLet's start with the job search. Can you tell me more about your experience and the thoughts and emotions that come up for you during this process?",
