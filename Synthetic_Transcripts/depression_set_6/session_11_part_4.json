  "transcript": "Patient: Those ideas do resonate with me. I think joining a group or taking a class could be a good way to meet people who share my interests. It's just hard to put myself out there sometimes.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel nervous about putting yourself out there, but taking small steps can make it feel more manageable. Maybe we could brainstorm some specific groups or classes that might interest you, and then set a goal for you to attend one in the next week or two.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I've been wanting to get back into singing, so maybe I could look for a local choir or singing group to join.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Emilio! Singing is something you enjoy, and joining a group could be a great way to meet people who share that interest. Let's add that to your list of goals for the next week.\n\nBefore we wrap up, I want to check in on your progress with behavioral activation. How has it been going with engaging in planned activities and tracking your mood?\n\nPatient: It's been going okay. I've been trying to do at least one planned activity each day, like going for a walk or cooking a nice meal for myself. I've noticed that my mood does tend to improve after I do something enjoyable, even if it's just a small thing.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Emilio! It's good that you're noticing the impact of planned activities on your mood. Even small things can make a difference. As we continue with behavioral activation, we can work on gradually increasing the number and variety of planned activities, so that you have a range of options to choose from.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I think having more options would be helpful, especially on days when I'm feeling less motivated.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Having a variety of options can make it easier to find something that feels manageable, even on tougher days. And remember, the goal isn't to feel happy all the time, but rather to engage in activities that provide a sense of accomplishment or enjoyment, even if it's just a little bit.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, I want to summarize what we've discussed and assign some homework for the next week. We talked about the challenges you've been facing with the job search and how it's been impacting your mood. We discussed strategies for managing job search-related stress, including setting small goals and prioritizing self-care. We also talked about the importance of social connection and brainstormed some ways to meet new people, like joining a singing group. And we checked in on your progress with behavioral activation and planned activities.\n\nFor homework, I'd like you to continue with the thought records, focusing on job search-related thoughts. I'd also like you to set aside dedicated time each day for the job search and for self-care activities. Try to engage in at least one planned activity each day and track your mood before and after. And finally, I'd like you to look into singing groups in your area and set a goal to attend one in the next week or two.\n\nHow does that sound? Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?\n\nPatient: That all sounds good to me. I think the homework is manageable and will help me stay on track with the things we've been working on. I don't have any questions right now.\n\nTherapist: Great! I'm glad the homework feels manageable to you. Remember, the goal is to take small steps and build on the progress you've already made. If you have any questions or concerns during the week, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nBefore we end, I want to check in on how you're feeling now. How are you doing after today's session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a little bit better. It's helpful to have a plan and some specific goals to work on. I know it's not going to be easy, but I feel like I have some tools to help me cope with the challenges.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling a little bit better and that you feel more equipped to cope with the challenges. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. The important thing is that you keep taking steps forward, even if they're small ones.\n\nThank you for your hard work today, Emilio. I'm proud of the progress you're making, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's plan to meet again next week at our usual time.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and encouragement. I'll see you next week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed and practiced cognitive restructuring for job search-related negative thoughts\n  - Discussed strategies for managing job search stress, including setting small goals and prioritizing self-care\n  - Explored experiences of loneliness and isolation and brainstormed ways to increase social connection\n  - Checked in on progress with behavioral activation and planned activities\n  - Discussed patient's interest in singing and set a goal to join a singing group\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Practiced identifying and challenging negative thoughts related to job search\n  - Cognitive restructuring: Examined evidence for and against negative thoughts and generated more balanced thoughts\n  - Behavioral activation: Reviewed importance of engaging in planned activities and tracking mood\n  - Goal-setting: Brainstormed small goals related to job search, self-care, and social connection\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Complete 3-4 thought records, focusing on job search-related thoughts\n  - Set aside dedicated time each day for job search and self-care activities\n  - Engage in at least one planned activity each day and track mood before and after\n  - Look into singing groups in the area and set a goal to attend one in the next week or two\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details:\n  - Demonstrated improved skill in identifying and challenging negative thoughts\n  - Expressed feeling overwhelmed by job search but also hopeful about making progress\n  - Depression symptoms remain present but may be slightly improved compared to previous sessions\n  - Patient is a 24-year-old non-binary individual of Hispanic descent, currently unemployed and living alone in a new city\n  - Patient expressed interest in singing and set a goal to join a singing group to increase social connection\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Not explicitly discussed in this session\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue monitoring patient's progress with thought records, behavioral activation, and goal-setting\n  - Address patient's job search struggles and their impact on mental health\n  - Monitor patient's depression symptoms and adjust treatment plan as necessary\n  - Follow up on patient's goal of joining a singing group and explore other ways to increase social connection\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review homework and discuss any challenges or insights\n  - Continue practicing thought records and behavioral activation techniques\n  - Explore patient's progress with cognitive restructuring and goal-setting\n  - Assess patient's depression symptoms and provide support and validation\n  - Discuss progress and challenges related to job search, self-care, and social connection",
