  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for our 12th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to working with you and supporting your journey towards better mental health. How are you doing today?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations and I appreciate you being upfront about them. I'm doing alright today, thanks for asking. It's been a challenging week, but I've been trying to apply some of the techniques we've discussed in our previous sessions.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on applying the techniques we've covered. Can you tell me more about your week and how you've been feeling? I want to get a better understanding of your current emotional state and any challenges you've faced since our last session.\n\nPatient: Well, I've been struggling with the job search process. I've been sending out applications and going to interviews, but I haven't had much success. It's been really discouraging, and I find myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns. I've been trying to use the thought records we've practiced to challenge those thoughts, but it's been difficult.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that the job search process has been taking a toll on your emotional well-being. Rejection and uncertainty can be triggering for negative thoughts and feelings. I'm glad you've been attempting to use the thought records, even though it's been challenging. Remember, it takes practice and persistence to shift those thought patterns. Can you share an example of a negative thought you've had recently related to the job search, and how you tried to reframe it?\n\nPatient: Sure. I had an interview last week that I thought went well, but I haven't heard back from the company yet. I found myself thinking, \"I must have messed up the interview. They probably found someone better.\" I tried to challenge that thought by reminding myself that the hiring process takes time, and not hearing back right away doesn't necessarily mean I didn't get the job.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of catching a negative thought and attempting to reframe it in a more balanced way. You did well in recognizing that there could be other explanations for the delay in hearing back. It's important to continue practicing this skill, as it can help reduce the emotional impact of those negative thoughts. How did you feel after reframing the thought?\n\nPatient: I felt a bit better after challenging the thought. It didn't completely take away the disappointment, but it helped me see the situation from a different perspective. I'm trying to be more patient and not jump to conclusions.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. Reframing thoughts doesn't always eliminate the difficult emotions entirely, but it can help lessen their intensity and provide a more balanced perspective. It's a skill that takes time to develop, so be patient with yourself as you continue practicing.\n\nNow, let's set an agenda for today's session. We can discuss your progress with the thought records and cognitive restructuring in more detail, as well as explore any other challenges or concerns you'd like to address. What would you like to prioritize in our time together today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on the job search stress and how it's been affecting my mood. I'm also interested in discussing some strategies for managing the disappointment and frustration that come with the process. Additionally, I want to touch on my goal of joining a singing group, as I haven't made much progress on that front.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a productive agenda, Emilio. We can definitely explore strategies for managing job search stress and the emotions that arise from it. It's also important to discuss your goal of joining a singing group and any barriers that may be getting in the way. Let's start by discussing the job search stress in more detail. Can you tell me more about how it's been impacting your mood and overall well-being?",
