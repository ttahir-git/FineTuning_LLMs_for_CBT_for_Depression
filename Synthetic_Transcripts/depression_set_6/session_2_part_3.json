  "transcript": "Therapist: You've mentioned feeling overwhelmed by your emotions at times. Can you tell me more about what that experience is like for you?\n\nPatient: It's like my emotions are this big, uncontrollable wave that just sweeps me away. I feel so consumed by them that I can't think straight or focus on anything else.\n\nTherapist: That sounds really intense and challenging. When you're feeling overwhelmed by your emotions, what thoughts tend to go through your mind?\n\nPatient: I usually start thinking that I'm never going to feel better, that I'm always going to be stuck in this dark place. I feel hopeless and like I'm not in control of my own life.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are really common in depression, and they can make the emotional overwhelm feel even more intense. As we continue with CBT, we'll work on identifying those thoughts and finding ways to challenge them. We'll also develop coping strategies to help you manage the intensity of your emotions when they feel overwhelming.\n\nPatient: That would be really helpful. I feel like I've been at the mercy of my emotions for so long.\n\nTherapist: You've already taken a big step by starting therapy and being willing to explore these challenges. As we move forward, it's important that we set some specific goals for our work together. Based on what you've shared so far, some potential goals could be learning to identify and challenge negative thought patterns, developing healthy coping strategies for managing emotions, and working towards building a life that feels meaningful and fulfilling to you. What are your thoughts on those potential goals?\n\nPatient: Those all sound really important to me. I especially want to focus on finding ways to cope with my emotions in a healthy way and building a life that feels meaningful.\n\nTherapist: Those are great goals, and we can definitely work towards those in our sessions. Another important part of CBT is homework assignments between sessions. Homework helps you practice the skills we discuss in therapy in your everyday life. It might include things like keeping a thought record, practicing emotion regulation techniques, or engaging in activities that align with your values and goals.\n\nPatient: I'm willing to put in the work outside of sessions if it will help me feel better in the long run.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Homework is a really important part of the therapeutic process, and it can help you make progress more quickly. As we start to introduce specific coping strategies and techniques, we'll discuss homework assignments that can help you practice those skills in your daily life.\n\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense. I'm ready to start making some changes.",
