  "transcript": "Patient: The job search has been really tough. I send out so many applications, but I rarely hear back. When I do get an interview, I feel like I mess it up somehow. I start thinking that I'm not good enough and that I'll never find a job in my field. It's hard not to take it personally.\n\nTherapist: I can understand how discouraging and frustrating the job search process can be, especially when you're putting in so much effort and not seeing the results you hope for. It's common to have negative thoughts and self-doubt in these situations. Let's explore this further.\n\nCan you think of a recent situation during your job search when you noticed these negative thoughts coming up? Let's try to identify the specific thoughts and emotions you experienced.\n\nPatient: Sure, just last week I had an interview for a position that I thought I was really qualified for. I prepared a lot, but during the interview, I felt like I stumbled over some of my answers. Afterwards, I kept thinking, \"I should have said this instead\" or \"I sounded so unsure of myself.\" I felt really disappointed and anxious, like I had ruined my chances.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. It's a great opportunity for us to practice using a thought record. Let's break down the situation and identify the emotions, automatic thoughts, and evidence for and against those thoughts.\n\nFirst, what emotions did you notice during and after the interview? Can you rate their intensity on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: During the interview, I mostly felt anxious, maybe around 80 out of 100. After the interview, I felt disappointed, around 90, and still anxious, maybe 70.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so anxiety and disappointment were the primary emotions. Now, let's identify the automatic thoughts that went through your mind. You mentioned thinking, \"I should have said this instead\" and \"I sounded so unsure of myself.\" Were there any other thoughts?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I also thought, \"They probably think I'm not qualified\" and \"I'll never get a job.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are important thoughts to recognize. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the thought, \"I'll never get a job\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been searching for months and haven't had any offers. I've had a few interviews, but nothing has worked out.\n\nTherapist: And what about evidence against that thought?\n\nPatient: I guess I have had some interviews, so that means there's some interest in my qualifications. And I know the job market is tough right now, so it might not be entirely about me.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. It's important to consider factors outside of yourself that could be influencing the situation. Now, let's look at the thought, \"I sounded so unsure of myself.\" What evidence do you have for and against that thought?\n\nPatient: For the thought, I remember stumbling over a few answers and feeling nervous. But against the thought, I did prepare a lot beforehand, and I know I had some good answers too. It might not have been as bad as I think.\n\nTherapist: That's a good observation. Our perception of a situation can sometimes be distorted by our emotions and negative thoughts. Now, let's try to come up with an alternative, more balanced thought based on the evidence.\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I did my best to prepare, and even though I stumbled on a few answers, I also had some good points. One interview doesn't determine my entire future.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges the challenges while also recognizing your efforts and keeping the situation in perspective. How do you feel when you consider this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit less anxious and disappointed. Maybe more like 50 out of 100 for both.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in intensity. This shows how challenging our negative thoughts and considering alternative perspectives can help us feel better.\n\nAs you continue with your job search, try to practice this process of identifying your thoughts, examining the evidence, and generating alternative thoughts. It takes time and practice, but it can help you maintain a more balanced and resilient mindset.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely try to keep practicing. It's not easy, but I can see how it might help me feel less discouraged.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're willing to keep working on it. Remember, it's a skill that develops over time, so be patient with yourself.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and talk about your sleep issues. How has your sleep been since our last session?",
