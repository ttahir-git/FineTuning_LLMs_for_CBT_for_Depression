  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's practice cognitive restructuring with a job search-related thought. Can you think of a recent negative thought you had about your job search?\n\nPatient: Sure. I had a thought just yesterday that \"I'll never find a job that makes me happy.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's examine that thought. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been searching for months and haven't found anything that feels like a good fit. And even when I do get interviews, I never seem to get offers.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess I have had some interviews, so there must be something about my qualifications that appeals to employers. And I know the job market is tough right now, so it might not be entirely about me.\n\nTherapist: Good. Now, based on this evidence, what might be a more balanced thought?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like \"It's taking longer than I'd like to find a job that feels right for me, but that doesn't mean it'll never happen. I have qualifications that appeal to some employers, and the current job market is challenging for everyone.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great restructured thought. It acknowledges the challenges you're facing while also recognizing your strengths and the external factors at play. As you continue your job search, try to practice this kind of restructuring whenever you notice negative thoughts popping up.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best. It's hard to remember to do it in the moment, but I'll keep trying.\n\nTherapist: It takes practice, but it will get easier over time. Another helpful technique is to schedule \"worry time.\" Set aside a specific time each day, maybe 15-20 minutes, to focus on your job search worries. When worries come up outside of that time, remind yourself that you'll deal with them during your scheduled worry time.\n\nPatient: That's an interesting idea. I've never tried anything like that before.\n\nTherapist: It can be a helpful way to contain the anxiety and prevent it from taking over your whole day. Just make sure to stick to the scheduled time and don't let it spill over into the rest of your day.\n\nPatient: I'll give it a try and see how it goes.\n\nTherapist: Great. As we wrap up today's session, let's assign some homework. I'd like you to continue practicing thought records, focusing on job search-related thoughts. Try to do at least 3-4 over the next week. Also, keep engaging in planned activities and tracking your mood. And try scheduling worry time each day to manage your job search anxiety. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: It sounds like a lot, but I know it's important. I'll do my best to stick with it.\n\nTherapist: Remember, you don't have to do it all perfectly. Every small step you take is progress. And we'll keep working on these skills together in our sessions.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder. I appreciate your support.\n\nTherapist: Before we end, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also hopeful. It helps to have some specific strategies to work on.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Remember, change takes time, but you're making steady progress. If you have any questions or concerns between now and our next session, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient: I will.
