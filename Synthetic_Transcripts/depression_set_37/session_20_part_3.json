  "transcript": "Patient: Some of the key tools in my CBT 'toolbox' are the thought records, stress management techniques like deep breathing, and self-compassionate self-talk. I've also found the problem-solving skills helpful for breaking down challenges into smaller steps.\n\nTherapist: Those are all excellent tools to have in your 'toolbox'. Being able to recognize and challenge negative thoughts, manage stress, practice self-compassion, and break down problems into manageable steps are crucial skills for maintaining your progress. Let's practice applying some of these skills to a current challenge you're facing. Can you share a situation where you've been struggling to use your CBT tools?\n\nPatient: One situation that comes to mind is dealing with criticism at work. I've been working on a big project, and my boss has been giving me a lot of feedback. Even though I know it's meant to be constructive, I still find myself getting defensive and beating myself up over it.\n\nTherapist: Dealing with criticism, even when it's constructive, can be challenging - especially if you struggle with perfectionism and self-criticism. Let's break this down using the CBT tools you've learned. When you receive feedback from your boss, what thoughts tend to run through your mind?\n\nPatient: I usually start thinking things like \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I'll never get this right.\" It feels like any feedback, even if it's meant to be helpful, is just confirmation that I'm failing.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like perfectionistic thoughts that could be contributing to feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. Let's challenge those thoughts using a thought record. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're \"not good enough\" or \"failing\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the fact that my boss is giving me feedback in the first place. If I were doing everything right, he wouldn't need to correct me.\n\nTherapist: That's one perspective. But is it possible that your boss's feedback is not a reflection of your overall worth or abilities, but rather an opportunity for growth and improvement?\n\nPatient: I suppose that's possible. My boss has told me before that he sees potential in me and wants to help me develop my skills.\n\nTherapist: That's an important piece of evidence to consider. What about times when you've received positive feedback or successfully completed a project? How does that fit with the belief that you're \"not good enough\"?\n\nPatient: It's true that I have had successes at work too. I've received praise and positive feedback on other projects. I guess I tend to focus more on the negative feedback than the positive.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Focusing on the negative while discounting the positive is a common cognitive distortion called \"mental filter.\" It sounds like you're recognizing that your boss's feedback doesn't necessarily mean you're failing, but rather that there's room for growth and improvement. How does reframing it that way feel?\n\nPatient: It feels a bit more balanced. Like, I don't have to be perfect to be valuable or capable. Feedback can help me learn and grow, even if it's not always easy to hear.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Reframing feedback as an opportunity for growth, rather than a sign of failure, can help you approach it with a more balanced and self-compassionate perspective. Another tool that could be helpful here is self-compassionate self-talk. How could you respond to yourself with kindness and understanding when you receive feedback?\n\nPatient: I could remind myself that everyone has room for improvement, and that feedback is a normal part of learning and growing. I could also acknowledge that I'm trying my best and that my worth isn't dependent on being perfect.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of self-compassionate self-talk. Acknowledging your efforts, recognizing the normalcy of feedback and growth, and separating your worth from perfectionism are all powerful ways to support yourself. As you continue to practice these skills, you may find it helpful to create coping cards with reminders of these adaptive thoughts and strategies. You could write down some of these self-compassionate statements and keep them handy for when you're facing challenging situations like receiving feedback.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. Having those reminders on hand could help me stay grounded and balanced when I'm feeling defensive or self-critical.\n\nTherapist: Coping cards can be a great tool for reinforcing the skills you've learned and supporting yourself in challenging moments. Remember, the goal isn't to never have perfectionistic thoughts or feelings of self-doubt, but rather to recognize them when they arise and respond to them with self-compassion and balance.",
