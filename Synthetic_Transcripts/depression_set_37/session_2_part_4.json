  "transcript": "Therapist: You've shown a lot of insight and openness today, Alejandro. I'm really encouraged by your willingness to engage with these concepts and try out some new strategies. Before we wrap up, let's review the main points we've covered and set a small homework task to help you practice between sessions.\n\nPatient: Sounds good. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also hopeful.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable. We've covered a lot of ground today! The main things we discussed were:\n\n1. The cognitive model in CBT, which shows how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. We explored how negative thoughts can lead to difficult emotions and unhelpful behaviors, like withdrawal.\n\n2. Cognitive distortions, which are exaggerated or inaccurate thought patterns that contribute to depression. We identified some that you struggle with, like all-or-nothing thinking and disqualifying the positive.\n\n3. The importance of setting clear, specific goals for therapy. You mentioned wanting to build confidence, improve relationships, and find healthier coping strategies.\n\n4. The role of homework in practicing skills between sessions. We talked about starting small and adjusting as needed to make sure it feels manageable.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue monitoring your thoughts using the thought record. Try to catch at least one negative thought per day, and jot down the situation, the emotion, and the behavior that goes with it. Then, see if you can identify any cognitive distortions in that thought, like we practiced today.\n\nPatient: Okay, I think I can handle that. It's just one thought per day, right?\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Start small and build from there. And remember, the goal isn't to be perfect, but just to start noticing these patterns. If you have any trouble or questions, feel free to bring them up in our next session.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you for all your help today, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Alejandro. I'm really proud of the work you've done today.
