  "transcript": "Patient: In terms of building confidence, I'd like to be able to recognize my own accomplishments and not discount them. For improving relationships, I want to work on opening up to others and not isolating myself when I'm feeling down. And for coping strategies, I'd like to find healthier ways to manage stress that don't involve withdrawing or being too hard on myself.\n\nTherapist: Those are great goals, Alejandro. Let's make them even more specific and measurable. For building confidence, how about setting a goal to identify at least one accomplishment each day, no matter how small, and write it down in a journal? For improving relationships, you could aim to reach out to a friend or family member at least once a week, even if it's just a short phone call or text message. And for coping strategies, we could work on developing a list of healthy activities you can turn to when you're feeling stressed, such as going for a walk, listening to music, or practicing deep breathing exercises.\n\nPatient: That sounds manageable. I like the idea of having specific actions to focus on.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. As we work towards these goals, we'll use various CBT techniques to help you build the skills you need. One of the core techniques we'll be using is called thought recording. This involves identifying negative thoughts, examining the evidence for and against them, and developing more balanced and helpful thoughts. We'll practice this skill together in session, and you can also use it on your own between sessions.\n\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense. Can we try an example now?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Let's start with a thought you had this past week that bothered you. What was the situation, and what was the thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I was at work and I made a small mistake on a project. My immediate thought was, \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Now, let's examine the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're a failure and can't do anything right?\n\nPatient: I guess the fact that I made a mistake on the project could be seen as evidence.\n\nTherapist: Okay, and what about evidence against that thought? What are some examples of times when you have done things right or succeeded at work?\n\nPatient: Well, I've completed a lot of successful projects in the past. And even on this project, there were many parts that I did well. It was just one small mistake.\n\nTherapist: That's important to recognize. So, based on the evidence, what would be a more balanced and helpful thought?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I made a mistake, but that doesn't mean I'm a failure. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and I've had many successes in the past.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic thought. How does it feel to reframe it that way?\n\nPatient: It feels better. Less harsh and more hopeful.\n\nTherapist: That's the power of thought recording. By examining the evidence and developing more balanced thoughts, we can start to shift our perspective and feel better. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the easier it becomes.\n\nPatient: I can see how that could be helpful. I'll try to practice it this week.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Alejandro. Remember, it's okay if it feels challenging at first. The important thing is to keep practicing and be patient with yourself. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your guidance and encouragement.",
