  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like cognitive restructuring and self-compassion. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and overall outlook. I still struggle with negative thoughts and self-critical beliefs, but I'm working on reframing them in a more balanced way.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. Change takes time, and it's normal to face challenges along the way. I'm here to support you through this process. Let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. We can review your homework, discuss your progress and any challenges you've encountered, and explore additional techniques for managing perfectionism and promoting self-compassion. Does that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I'd also like to discuss some strategies for prioritizing self-care, as I've been struggling to make time for it with my busy work schedule. And maybe we could explore some ways to challenge my core belief about needing to be perfect to be worthy.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss strategies for prioritizing self-care and explore ways to challenge that core belief. It's an important topic, and I'm glad you brought it up. Let's start by reviewing your homework from the last session. How did you find the process of using thought records to identify and challenge negative thoughts?",
