  "transcript": "Therapist: Welcome back, Alejandro! It's great to see you again for our second session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to start by acknowledging that while I'm here to support you, there are some limitations to keep in mind. As an AI, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times, so please feel free to correct me if something doesn't seem right. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, so if you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, it's essential to reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted person in your life. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like facial expressions or body language. With that said, I'm committed to doing my best to support you throughout this therapeutic process. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. It's good to know what to expect. I'm just eager to get started and make some progress.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Alejandro. Before we dive in, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. We'll start by reviewing the homework I assigned last time, which was keeping a thought record. Then, I'd like to introduce the CBT framework and explore how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors might be interconnected. We'll also discuss some of the specific thought patterns that may be contributing to your depression. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm curious to learn more about the CBT framework and how it can help me.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's begin by reviewing your thought record. Were you able to notice any negative thoughts throughout the week and jot them down along with the associated emotions and behaviors?\n\nPatient: Yes, I did. It was actually pretty eye-opening to see how often I have negative thoughts about myself and how they affect my mood and actions.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic insight, Alejandro. Would you feel comfortable sharing an example from your thought record?",
