  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alejandro, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in on how you've been doing since our last session. How have you been feeling, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like using thought records and practicing self-compassion. It's been challenging at times, especially when I'm stressed at work or feeling overwhelmed. I did the behavioral experiment we talked about, intentionally making a small mistake in a social situation, and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. People were more understanding than I expected.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed, even though it's been challenging at times. The fact that you followed through with the behavioral experiment is a significant step forward. It's encouraging that the outcome wasn't as negative as you anticipated, and that people were understanding. This experience can help challenge your perfectionistic beliefs and provide evidence for more balanced thoughts.\n\nLet's set an agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to review your thought records and discuss any challenges you faced while using them. We can also explore your experience with the behavioral experiment in more detail and discuss how it relates to your perfectionism and self-worth. Additionally, we can continue working on reframing your core beliefs and practicing self-compassion. What do you think about this plan, and is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?",
