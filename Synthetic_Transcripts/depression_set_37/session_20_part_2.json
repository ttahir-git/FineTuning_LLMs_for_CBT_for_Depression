  "transcript": "Patient: I think one of the biggest changes I've noticed is being able to catch those negative thoughts and challenge them. It's not always easy, but I'm getting better at recognizing when I'm being too hard on myself or setting unrealistic expectations.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant insight, Alejandro. Recognizing and challenging negative thoughts is a core skill in CBT. It's great that you're noticing progress in that area. Can you share an example of a time recently when you were able to catch and reframe a negative thought?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just last week, I made a mistake on a project at work. Normally, I would have beaten myself up about it, thinking things like \"I'm such a failure\" or \"I can't do anything right.\" But this time, I caught myself starting to go down that path and tried to reframe it. I reminded myself that everyone makes mistakes sometimes and that one mistake doesn't define my worth or abilities.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent example of catching and reframing a negative thought. You recognized the perfectionistic thoughts and actively challenged them with more balanced, self-compassionate thoughts. How did that feel in the moment?\n\nPatient: It felt... empowering, I guess.

I still felt disappointed about the mistake, but it didn't send me into a spiral of self-criticism like it might have before.\n\nTherapist: Feeling more in control of your reactions and emotions is a powerful shift. It's okay to feel disappointed about a mistake, but being able to stop the spiral of self-criticism is a huge step forward. Let's talk more about the skills and strategies you've found most helpful. What are some of the key tools in your CBT 'toolbox' that you plan to continue using?",
