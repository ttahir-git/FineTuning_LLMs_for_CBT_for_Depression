Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few limitations as your AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in our final session together.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I appreciate your transparency about your limitations. I'm feeling a mix of emotions today - proud of the progress I've made, but also a bit anxious about ending therapy and navigating things on my own.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel a mix of emotions as we approach the end of our work together. Let's start by checking in more about how you've been doing since our last session. How have you been feeling overall? Have there been any changes or challenges that have come up?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been doing alright. I've been trying to consistently use the thought records and self-compassion techniques we've practiced. It's still a challenge at times, especially when I'm stressed or tired, but I do notice a difference in my ability to catch those perfectionistic thoughts and reframe them. I've also been making an effort to reach out to my writing group and a couple of friends for support.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been consistently using the skills we've practiced and noticing a difference in your ability to manage perfectionistic thoughts. Reaching out to your writing group and friends for support is also a significant step. How have those interactions been for you?\n\nPatient: It's been helpful to connect with others who share my interests and can relate to some of my experiences. I've been trying to be more open about my struggles, and while it's not always easy, it does feel good to have that support and understanding from others.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful insight, Alejandro. Sharing your struggles with trusted others can be challenging, but it's a powerful way to build connection and realize you're not alone in your experiences. As we move into our final session, what would you like to focus on today? We can review the progress you've made, discuss plans for maintaining your gains, and explore any concerns you have about ending therapy.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to review the progress I've made and the skills I've learned, and discuss how I can continue to use them moving forward. I'm also feeling a bit anxious about ending therapy and would like to talk through that.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great agenda for our session today. We'll review your progress and the skills you've developed, discuss how you can continue to use them independently, and explore your feelings about ending therapy. Let's start by reviewing the progress you've made since we began working together. What stands out to you as some of the most significant changes or insights you've gained?",
