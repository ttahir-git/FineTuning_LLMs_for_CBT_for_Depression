  "transcript": "Therapist: I understand your frustration, Emilio. Recovery is a process, and it's normal to have ups and downs along the way. The fact that you're noticing these frustrations and bringing them up in therapy is actually a sign of progress. It shows that you're more aware of your thoughts and feelings, and that you're committed to working through challenges.\n\nPatient: I guess that's true. It's just hard to keep perspective sometimes when I'm in the middle of a tough day.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. That's why we've been working on building your toolbox of CBT skills, so that you have strategies to help you through those tough moments. In addition to the thought records and reframing techniques, another skill that can be helpful is mindfulness. Have you heard of mindfulness before?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I've heard of it, but I'm not totally sure what it means or how to do it.\n\nTherapist: Mindfulness is essentially the practice of being present and aware in the current moment, without judgment. It involves paying attention to your thoughts, feelings, and sensations, but not getting caught up in them or reacting to them automatically. Mindfulness can be a helpful tool for managing difficult emotions, because it allows you to observe your experience without being overwhelmed by it.\n\nFor example, if you're feeling really low and having thoughts like \"I'm never going to get better,\" mindfulness would involve noticing those thoughts and feelings, but not getting caught up in them or believing them to be 100% true. You might say to yourself, \"I'm noticing that I'm having the thought that I'm never going to get better. It's just a thought, not a fact.\"\n\nDoes that make sense?",
