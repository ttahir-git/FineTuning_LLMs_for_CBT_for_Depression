  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you for our 20th session today. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to supporting you in our work together. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand and appreciate you letting me know about your limitations. I'm doing alright today, thanks for asking. I've been trying to practice the skills we've been working on, but it's still a challenge at times.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you've been practicing the skills, even if it's challenging. Can you tell me more about your experience with the homework from our last session? How did it go with the thought records, reframing, and self-care activities?\n\nPatient: The thought records and reframing are getting a bit easier with practice, but I still find myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns sometimes. I did make a list of my strengths and accomplishments, which was helpful to look back on. As for self-care, I managed to go for a walk in nature, but I haven't picked up my guitar yet.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're finding the thought records and reframing helpful, even if it's not always easy. Recognizing your strengths and accomplishments is a crucial step in building that new core belief, \"I have value and can keep growing.\" Going for a walk in nature is a wonderful form of self-care. We can explore what might be holding you back from playing your guitar again. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think I'd like to talk more about that. I used to love playing guitar, but I just haven't felt motivated to do it lately.\n\nTherapist: That's a great topic for us to discuss today. Let's set an agenda for our session. We can start by reviewing your progress with the CBT Triangle, self-compassion, and relapse prevention planning. Then, we can explore your experience with the guitar and see if we can find ways to help you reconnect with that passion. We'll also check in on your progress with challenging negative core beliefs and building social connections. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I'm also wondering if we could talk about how to maintain my progress after our sessions end.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's a very important topic. We'll make sure to discuss relapse prevention planning and how you can continue supporting yourself after our sessions conclude. Let's start by reviewing your progress with the CBT Triangle. Can you give me an example of how you've noticed the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors recently?",
