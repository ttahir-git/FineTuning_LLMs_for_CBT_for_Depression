  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 16. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've been providing me. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned, but it's been challenging. I've managed to practice the guitar a couple of times, but I struggled to reach out to others. I'm still feeling down most of the time, and I'm not sure if I'm making any progress.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Emilio. It's not uncommon to face challenges when working on these skills, and progress isn't always linear. I'm glad to hear that you've been able to practice the guitar, even if it's just a couple of times. As for reaching out to others, we can explore what made it difficult and work on strategies to make it more manageable. Before we do that, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my struggles with reaching out to others and building social connections. It's something I really want to work on, but I find it so difficult. I'd also like to discuss how I can manage my negative thoughts when they become overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan, Emilio. We can definitely focus on strategies for reaching out to others and building social connections, as well as managing overwhelming negative thoughts. To start, let's explore what made it challenging for you to reach out to others since our last session. Can you tell me more about your experience and what thoughts or feelings came up for you?",
