  "transcript": "Patient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful after our discussion today. I think setting a time limit for myself when texting Carlos is a good idea. It will help me avoid getting stuck in my head for too long.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful, Emilio. Setting a time limit can be a helpful way to manage anxiety and ensure that you take action, even when it feels challenging. Remember, every small step counts, and you're making progress by reaching out to Carlos.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best to remember that. It's just hard sometimes when the negative thoughts feel so overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: I understand, Emilio. When negative thoughts feel overwhelming, it can be helpful to have a plan in place to manage them. One technique we can use is called \"worry time.\" This involves setting aside a specific time each day to focus on your worries and negative thoughts. During this time, you can write down your thoughts and challenge them using the skills we've been working on. The rest of the day, when worries come up, you can remind yourself that you'll deal with them during your designated worry time.\n\nPatient: That's an interesting idea. I like the idea of having a specific time to focus on my worries, rather than letting them take over my whole day.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It can help you gain some control over your thoughts and prevent them from interfering with your daily life. Another technique we can use is called \"thought stopping.\" When you notice yourself getting caught up in negative thoughts, you can say \"stop\" to yourself, either out loud or in your head, and then refocus your attention on something else, like your breathing or a task you're working on.\n\nPatient: I think I could try that. It might help me break out of the cycle of negative thinking.\n\nTherapist: It can be a helpful tool, Emilio. Remember, the goal isn't to get rid of negative thoughts altogether, but rather to change your relationship with them and reduce their impact on your emotions and behaviors. As we continue to practice these skills, you'll likely find it easier to manage negative thoughts when they come up.\n\nPatient: I hope so. I'm willing to keep practicing and see how it goes.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Emilio. I'm confident that with continued practice, you'll see improvements in your ability to manage negative thoughts and build the life you want for yourself. Before we wrap up today's session, let's discuss your homework for the week. I'd like you to continue adding to your Positive Data Log, gathering evidence against your negative core beliefs and supporting more adaptive beliefs. I'd also like you to set SMART goals related to reaching out to others, like texting Carlos and perhaps one other friend this week. Finally, I'd like you to practice using worry time and thought stopping when negative thoughts feel overwhelming. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll do my best to complete the homework and keep practicing the skills we've been working on.\n\nTherapist: I'm confident you will, Emilio. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there may be ups and downs along the way. The important thing is that you keep showing up for yourself and putting in the effort. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Emilio. Before we end today's session, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling now, compared to the beginning of our session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better. I still have some anxiety about reaching out to others, but I feel more hopeful and empowered to take action.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Emilio. It's normal to still feel some anxiety, but the fact that you're feeling more hopeful and empowered is a great sign of progress. Remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself as you continue to work on these skills. I'm proud of the effort you're putting in and the progress you're making.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. That means a lot to me.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Emilio. I'll see you next week for our next session. In the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out if you need support or have any questions.\n\nPatient: I will. Thanks again, Nova. See you next week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Managing overwhelming negative thoughts, building social connections, and setting SMART goals for reaching out to others.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought Records (ongoing)\n  - Positive Data Log (ongoing)\n  - Downward Arrow Technique (ongoing)\n  - Reframing (ongoing)\n  - SMART goals (ongoing)\n  - Behavioral Experiments (ongoing - setting time limits for reaching out to others)\n  - Worry Time (new)\n  - Thought Stopping (new)\n  - In future sessions, we will continue to build on these techniques and introduce new ones as needed, such as cognitive and behavioral experiments to test the validity of beliefs and address specific depressive symptoms like rumination and perfectionism.\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue adding to the Positive Data Log, gathering evidence against negative core beliefs and supporting more adaptive beliefs.\n  - Set SMART goals related to reaching out to others, like texting Carlos and perhaps one other friend this week.\n  - Practice using worry time and thought stopping when negative thoughts feel overwhelming.\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - Emilio is making progress in identifying and challenging negative thoughts and underlying beliefs related to perfectionism, worthlessness, and social connections.
