  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, so please let me know if something doesn't resonate with you. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted support person. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so I'll be relying on your written communication to understand your experiences and emotions.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I appreciate your transparency about your capabilities. I'm happy to provide any additional information you need to better support me.\n\nTherapist: Thank you, Emilio. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been feeling a bit better. I've been trying to practice the techniques we've discussed, like challenging my perfectionistic thoughts and being more self-compassionate. It's not always easy, but I think it's helping. I had a bit of a setback last week when I made a mistake at work and started feeling really down on myself, but I tried to use the thought records to work through it.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if it's not always easy. Setbacks are a normal part of the process, and it's encouraging that you were able to use the thought records to cope with the situation at work. Let's make sure to discuss that further today. For now, is there anything else you'd like to share about your experiences since our last session?\n\nPatient: Not much else, just the usual ups and downs. I did have a nice moment with my neighbor, though. She invited me over for dinner, and it felt good to connect with someone outside of work.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a positive experience. Connecting with others can be really helpful in managing depression. Let's keep that in mind as we plan our agenda for today. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to discuss the setback at work and how you used the thought records, as well as explore any other challenges or successes you've had with the homework. We should also check in on your progress with celebrating small victories and being kind to yourself. Does that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'd also like to talk more about my intermediate beliefs related to perfectionism, if we have time.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely include that in our agenda. Let's start by discussing the setback at work and how you used the thought records. Can you tell me more about what happened and walk me through how you applied the technique?",
