  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's good to see you again. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me, and there's a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm committed to doing my best to support you in managing your depression. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and I'm here to work with you to manage my depression. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by setting an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review your thought record homework from last time and begin exploring the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors within the CBT framework. We'll also start identifying some of your specific thought patterns related to your depression. How does that sound for our plan today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm curious to learn more about the CBT framework and how it can help me.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. Let's start by reviewing your thought record. Can you share some of the situations, thoughts, and emotions you documented over the past week when you felt depressed or anxious?",
