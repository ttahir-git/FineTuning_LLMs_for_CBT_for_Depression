  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I have an example from last week. I was feeling really down and didn't want to go to work. I kept thinking, \"I'm going to mess up at work, and everyone will think I'm useless.\" It made me feel even more depressed and anxious, and I ended up calling in sick.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Emilio. Let's break it down using the CBT Triangle. The thought, \"I'm going to mess up at work, and everyone will think I'm useless,\" led to feelings of depression and anxiety, which then influenced your behavior of calling in sick. Does that sound accurate?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's exactly how it felt. It's like I couldn't control my thoughts, and they just took over.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. Our thoughts can have a powerful impact on our feelings and behaviors. Now, let's apply some of the reframing skills we've been working on. Is there any evidence that contradicts the thought that you're going to mess up at work and that everyone will think you're useless?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been doing my job for a while now, and I haven't been fired yet. And my boss complimented my work on a project last month.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic evidence to counter that negative thought! You have a history of being competent at your job, and you've even received positive feedback recently. How does recognizing this evidence affect your feelings and the likelihood of calling in sick?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel a bit better, like maybe I'm not as useless as I think. I guess I would be less likely to call in sick if I reminded myself of these things.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! By challenging those negative thoughts with evidence, we can start to shift our feelings and behaviors in a more positive direction. This is a skill you can continue to practice even after our sessions end. Speaking of which, let's discuss your concerns about maintaining your progress after therapy. What worries you most about this transition?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm just worried that I'll fall back into old habits and thought patterns without having these regular sessions to keep me on track.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, Emilio. It's normal to feel a bit anxious about ending therapy. Let's create a relapse prevention plan to help you maintain your progress. One helpful tool is to create coping cards with reminders of the skills you've learned and evidence against your negative core beliefs. What might you include on your coping cards?\n\nPatient: I could write down some of the evidence that challenges my negative thoughts, like the positive feedback from my boss. And maybe some reminders of the reframing and self-compassion skills we've practiced.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent ideas for your coping cards! You can also include reminders of your new core belief, \"I have value and can keep growing.\" Another important part of your relapse prevention plan is identifying early warning signs that your depression might be worsening. What signs do you think you should watch out for?\n\nPatient: I guess if I start isolating myself more, or if I lose interest in things I usually enjoy, like going for walks or playing guitar.\n\nTherapist: Those are great early warning signs to be aware of. If you notice these signs, what coping strategies can you use to help yourself?\n\nPatient: I could try to reach out to a friend or do something small that I enjoy, like listening to music or reading a book. And I could review my coping cards and practice the skills we've worked on.\n\nTherapist: Those are fantastic coping strategies, Emilio! Remember, setbacks are a normal part of the recovery process. The key is to catch them early and use your skills to get back on track. It's also important to have a support system in place. Who are some people in your life that you can reach out to for support?\n\nPatient: I have a couple of close friends from my neighborhood who I know I can count on. And I've been thinking about joining a support group for LGBTQ+ veterans.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful that you have supportive friends, and joining a support group is a great idea! Connecting with others who have similar experiences can be incredibly validating and helpful. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. I'm also here to support you, even after our regular sessions end. You can always reach out if you need a booster session or just someone to talk to.\n\nPatient: That's really comforting to know. I feel a bit more confident about maintaining my progress now.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that, Emilio. You've made incredible progress in our work together, and I have full confidence in your ability to continue using these skills independently. Remember, recovery is a journey, and there will be ups and downs. Be patient and compassionate with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate all your help and support throughout this process.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Emilio. It's been an honor to work with you and witness your growth. Let's continue to explore your experience with the guitar and see if we can find ways to help you reconnect with that passion. What do you think might be holding you back from playing again?",
