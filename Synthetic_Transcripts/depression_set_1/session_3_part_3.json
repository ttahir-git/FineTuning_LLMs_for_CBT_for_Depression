  "transcript": "Patient: I notice all-or-nothing thinking, like I'm either good at guitar or not at all. And fortune telling, jumping to the conclusion that I'll never get better.\n\nTherapist: Great observations, Emilio! Those are exactly the kinds of cognitive distortions we want to catch. Now, let's try reframing that thought in a more balanced way. What's a more realistic and helpful way to view this situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"I'm still learning and improving. Making mistakes is part of the process. If I keep practicing, I will gradually get better over time.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent reframing, Emilio! That thought acknowledges the challenge but also recognizes your ability to grow and improve. How does that more balanced thought feel compared to the original negative one?\n\nPatient: It feels more hopeful and motivating. Like I can keep going even if it's hard sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. This is a great example of how reframing our thoughts can impact our emotions and motivation. As we continue with therapy, we'll practice catching and reframing negative thoughts like this more and more. \n\nPatient: I'm looking forward to getting better at it. It's nice to have a tool to use when I'm feeling down on myself.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, it's a powerful tool for building resilience. Speaking of tools, another key part of CBT is developing a strong therapeutic relationship. I want you to feel safe, supported, and empowered in our work together. How are you feeling about our rapport so far? Is there anything I can do to help you feel more comfortable?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling good about it so far. You've been really understanding and non-judgmental. I appreciate you explaining things clearly and giving me a chance to practice skills in session.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that, Emilio. Your feedback is important to me. Please always feel free to let me know if there's anything I can do to better support you. \n\nPatient: I will, thank you. I do have one question about therapy. How long does CBT usually take? I know everyone is different, but what's a typical timeframe?\n\nTherapist: That's a great question. The length of CBT can vary depending on the individual and their goals. Typically, a course of CBT lasts between 12-20 sessions. We'll regularly assess your progress and adjust our plan as needed. Remember, therapy is a collaborative process - we'll work together to decide when you feel ready to transition out of regular sessions.",
