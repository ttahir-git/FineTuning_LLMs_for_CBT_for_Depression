  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying to do the homework you assigned, but it's been tough. I did the deep breathing and grounding exercises a few times, and they helped a bit in the moment. But I keep forgetting to use them when I'm really stressed or down.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been practicing the distress tolerance techniques, even if it's been challenging to remember them in the moment. Building new habits takes time and practice. Let's explore what might be getting in the way of using these techniques when you need them most. Can you think of a specific situation where you struggled to remember to use the skills?\n\nPatient: Yeah, just the other day at work, I made a mistake on a project, and my boss called me out on it in front of everyone. I felt so embarrassed and upset, but I didn't even think to use the deep breathing or grounding exercises until hours later when I was at home.\n\nTherapist: That's a really tough situation, and it's understandable that you felt embarrassed and upset. In moments like these, it's common to get caught up in the emotion and forget to use our coping skills. One strategy that can help is to create a visual reminder of the techniques you've learned. This could be a small card with the steps written out, or even a discreet symbol that you associate with the skill, like a sticker or a drawing. You could keep this reminder in your wallet or on your phone, so it's easily accessible when you need it.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I could probably set a reminder on my phone to practice the techniques every day, too. I think I just need to make it a habit.\n\nTherapist: Setting a daily reminder is an excellent way to build the habit. As you practice the techniques more regularly, it will become easier to remember to use them in challenging moments. Another strategy is to pair the techniques with an existing habit, like doing deep breathing every time you wash your hands or using a grounding exercise whenever you sit down to eat. This can help integrate the skills into your daily routine.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I'll try doing the deep breathing every time I take a break at work. That way, it'll be easier to remember when I'm stressed on the job.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan! Let's talk a bit more about your experience with the thought records. How did you find that process?\n\nPatient: It was hard at first, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of it. I noticed that a lot of my negative thoughts are related to feeling like I'm not good enough or that I'm going to fail at everything I try.\n\nTherapist: It's really insightful that you've been able to identify those common themes in your negative thoughts. These are what we call \"core beliefs\" \u2013 deep-seated beliefs about ourselves, others, and the world that often develop in childhood and can influence how we interpret situations throughout our lives. When we have negative core beliefs, it can lead to a pattern of automatic negative thoughts that contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety.\n\nPatient: Yeah, that makes sense. I've always been kind of a perfectionist, and I think that's where a lot of those thoughts come from. But it's hard to break out of that mindset.\n\nTherapist: You're right, changing long-held beliefs can be challenging, but it's definitely possible with practice. One way to start shifting those negative core beliefs is to actively look for evidence that contradicts them. For example, when you have the thought \"I'm not good enough,\" try to think of times when you have been successful or received positive feedback. This can help you start to build a more balanced and realistic view of yourself.\n\nPatient: I can try that. It's just hard to think of those examples when I'm feeling really down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. When we're feeling depressed, it can be difficult to access positive memories or see things objectively. That's why it's helpful to write down the evidence against your negative beliefs when you're in a more neutral state of mind. You can create a list of your accomplishments, positive qualities, and supportive people in your life to refer back to when you're struggling with negative thoughts.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I could keep a list on my phone, so I always have it with me.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Having that list easily accessible can be a powerful tool for challenging negative thoughts and beliefs. As you continue to practice these skills, you'll likely find it easier to come up with evidence against your negative thoughts in the moment.\n\nPatient: I hope so. I know it's going to take time, but I'm willing to keep working at it.\n\nTherapist: Your dedication to the therapy process is really admirable, Emilio. Remember that progress isn't always linear \u2013 there will be ups and downs along the way, and that's okay. What matters is that you keep practicing and learning from each experience.",
