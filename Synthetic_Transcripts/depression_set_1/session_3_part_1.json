  "transcript": "Here is part 1 of the CBT assessment session 3 of 3 for Emilio Gomez:\n\nTherapist: Hi Emilio, it's great to see you again. Thank you for sharing that summary from our last session. I'm glad it captured the key points and was helpful for you to review. Before we dive in today, I want to take a moment to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate. Additionally, as an AI, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you are in crisis, it's important to reach out to a qualified professional or emergency service for immediate support. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm not able to directly observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. With all that said, I'm fully committed to working with you to the best of my abilities. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. It's good to know what to expect. I'm looking forward to continuing our work together.\n\nTherapist: Great, I'm looking forward to it as well. Let's start by setting an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review your homework from last time, finalize our conceptualization of your depression, and start setting some specific, measurable goals for your therapy. How does that sound? Is there anything else you'd like to make sure we cover today?",
