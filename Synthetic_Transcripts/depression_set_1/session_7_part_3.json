  "transcript": "Patient: I'm starting to see how challenging my thoughts can be helpful. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment when I'm feeling really down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Emilio. Remembering to use these skills when we're feeling overwhelmed can be challenging. One strategy that can help is to create a \"coping card\" with some key reminders and questions to ask yourself when you're feeling distressed. For example, you might write down something like, \"What evidence do I have for and against this thought?\" or \"Is there another way to look at this situation?\" You can keep this card with you and pull it out when you need a reminder to challenge your thoughts. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. Having a physical reminder could be really helpful, especially when I'm feeling too overwhelmed to think clearly.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find that idea helpful. Another strategy we can use is behavioral activation, which involves intentionally engaging in activities that promote positive emotions and a sense of accomplishment, even when we don't feel motivated to do so. This can help counteract the avoidance and withdrawal that often accompany depression. Last session, we discussed choosing one activity to break down into smaller steps using the timer technique. Were you able to try that over the past week?\n\nPatient: I did try it with cleaning my apartment. I broke it down into smaller tasks and used a timer to focus on one task at a time. It helped me feel less overwhelmed and more productive.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Emilio! Breaking tasks down into smaller, manageable steps can make them feel less daunting and more achievable. It's great that you were able to apply this technique to cleaning your apartment and that it helped you feel more productive. As we continue to practice behavioral activation, you'll likely find it easier to engage in activities that promote positive emotions and a sense of accomplishment, even when you're feeling down. This can help create a positive feedback loop, where engaging in rewarding activities boosts your mood, which in turn makes it easier to engage in more rewarding activities.",
