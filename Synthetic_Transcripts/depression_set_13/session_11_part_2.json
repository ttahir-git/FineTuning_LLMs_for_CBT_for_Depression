  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share an example from my thought records. Last week, I reached out to a support group member, like we had discussed. I sent them a message asking if they wanted to meet up for coffee. They responded saying they were busy and couldn't make it. I immediately started feeling rejected and like I wasn't important to them.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Alex. Let's break this down using the thought record. What emotions did you experience in that moment, and how intense were they?\n\nPatient: I felt really sad and disappointed. I'd say the intensity was around an 8 out of 10. I also felt a bit angry with myself for reaching out in the first place.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why you felt that way. Those are strong emotions. What thoughts went through your mind when you received their response?\n\nPatient: My first thought was, \"They don't really want to spend time with me.\" Then I started thinking, \"I'm not important enough for them to make time for.\" And finally, I ended up at, \"I'm not good enough for anyone to want to be around me.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are really powerful and seem to be closely tied to your core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" Let's examine the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that they don't want to spend time with you or that you're not important to them?\n\nPatient: Well, they said they were busy and couldn't make it. I guess that's the main evidence.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's consider that. Is it possible that they had a genuine conflict or prior commitment that prevented them from meeting up?\n\nPatient: I suppose it's possible. They did say they were busy.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point. Now, what about evidence against these thoughts? Have there been times when this person or others in the support group have shown interest in spending time with you or valuing your presence?\n\nPatient: When I think about it, there have been a few times when people in the group have reached out to me or seemed glad to see me at meetings. And this person did say they appreciated me reaching out, even though they couldn't make it this time.\n\nTherapist: That's really important to consider. It sounds like there is evidence that contradicts the idea that you're not important or that people don't want to be around you. Based on this evidence, how might you reframe or challenge the thoughts you had in that moment?\n\nPatient: I guess I could remind myself that people have shown interest in connecting with me before, and that one instance of someone being busy doesn't mean I'm not good enough or that no one wants to spend time with me.\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative perspective, Alex. It takes into account the evidence against your negative thoughts and provides a more balanced view of the situation. How do you think this reframing would impact the emotions you felt in that moment?\n\nPatient: I think it would help reduce the intensity of the sadness and disappointment. It might also help me feel less angry with myself for reaching out.\n\nTherapist: I agree. Challenging these negative thoughts and finding more balanced alternatives can have a big impact on our emotional state. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the more natural it will become.\n\nPatient: I can see how this could be helpful. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment when I'm feeling really emotional.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alex. It can be challenging to apply these skills when we're in the midst of strong emotions. One strategy that can help is to create a coping card with some key reminders or phrases that challenge your negative thoughts. You can keep this card with you and pull it out when you're feeling overwhelmed by emotions. What do you think about giving that a try?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good idea. I could write down some of the evidence against my negative thoughts and the alternative perspectives we've discussed.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. You can also include reminders of your strengths and positive qualities, or even a list of people you can reach out to for support when you're struggling. The coping card can be a tangible tool to help you challenge negative thoughts and regulate your emotions in difficult moments.",
