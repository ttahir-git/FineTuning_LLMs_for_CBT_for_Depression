  "transcript": "Patient: That sounds good to me. I'm hoping that with more practice, I can start to shift my negative thought patterns and feel more engaged in life.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, practicing these skills regularly is key to making progress. Before we dive into thought records, let's discuss your experience with the homework from our last session. How did you find creating visual reminders for distress tolerance techniques and practicing them when feeling overwhelmed?\n\nPatient: The visual reminders were helpful. I put them up around my apartment, so I see them often. When I start to feel overwhelmed, seeing the reminders helps me remember to pause and try a technique like deep breathing or grounding. It doesn't always work perfectly, but it has helped me feel a bit more in control.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Being able to pause and use a technique, even if it doesn't completely eliminate the overwhelming feelings, is a significant step forward. It's about building that muscle of self-regulation. And having those visual cues in your environment can be really effective in helping you remember to use the skills when you need them most.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I agree. It's just hard sometimes because the negative thoughts can be so loud and persistent. Even when I try to challenge them, they keep coming back.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience. Our negative thoughts can be very stubborn because they often feel so true and familiar. But each time you pause and challenge them, you're weakening their hold on you a little bit more. It's a process of gradually shifting those well-worn thought patterns. Let's look at one of the thought records you completed this week. Can you share an example of a negative thought you struggled with and how you tried to find evidence against it?\n\nPatient: Sure. Earlier this week, I was feeling really down and had the thought, \"I'm never going to get better. I'm always going to feel this way.\" When I tried to find evidence against it, I could only come up with things like, \"Well, I've had some moments where I felt a bit better,\" but it didn't feel very convincing.\n\nTherapist: I understand how that thought can feel so powerful and convincing, especially when you're feeling down. Let's explore this further together. When you have the thought, \"I'm never going to get better,\" what emotions do you feel?\n\nPatient: I feel hopeless, sad, and defeated. It's like this heavy weight on my chest.\n\nTherapist: Those are really painful emotions. And it's understandable how that thought would trigger them. Now, let's look at the evidence you came up with: \"I've had some moments where I felt a bit better.\" How does that evidence make you feel?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel a tiny bit of hope, but it's hard to hold onto.\n\nTherapist: That's okay. Even a tiny bit of hope is significant. Let's see if we can find some more evidence to support that hope. You mentioned that since our last session, you've noticed a slight improvement in your mood. That's evidence that change is possible, even if it's small. What about the fact that you're here in therapy, doing the hard work of challenging these thoughts? What does that say about the possibility of getting better?\n\nPatient: I guess it shows that I'm taking steps to try to get better, even if it's difficult.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Being here, doing this work, is a powerful piece of evidence against the thought that you'll never get better. It shows that you're committed to your healing, even when it's challenging. Every small step you take, every time you practice a skill or challenge a thought, is evidence that change is possible.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's just hard to remember that in the moment when I'm feeling so down.\n\nTherapist: That's why we practice. Each time you challenge a thought, you're building that muscle, making it a little easier to do it the next time. And having those visual reminders can help you remember the skills when you need them most. Let's keep working on building that evidence against the negative thoughts. Can you think of any other times in your life when you've faced a challenge and made it through?",
