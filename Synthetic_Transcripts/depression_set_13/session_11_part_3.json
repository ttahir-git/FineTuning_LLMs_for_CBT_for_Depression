  "transcript": "Patient: I like the idea of the coping card. It seems like it could be a helpful tool for me to use when I'm struggling with negative thoughts and emotions.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find the coping card idea helpful, Alex. It can be a powerful way to remind yourself of the skills and insights you're developing in therapy. Why don't we take a few minutes now to create a draft of your coping card together? We can start by identifying some of the key evidence against your negative core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" What are some experiences or pieces of evidence that challenge this belief?\n\nPatient: Well, I think about the times when I've been able to help others through my work or volunteering. Those experiences make me feel like I have something valuable to offer.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Alex. Your dedication to helping others is a clear strength and evidence of your worth. Let's write that down on your coping card. What else can you think of?\n\nPatient: I guess I could also include reminders of times when people have expressed appreciation for me or my work. Like when a colleague thanked me for my help on a project or when a friend told me they valued our friendship.\n\nTherapist: Those are perfect examples to include on your coping card, Alex. Reminders of positive feedback and appreciation from others can be powerful challenges to negative core beliefs. Let's add those to the card as well.\n\nPatient: Okay, I've got those written down. What else should I include?\n\nTherapist: Another helpful thing to include on your coping card is a list of coping statements or affirmations that you can use to challenge negative thoughts in the moment. These might be phrases like \"I am enough,\" \"I have value,\" or \"I can handle this.\" What are some affirmations or coping statements that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of \"I am enough.\" That feels like a good counter to my negative core belief. I could also use something like \"I have overcome challenges before, and I can do it again.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent coping statements, Alex. They affirm your inherent worth and remind you of your resilience. Let's add those to your coping card as well.\n\nPatient: Okay, I've added those. Is there anything else I should include?\n\nTherapist: One last thing that can be helpful to include on your coping card is a list of people you can reach out to for support when you're struggling. This might include friends, family members, or even crisis hotlines or support groups. Having a list of supportive people readily available can make it easier to reach out when you need help. Who are some people you might include on your list?\n\nPatient: I could include my friend from the support group who I reached out to last week. Even though they couldn't meet up, they did say they appreciated me reaching out. I could also include the number for a crisis hotline, in case I need immediate support.\n\nTherapist: Those are great people to include on your support list, Alex. It's important to have a range of options, from friends and loved ones to professional resources. Let's add those to your coping card.\n\nPatient: Okay, I've got my coping card filled out now. It includes evidence against my negative core belief, coping statements, and a list of supportive people I can reach out to.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Alex. Your coping card looks great. Remember, this is a tool you can use whenever you're struggling with negative thoughts or emotions. Keep it with you and pull it out when you need a reminder of your strengths, your worth, and the support available to you.\n\nPatient: Thank you for helping me create this. I can see how it could be really helpful for me to have on hand.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alex. I'm glad we were able to create this tool together. As we continue in our work together, we can keep adding to and refining your coping card based on the insights and skills you develop.",
