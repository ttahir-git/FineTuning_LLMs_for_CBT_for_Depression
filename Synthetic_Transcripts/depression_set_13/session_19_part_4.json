  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you walking me through how to use my relapse prevention plan in that situation. It makes me feel more prepared for future setbacks.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that was helpful, Alex. Remember, setbacks are a normal part of the process, and they don't erase all the progress you've made. You have the tools and strategies to manage them now.\n\nAs we're nearing the end of our session today, I wanted to check in on how you're feeling right now. What's your current mood, and do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful, actually. It's reassuring to know that I have a plan for dealing with setbacks, and that I'm not alone in this process. I know I still have work to do, but I feel like I'm making progress.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Alex. Hope is such an important part of the healing process, and I'm glad you're feeling more hopeful today. Remember, progress isn't always linear, but every small step counts.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing your relapse prevention strategies, especially in moments when you notice those early warning signs. Try to challenge those negative thoughts using your thought records and coping cards, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll definitely keep practicing those strategies. Thank you for all your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Alex. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, you've made incredible progress, and you have the tools and skills to continue moving forward. I'm really proud of the work you've done.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Reviewed progress made in therapy and key insights; discussed the connection between core beliefs and past experiences; explored how core beliefs have impacted relationships and experiences; practiced applying relapse prevention strategies to a specific situation; reinforced the normalcy of setbacks and the importance of self-compassion.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Review of progress and insights; exploring the impact of core beliefs; practicing relapse prevention strategies; reinforcing self-compassion.
