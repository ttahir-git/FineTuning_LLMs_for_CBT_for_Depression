  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job focusing on the facts and considering alternative perspectives, Alex. These skills take practice, so don't be discouraged if it feels challenging at times. Remember, each small step you take in challenging your negative thoughts is a step towards building a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself.\n\nI'd like to explore how your negative core belief of \"I'm not good enough\" might be impacting your progress. Can you think of a recent situation where this belief influenced your thoughts, feelings, or behaviors?\n\nPatient: One situation that comes to mind is when I was invited to a social gathering by a friend from my support group. My initial reaction was to decline the invitation because I started thinking that I wouldn't fit in or that people wouldn't want to talk to me. I felt anxious and worried that I would say something embarrassing or be judged by others.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Alex. Let's break down how your core belief of \"I'm not good enough\" might have influenced your reaction to the invitation.\n\nFirst, we have the situation: being invited to a social gathering. This triggered an automatic thought, something like, \"I won't fit in, and people won't want to talk to me.\" This thought then led to feelings of anxiety and worry. Is that accurate?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's exactly how it felt. The thought just popped into my head, and before I knew it, I was feeling really anxious about the whole thing.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alex. You've identified the connection between the situation, your automatic thought, and your feelings. Now, let's look at how your core belief might be fueling that automatic thought.\n\nThe thought \"I won't fit in, and people won't want to talk to me\" seems to be stemming from the deeper belief \"I'm not good enough.\" It's like your mind is using this core belief as evidence to support the negative prediction about the social gathering. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: It does make sense. It's like my core belief is coloring how I interpret the situation, even before I've given it a chance.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Alex. Our core beliefs act like lenses through which we view the world, ourselves, and others. They can distort our perceptions and lead to automatic thoughts that might not be entirely accurate.\n\nTo start reframing your core belief, we can use a similar process to what we did with your thought records. We'll look for evidence that supports a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself. Can you think of a time when you felt like you did fit in or when people seemed to enjoy talking to you?\n\nPatient: Well, there was a time at my support group when we did a group activity, and I ended up having a really good conversation with a couple of people. We laughed and shared some common experiences. I felt like I belonged in that moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example, Alex. It shows that there are times when you do feel a sense of belonging and connection with others. This is an important piece of evidence against your core belief \"I'm not good enough.\"\n\nAs you continue to challenge your negative thoughts and core beliefs, remember to look for evidence that supports a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself. It might be helpful to keep a \"positive data log\" where you write down moments like the one you just described, as reminders of your worth and ability to connect with others.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of a positive data log. It might help me see that there are more moments of connection than I realize.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Alex. A positive data log can be a powerful tool in building a more balanced and realistic view of yourself. It's all about gathering evidence to support new, more adaptive beliefs.\n\nAs we continue to work on reframing your core belief, remember that it's a process, and it takes time. Be patient and compassionate with yourself, and celebrate each small step you take in challenging your negative thoughts and beliefs.\n\nI'd like to hear more about your experience at the support group meeting you attended. How did it feel to be there, and what did you take away from the experience?",
