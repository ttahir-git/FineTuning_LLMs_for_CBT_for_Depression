  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm committed to helping you to the best of my abilities. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm doing alright today, thanks for asking. I've been trying to use the coping cards and strategies we discussed last session, and I think it's helping a bit. I still have moments where I struggle with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, but I'm trying to catch them early and challenge them.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been using the coping cards and strategies, and that they're providing some help. It's normal to still experience negative thoughts and feelings at times, but the fact that you're catching them early and challenging them is a significant step forward. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes in your mood, behaviors, or experiences?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to engage in more meaningful activities, like we talked about. I went for a walk in the park the other day, and I noticed that I felt a bit more energized afterwards. But there are still times when I feel overwhelmed by the negative thoughts, and it's hard to motivate myself to do anything. I guess I'm making progress, but it feels slow.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been engaging in meaningful activities like walking in the park, and that you noticed a positive impact on your energy levels. Progress can feel slow at times, but every small step counts. Remember, it's not about perfection, but rather about building momentum and consistently challenging those negative thoughts and behaviors. You're doing a great job, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nFor today's session, I thought we could start by reviewing your reflections on the progress you've made in therapy so far, and discuss any key insights or \"aha moments\" you've had. We can also continue identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and core beliefs, and further explore the connection between your core beliefs and past experiences or family dynamics. Additionally, we can discuss your progress towards your therapy goals and adjust them as needed. What do you think about that plan? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?",
