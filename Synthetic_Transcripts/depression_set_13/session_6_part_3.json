  "transcript": "Patient: When I think about challenges I've faced in the past, I remember when I first started working in non-profits. It was really overwhelming at first, and I didn't think I could handle it. But over time, I learned the skills I needed and found my footing.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. It shows that even when things feel overwhelming and impossible at first, you have the ability to learn, grow, and adapt. Those same skills and strengths are still within you now, even if it doesn't always feel that way. Let's add that to our evidence against the thought that you'll never get better.\n\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense. I guess I have faced challenges before and come out the other side.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And each time you do that, you're building evidence that you have the strength and resilience to face difficult times. Now, let's look at how this thought, \"I'm never going to get better,\" might be impacting your behavior. When you have that thought, what do you feel like doing?\n\nPatient: I feel like giving up, like there's no point in trying. I just want to stay in bed and avoid everything.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common response to that kind of thought. When we believe that change isn't possible, it's natural to feel like giving up and avoiding things. But what happens when you do that?\n\nPatient: I end up feeling worse, because I'm not doing anything to help myself. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of feeling bad and then avoiding things, which makes me feel even worse.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Avoidance might provide some short-term relief, but in the long run, it tends to make us feel worse and keeps us stuck. This is where behavioral activation can be really helpful. The idea is to gradually start engaging in activities that give you a sense of pleasure or accomplishment, even if you don't feel like it at first. Over time, this can help break that cycle of avoidance and improve your mood. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: It makes sense. I know that when I do manage to do something, even if it's small, I usually feel a little better afterwards. It's just hard to get started.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, getting started is often the hardest part. That's why we start small and build up gradually. Let's look at your list of meaningful activities and see if we can find something small you could try in the next week. Remember, the goal isn't to feel great right away, but just to take a step in that direction.",
