  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying the deep breathing and grounding exercises, but I haven't been very consistent with them. When I do remember to use them, they help a little bit, but it's hard to make myself do them when I'm feeling really overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: It's good that you've been trying the techniques, even if it hasn't been as consistent as you'd like. Building new habits takes time and practice. Let's explore what might be getting in the way of using these techniques when you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you think of a specific situation where you felt overwhelmed but didn't use the techniques?\n\nPatient: Yeah, just the other day, I got a call from my sister. She was going on about how I need to get out more and do something with my life. I started feeling really anxious and upset, but I didn't even think to use the breathing exercises until hours later.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Alex. Let's break this down a bit. What thoughts were going through your mind during and after the call with your sister?\n\nPatient: I was thinking that she's right, I'm just wasting my life away. I haven't accomplished anything, and I'm never going to get better. I felt so hopeless and ashamed.\n\nTherapist: Those are some really heavy thoughts, and it makes sense that you felt overwhelmed. When we're in the midst of strong emotions, it can be hard to remember to use our coping skills. One thing that might help is to create a visual reminder for yourself. This could be a note on your fridge, a screensaver on your phone, or even a small object you carry with you. The idea is to have something that catches your attention and reminds you to pause and use your distress tolerance skills when you're feeling overwhelmed. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. Maybe I could put a sticky note on my phone, since I always have it with me. But what if I still don't feel like doing the exercises, even with the reminder?\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern. Sometimes, even with a reminder, it can be hard to motivate ourselves to use coping skills. One strategy is to make the first step as small and easy as possible. For example, instead of trying to do a full 5-minute breathing exercise, you could commit to just taking three deep breaths. Once you've done that, you might find it easier to continue with the full exercise. The key is to start with something that feels doable, even when your motivation is low.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can try that. I think I'm also worried that the exercises won't work, and then I'll just feel worse.\n\nTherapist: I understand that fear. It's important to remember that these techniques aren't meant to get rid of all negative emotions completely. They're tools to help manage and cope with difficult feelings, not to eliminate them entirely. It's okay if the exercises don't take away all of your distress. The goal is to help you ride out the wave of emotion without getting overwhelmed or doing something impulsive that might make things worse in the long run.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself to feel better right away, and that's not really realistic.\n\nTherapist: You're right, putting pressure on yourself to feel better immediately can actually add to your distress. Recovery is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Remember to practice self-compassion and give yourself credit for the small victories along the way, like reaching out for support or trying a new coping skill.\n\nPatient: Thanks, I'll try to keep that in mind. Can we talk more about the thought records now? I'm still having trouble with those.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, let's dive into the thought records. Can you walk me through what's been challenging about using them?",
