  "transcript": "Patient: I have a question about the thought records. What if I'm not sure if a thought is negative or distorted? Sometimes I feel like my thoughts are justified, even if they're not positive.\n\nTherapist: That's a great question, Alex. It's not always easy to identify negative or distorted thoughts, especially when they feel true or justified. One way to approach this is to ask yourself, \"Is this thought helpful? Is it moving me closer to my goals and values, or is it holding me back?\" Even if a thought feels true, if it's not serving you, it might be worth examining further.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess even if a thought feels true, if it's making me feel worse or keeping me stuck, it's probably not helpful.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Alex. It's about finding a balance between acknowledging your thoughts and feelings, and not letting them control you. Another helpful question to ask yourself is, \"Would I say this to a good friend in a similar situation?\" Often, we're much harder on ourselves than we would be on others.\n\nPatient: That's definitely true for me. I'm much more critical of myself than I am of my friends or family.\n\nTherapist: Many people find that to be the case, Alex. By treating yourself with the same compassion and understanding you would offer a loved one, you can start to shift those negative thought patterns. This is something we can continue to work on together in our sessions.",
