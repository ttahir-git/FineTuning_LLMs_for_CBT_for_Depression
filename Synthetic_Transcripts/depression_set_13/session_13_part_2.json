  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share some examples of negative thoughts I've been working on. One that keeps coming up is \"I'm not good enough to make meaningful connections with others.\" When I try to challenge this thought, I often feel like I'm just fooling myself or being too easy on myself. It's hard to believe the evidence against the thought, even when I write it down.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alex. It's common to feel a sense of doubt or disbelief when challenging long-held negative thoughts, especially those related to core beliefs about ourselves. The fact that you're recognizing this difficulty is an important step in itself.\n\nWhen you find it hard to believe the evidence against your negative thought, it can be helpful to take a step back and examine the evidence more objectively. Let's look at one of the pieces of evidence you wrote down against the thought \"I'm not good enough to make meaningful connections with others.\" Can you share one with me?\n\nPatient: Well, one piece of evidence I wrote down is that I have made meaningful connections in the past, like with my coworkers at my previous job. But when I think about that, I often dismiss it by telling myself that those connections weren't that meaningful or that my coworkers just felt sorry for me.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Alex. What you're describing is a common cognitive distortion called \"disqualifying the positive,\" where we dismiss or minimize positive experiences or evidence that contradicts our negative beliefs.\n\nOne way to counter this distortion is to consciously focus on the facts of the situation, rather than the interpretations or assumptions we might be adding to it. In this case, the fact is that you did make connections with your coworkers, regardless of how you might judge their depth or your coworkers' motivations. Can you try to reframe this evidence by focusing on the facts, without adding any negative interpretations?\n\nPatient: I guess if I just focus on the facts, I would say that I had several coworkers who I regularly ate lunch with, shared personal stories with, and supported each other through work challenges. We stayed in touch for a while after I retired, though I haven't reached out much recently.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of focusing on the facts, Alex. By doing so, you're acknowledging the reality of the connections you made, without dismissing them based on assumptions or judgments.\n\nAnother way to strengthen the evidence against your negative thought is to consider alternative perspectives. How do you think your coworkers would describe their connection with you? What might they say if they knew you were questioning the meaningfulness of your relationships?\n\nPatient: I imagine they would be surprised that I'm questioning our connections. They might remind me of specific moments we shared or the support we gave each other. They might say that they valued our friendship and missed our interactions.\n\nTherapist: That's a valuable perspective to consider, Alex. By putting yourself in your coworkers' shoes, you can start to see your connections from a different angle and recognize the value they held for others, not just yourself.\n\nAs you continue to practice challenging your negative thoughts, try to focus on the facts of the situation and consider alternative perspectives. This can help you build a more balanced and realistic view of yourself and your relationships.",
