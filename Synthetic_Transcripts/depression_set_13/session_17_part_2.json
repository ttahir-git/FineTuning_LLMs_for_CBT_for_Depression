  "transcript": "Patient: I'm glad we have a plan for today's session. I really want to understand why I struggle with motivation and how my past experiences might be influencing my negative core beliefs.\n\nTherapist: That's a great place to start, Alex. Let's begin by reviewing the homework you completed since our last session. You mentioned that you were able to complete a few thought records and engage in some meaningful activities. Can you share your experiences with these tasks and what made it challenging to find motivation at times?\n\nPatient: Well, I did complete a couple of thought records, but I found it difficult to challenge my negative thoughts. I could identify them, but when it came to finding evidence against them, I felt stuck. As for the meaningful activities, I went for a walk in the park and attended a virtual support group meeting, but I didn't feel a strong sense of accomplishment or enjoyment from them.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing this, Alex. It's common to encounter difficulties when challenging long-standing negative thought patterns. The fact that you were able to identify your negative thoughts is an important first step. Regarding the meaningful activities, it's understandable that you didn't feel a strong sense of accomplishment or enjoyment right away. Sometimes, it takes time and consistent effort to start experiencing the benefits of engaging in these activities. Can you tell me more about what made it challenging to find evidence against your negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: I think it's because I've been thinking this way for so long that it feels like the truth. When I try to come up with evidence against my negative thoughts, my mind goes blank, or I dismiss any positive aspects as flukes or exceptions to the rule.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alex. Our negative core beliefs can be deeply ingrained and feel like absolute truths, making it challenging to find evidence against them. One strategy we can use is to approach the situation like a scientist or detective, examining the evidence objectively and considering alternative perspectives. Let's practice this together with one of the thought records you completed. Can you share an example of a negative thought you struggled to challenge?",
