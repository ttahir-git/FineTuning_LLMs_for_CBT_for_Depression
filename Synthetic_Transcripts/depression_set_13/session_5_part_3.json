  "transcript": "Patient: When I try to do the thought records, I have trouble coming up with evidence against my negative thoughts. I know I'm supposed to challenge them, but I get stuck.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Alex. When we're feeling depressed, it can be difficult to see things from a different perspective. One strategy is to imagine what you might say to a friend who was having similar thoughts. We're often kinder and more objective when it comes to other people. For example, if your friend said, \"I'm never going to get better,\" what might you say to them?\n\nPatient: I guess I would remind them that recovery takes time, and they're doing the best they can. And I might point out any small improvements they've made, even if they don't feel like much.\n\nTherapist: That's a great way to approach it. You can use that same kindness and objectivity when challenging your own thoughts. Another strategy is to look for small pieces of evidence, even if they don't feel significant at first. For example, the fact that you're showing up for therapy and doing your best to engage in the process is evidence that you're taking steps towards getting better, even if it doesn't feel like it in the moment.\n\nPatient: I hadn't thought about it that way. I guess I have been making some progress, even if it's small.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. It's important to give yourself credit for the small victories along the way. Another thing to keep in mind is that the goal of thought records isn't to convince yourself that everything is fine or to force yourself to think positively. It's about finding a more balanced perspective and recognizing that there may be other ways to look at a situation.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I think I've been putting too much pressure on myself to feel better right away, and that's not realistic.\n\nTherapist: You're right, putting pressure on yourself to feel better immediately can actually add to your distress. Recovery is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Remember to practice self-compassion and give yourself credit for the small victories along the way, like reaching out for support or trying a new coping skill.\n\nPatient: Thanks, I'll try to keep that in mind. Can we practice a thought record together now? I think it would be helpful to have some guidance.\n\nTherapist: Of course, let's walk through a thought record together. Can you think of a specific situation that triggered some strong emotions for you recently?\n\nPatient: Yeah, just the other day, I got a call from my sister. She was going on about how I need to get out more and do something with my life. I started feeling really anxious and upset.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's use that situation for our thought record. What emotions did you notice during and after the call with your sister?\n\nPatient: I felt really anxious, sad, and ashamed. I'd say the anxiety was at an 8 out of 10, the sadness was around a 7, and the shame was at a 9.\n\nTherapist: Those are some really intense emotions. Let's identify the thoughts that were going through your mind during and after the call. What were you saying to yourself?\n\nPatient: I was thinking that she's right, I'm just wasting my life away. I haven't accomplished anything, and I'm never going to get better.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are really heavy and critical. Let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts now. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're wasting your life away and will never get better?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm not working right now, and I spend a lot of time alone. I haven't been able to do many of the things I used to enjoy, and I feel like I'm just stuck.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, those are some real challenges you're facing. Now let's look for evidence against those thoughts. What are some things that don't support the idea that you're wasting your life away and will never get better?\n\nPatient: I guess the fact that I'm coming to therapy and trying to work on my mental health is evidence that I'm not giving up. And even though I'm not working, I have been volunteering occasionally, which is something meaningful.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of evidence against the negative thoughts. Even though the progress might feel small, the fact that you're taking steps to improve your mental health and engage in meaningful activities is significant. Now, based on the evidence for and against the negative thoughts, what might be a more balanced way to look at the situation?",
