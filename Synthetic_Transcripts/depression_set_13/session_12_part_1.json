  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that while I have access to the information you've provided me, I am an AI and have some limitations. I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate could be inaccurate. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. And since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues.\n\nWith that said, I'm fully committed to working with you and supporting your progress in therapy. How have you been since our last session? Can you share with me how your mood has been and if there have been any significant changes or experiences?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations as an AI. I understand and appreciate your commitment to supporting me in therapy. Since our last session, my mood has been relatively stable, but I've noticed that I've been feeling more isolated and disconnected from others. I've been struggling to motivate myself to reach out and engage in social activities, even though I know it's important for my well-being.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Alex. Feeling isolated and disconnected can be challenging, especially when it's difficult to find the motivation to reach out. Let's make sure to discuss this further during our session today. How about we set an agenda for our time together? I'd like to review your homework and progress with the thought records, coping card, and social connection goal we set last time. We can also continue identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and core beliefs related to isolation and disconnection. Additionally, we can explore strategies to help you increase your engagement in social activities. Does this sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'd also like to discuss some of the challenges I've been facing with using the coping card when I'm feeling overwhelmed by emotions. Sometimes, it's hard for me to remember to use it in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss the challenges you've been facing with using the coping card. It's a great opportunity for us to problem-solve together and find ways to make it more accessible and helpful for you. Let's start by reviewing your homework and progress since our last session. Can you share with me how it's been going with using the thought records and focusing on challenging negative thoughts related to isolation and disconnection?",
