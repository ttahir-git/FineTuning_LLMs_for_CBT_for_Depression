  "transcript": "Patient: I've been feeling a mix of emotions lately. On one hand, I'm relieved and grateful that my wife's health is stable. But on the other hand, I find myself constantly worrying about the future and what might happen if her cancer comes back. It's like I'm always on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nTherapist: That's a difficult position to be in, Arjun. It's understandable to feel relief and gratitude for your wife's current health, but it's also common for fears about the future to creep in. This kind of uncertainty can be really challenging to sit with. \n\nLet's explore these emotions a bit further. When you find yourself worrying about the future, what thoughts tend to come up for you? And how do those thoughts impact your feelings and behaviors?\n\nPatient: I often think to myself, \"What if her cancer comes back? What if she doesn't make it this time?\" And then I start to feel guilty for even thinking that way, like I'm tempting fate somehow. It's like a vicious cycle - the more I worry, the more I feel guilty, and the more I feel guilty, the more I worry.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Arjun. You've identified a cycle of thoughts and feelings that are feeding into each other and creating a lot of distress for you. This is actually a great opportunity to practice some of the CBT skills we've been working on.\n\nLet's start by examining those thoughts a bit more closely. When you think, \"What if her cancer comes back?\" and \"What if she doesn't make it this time?\" what evidence do you have to support or refute those thoughts?\n\nPatient: Well, I know that statistically, her chances of the cancer coming back are relatively low. And even if it did come back, we caught it early the first time, so there's a good chance we could catch it early again. But it's hard to hold onto that logic when I'm in the midst of the worry.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Arjun. You've identified some important evidence that suggests your worst fears may not be as likely as they feel in the moment. That's a really valuable perspective to hold onto.\n\nAt the same time, you're right that it can be hard to access that logic when you're feeling really anxious or worried. That's where some of the coping strategies we've talked about can come in handy.\n\nWhat are some of the tools in your coping kit that you think might be helpful in moments like these?\n\nPatient: I think the 5-5-5 technique could be helpful - focusing on my senses to ground myself in the present moment. And maybe looking at my coping cards with reminders of more balanced thoughts and beliefs.\n\nTherapist: Those are both great ideas, Arjun. The 5-5-5 technique can be really effective for bringing you back to the present when your mind is spinning out with worries about the future. And your coping cards can help remind you of the more balanced perspective we just talked about.\n\nAnother tool that might be helpful is a thought record. This is a way of slowing down and examining your thoughts more closely, looking at the evidence for and against them, and coming up with a more balanced thought. Would you be willing to try that with me now?",
