  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in exploring and reframing your core beliefs. Challenging long-held beliefs is not easy, and you've shown a lot of courage and dedication in this process.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a challenging journey, but I feel like I'm starting to make some real progress. I know there's still a lot of work to do, but I'm committed to keeping at it.\n\nTherapist: Your commitment to your growth and well-being is admirable. Remember, therapy is a process, and change takes time. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\nBefore we end today's session, let's do a quick check-in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also hopeful. Talking about my core beliefs and making a plan to reframe them feels like a big step forward. I know it won't be easy, but I'm ready to put in the work.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling hopeful, even if you're also tired. Therapy can be emotionally taxing, so make sure to take some time to rest and recharge after our session.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue working on your positive data log, recording evidence that supports your new, more balanced beliefs about your worth. Also, try to practice self-compassion when you notice yourself falling into old patterns of thinking. Finally, start putting together your coping kit for managing overwhelming emotions, and try to use it when you feel distressed.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll make sure to set aside some time each day to work on my homework and practice the techniques we've discussed.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. Remember, consistency is key when it comes to making lasting changes. If you have any questions or concerns during the week, feel free to bring them up at our next session.\n\nSpeaking of our next session, I'd like to continue our work on reframing core beliefs and exploring any new insights or challenges that come up for you. We can also check in on your progress with the coping kit and self-compassion practices.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I'm looking forward to continuing this work together.\n\nTherapist: So am I. You're doing great work, Dr. Patel, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed patient's experiences with practicing cognitive restructuring and distress tolerance techniques since the last session\n  -
