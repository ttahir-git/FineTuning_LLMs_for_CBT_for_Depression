  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned setting small goals related to choir and other hobbies. What are some specific goals you'd like to set for yourself in the coming week?\n\nPatient: For choir, I think a good goal would be to attend the next rehearsal and try to focus on enjoying the experience rather than worrying about making mistakes. For my other hobbies, like playing board games with my family, I could set a goal to initiate a game night once this week.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like great, achievable goals! Attending the next choir rehearsal and focusing on enjoyment is an excellent way to continue challenging perfectionistic thoughts and engaging in an activity that brings you joy. And initiating a game night with your family is a wonderful way to strengthen your connections and practice behavioral activation. Let's discuss how you can use the techniques we've been working on to support these goals.\n\nPatient: That would be really helpful. I know I'll probably have some negative thoughts come up, so having a plan for how to deal with them would be great.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! When you're at choir rehearsal, and you notice a negative thought popping up, try to catch it and challenge it in the moment using the cognitive restructuring skills we've practiced. Remind yourself of the alternative thoughts we discussed earlier, like \"everyone makes mistakes\" and \"one mistake doesn't define my whole ability.\" You can even write these down on a small card to keep with you as a reminder.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. Having a physical reminder could help me stay focused on challenging those negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Definitely! And when you're playing board games with your family, try to focus on the present moment and the enjoyment you're experiencing rather than worrying about the outcome. If you notice yourself getting caught up in perfectionistic thoughts, take a deep breath and gently redirect your attention back to the game and the people around you.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's easy for me to get caught up in wanting to win or do everything perfectly, but I know that's not really the point of playing games with my family.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right. The goal is to enjoy the experience and connect with your loved ones. Remember, perfectionism can rob us of the joy in the present moment. By focusing on the process rather than the outcome, you can start to shift your mindset and find more fulfillment in these activities.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'm looking forward to putting these goals into action and seeing how it goes.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Arjun! I'm excited for you to take these steps towards engaging in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there may be setbacks along the way. The important thing is to keep practicing these skills and be patient with yourself.",
