  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you back for session 3. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm feeling a bit low today, to be honest. I've been struggling with negative thoughts and finding the energy to engage in activities I once enjoyed.\n\nTherapist: I'm sorry to hear that you've been feeling low, Arjun. It takes courage to share that, and I'm here to support you through these challenges. Before we continue, let's set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review your homework from the previous session, finalize the CBT conceptualization of your depression, and begin setting specific, measurable goals for your therapy. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think setting goals will be helpful in giving me some direction.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your homework. Were you able to continue monitoring your thoughts and recording them in the thought record?\n\nPatient: Yes, I did my best to keep track of my thoughts and identify any cognitive distortions. It wasn't easy, but I tried to be consistent.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Arjun. Consistency is key, and I appreciate the effort you put into this. Can you share an example of a thought you recorded and any cognitive distortions you identified?\n\nPatient: Sure. One thought I had was, \"I'm not doing enough to support my family.\" I think this might be an example of \"should\" statements and possibly all-or-nothing thinking.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Arjun. Those are great examples of cognitive distortions. \"Should\" statements can create unrealistic expectations for ourselves, and all-or-nothing thinking can make us feel like we're failing if we're not perfect. Let's explore this thought further. What evidence do you have that supports or refutes this thought?",
