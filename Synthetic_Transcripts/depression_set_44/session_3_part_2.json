  "transcript": "Patient: When I think about the evidence, I can see that I'm doing a lot to support my family. I help with household chores, I'm always there to listen when they need me, and I try to be emotionally supportive. But I still feel like it's not enough.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're able to recognize the ways in which you're supporting your family, Arjun. It's common for people to discount the positive things they do and focus on what they perceive as shortcomings. This is another cognitive distortion called \"disqualifying the positive.\" Let's try to challenge this thought further. What would you say to a friend who expressed a similar thought?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that they're being too hard on themselves and that they should give themselves credit for the things they are doing.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Arjun. It's often easier to show compassion to others than to ourselves. Part of our work together will be helping you develop that same self-compassion. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about setting specific, measurable goals for your therapy. You mentioned earlier that you'd like to find a sense of purpose and meaning in retirement. Can you tell me more about what that would look like for you?\n\nPatient: I think it would involve finding activities that challenge me intellectually and allow me to feel like I'm making a difference in some way. I used to get that from my career, but now I'm not sure where to find it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great starting point, Arjun. Let's break that down into smaller, more specific goals. For example, one goal could be to identify one or two activities that align with your values and interests and commit to engaging in them regularly. Another goal could be to develop a daily routine that includes time for intellectual stimulation and meaningful engagement. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I think having specific goals will help me stay focused and motivated.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. We'll work together to refine these goals and create a plan for achieving them. As we continue with therapy, we'll be using various CBT techniques to help you challenge negative thoughts, develop self-compassion, and engage in activities that bring you a sense of purpose. One technique we'll be using is called behavioral activation, which involves scheduling enjoyable and meaningful activities into your daily routine. Another technique is cognitive restructuring, which we've already started with your thought records. These techniques will help you build the skills you need to manage your depression and create a more fulfilling life. Do you have any questions about the techniques we'll be using?\n\nPatient: No, I think I understand the basic idea. I'm looking forward to learning more and putting these techniques into practice.",
