  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job applying cognitive restructuring to manage overwhelming emotions in both the piano situation and the lunch with colleagues. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to apply it in the moment when you're feeling overwhelmed. I'd like to introduce another technique that can be helpful in managing negative thoughts and emotions, called positive self-talk.\n\nPatient: Positive self-talk? That sounds interesting. How does it work?\n\nTherapist: Positive self-talk involves consciously choosing to focus on positive, encouraging thoughts rather than negative, self-critical ones. It's like having an inner coach who provides support and motivation. For example, instead of thinking, \"I'll never be able to play the piano like I used to,\" you could tell yourself, \"I'm making progress every day, and with practice, I can improve my skills.\"\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's like being my own cheerleader.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Positive self-talk can help shift your focus away from negative thoughts and emotions and toward more constructive, empowering ones. It's a skill that takes practice, but over time, it can become a habit that helps you maintain a more positive outlook.\n\nPatient: I'm definitely willing to give it a try. It seems like it could be really helpful.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're open to trying it. Why don't we practice a few examples together now? Let's start with a situation where you might normally have negative thoughts. What's a common scenario where you find yourself being self-critical?\n\nPatient: Well, I often get down on myself when I'm working on a project around the house and it's not going as smoothly as I'd like.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. What might you typically think in that situation?\n\nPatient: I might think something like, \"I'm so inept. I can't even fix a simple leaky faucet without making a mess of it.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, now let's come up with a positive self-talk statement to counter that negative thought. What could you tell yourself instead?\n\nPatient: I could say, \"I'm learning as I go, and every mistake is an opportunity to improve my skills. I'm capable of figuring this out.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent example of positive self-talk! It acknowledges the challenge while also focusing on your ability to learn and grow. Let's try another one. What's another situation where you might be self-critical?\n\nPatient: I sometimes get frustrated with myself when I'm trying to learn a new piece on the piano and I keep making the same mistake over and over.\n\nTherapist: What might you normally think in that situation?\n\nPatient: I might think, \"I'm so stupid. I'll never get this right.\"\n\nTherapist: Now, what could you tell yourself using positive self-talk?\n\nPatient: I could say, \"Mistakes are a natural part of the learning process. With patience and persistence, I'll eventually master this piece.\"\n\nTherapist: That's another great example! You're acknowledging the challenge while also focusing on your ability to persevere and improve. As you continue to practice positive self-talk, you'll likely find it becomes more natural and automatic over time.\n\nPatient: I can see how this could be really helpful in shifting my mindset and managing negative emotions.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Positive self-talk is a powerful tool for building resilience and maintaining a more optimistic outlook. I'd like to suggest incorporating it into your homework for this week, along with continuing to practice the other techniques we've discussed, like cognitive restructuring and distress tolerance.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. What specifically would you like me to do for homework?\n\nTherapist: For your homework this week, I'd like you to:\n\n1. Continue practicing cognitive restructuring using thought records. Aim to complete at least one thought record per day, focusing on situations where you experience overwhelming emotions.\n\n2. Practice positive self-talk in situations where you normally find yourself being self-critical. Try to consciously reframe negative thoughts into more constructive, empowering ones.\n\n3. Continue practicing distress tolerance techniques, such as deep breathing and grounding exercises, when you feel overwhelmed.\n\n4. Schedule at least one social activity or engage in one hobby that you enjoy, and use the techniques we've discussed to manage any negative thoughts or emotions that arise.\n\nPatient: That all sounds manageable. I'll do my best to practice these techniques throughout the week.\n\nTherapist: I'm confident that with practice, you'll continue to see improvements in your ability to manage overwhelming emotions and maintain a more positive outlook. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay if you have setbacks along the way. The important thing is to keep practicing and not give up.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the encouragement. I feel like I'm making progress, even if it's slow at times.\n\nTherapist: You're doing great, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Before we wrap up, how are you feeling now?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling more hopeful and empowered. I have some new tools to try, and I'm looking forward to seeing how they work for me.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns between now and our next session, don't hesitate to reach out. We can always schedule an extra session if needed.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I'll see you next week.\n\nTherapist: I look forward to it.
