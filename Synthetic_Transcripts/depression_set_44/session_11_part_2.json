  "transcript": "Patient: I'm glad we're focusing on the choir rehearsal and behavioral activation today. I feel like those are the areas where I need the most support right now.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Arjun. Let's dive deeper into your experience at the choir rehearsal. You mentioned earlier that you caught yourself engaging in mind reading and labeling after making a mistake. Can you tell me more about the emotions you experienced in that moment?\n\nPatient: I felt embarrassed and frustrated with myself. I also felt a bit disconnected from the group, like I didn't belong there anymore.\n\nTherapist: Those emotions are completely understandable, especially given the courage it took for you to return to the choir after some time away. Let's explore the thoughts that led to those feelings. When you made the mistake, what was the first thought that went through your mind?\n\nPatient: My first thought was, \"I'm ruining this for everyone. They probably think I'm not good enough to be here anymore.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Arjun. I want to point out a couple of cognitive distortions in that thought. First, you engaged in mind reading by assuming you knew what the other choir members were thinking. Second, you labeled yourself as \"not good enough\" based on one mistake. Let's challenge these distortions. What evidence do you have that you were ruining the rehearsal for everyone?\n\nPatient: Well, like I said before, no one actually said anything negative to me. In fact, people seemed happy to have me back. So, I guess I don't have any real evidence that I was ruining it for everyone.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! It's important to look for concrete evidence when challenging negative thoughts. Now, let's address the labeling. Does making one mistake really mean you're not good enough to be in the choir?\n\nPatient: Logically, I know that everyone makes mistakes and that one mistake doesn't define my whole ability. But in the moment, it's hard to remember that.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Arjun. It's common for us to have these irrational thoughts, even when we know they're not entirely true. The key is to catch them and challenge them, just like you're doing now. Let's practice generating an alternative thought for this situation. What could you tell yourself next time you make a mistake during rehearsal?\n\nPatient: I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that one mistake doesn't negate all my hard work and talent. I could also tell myself that the choir members are likely happy to have me back and aren't judging me as harshly as I think they are.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent alternative thoughts! By challenging the negative thoughts and replacing them with more balanced, realistic ones, you can start to shift your emotional response. Remember, this takes practice, so be patient with yourself as you work on this skill.\n\nPatient: I appreciate the reminder to be patient with myself. I do tend to expect perfection from myself, which I know isn't realistic.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, and it ties into our discussion about behavioral activation. Perfectionism can sometimes hold us back from engaging in activities we enjoy because we fear we won't meet our own high standards. How do you think perfectionism has influenced your engagement with hobbies and social activities?\n\nPatient: I think my perfectionism has made it harder for me to enjoy things because I'm always worried about making mistakes or not being good enough. It's led me to avoid certain situations or give up on things when I don't meet my own expectations.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience for many people who struggle with perfectionism. The good news is that we can work on challenging those perfectionistic thoughts and setting more realistic, achievable goals for ourselves. One way to do this is through behavioral activation. By gradually engaging in activities that bring us joy or a sense of accomplishment, we can start to build momentum and counteract the negative impact of perfectionism. What do you think about continuing to set small, achievable goals related to choir and other hobbies?\n\nPatient: I think that's a good idea. Setting small goals feels less overwhelming than trying to do everything perfectly all at once.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! And as you accomplish those small goals, you'll start to build confidence and momentum. Remember, the goal isn't perfection; it's progress and engagement. Let's brainstorm some small goals you can set for yourself related to choir and other hobbies.",
