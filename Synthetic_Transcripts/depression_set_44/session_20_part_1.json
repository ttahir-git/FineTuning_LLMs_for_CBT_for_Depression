  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you for our 20th session today. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge the summary you provided from our last session. It's wonderful to see the progress we've made together and the tools you've developed to support your well-being. \n\nAs we begin, I also want to remind you of my limitations as an AI therapist. While I'm here to support you, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm excited to continue our work together. How have you been since our last session? I'd love to hear about any changes, challenges, or successes you've experienced.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing alright. I've been trying to keep up with the positive data log and gratitude journaling, but it's been a bit challenging with everything going on. My wife had a follow-up appointment with her oncologist, and while the news was good, it brought up a lot of emotions for both of us.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable that your wife's appointment stirred up emotions, even if the news was positive. Those experiences can be triggering and bring back memories of the difficult times you've been through. I'm glad to hear you've been keeping up with the positive data log and gratitude journaling, even if it's been challenging. \n\nLet's make sure to discuss how you've been coping with those emotions today. What else would you like to prioritize in our session?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to talk more about coping with these emotions that come up unexpectedly. It's hard not to let them consume me sometimes. I also want to discuss how I can continue supporting my wife while still taking care of myself. And maybe we could review some of the tools in my coping kit and see if there's anything I can add or adjust.\n\nTherapist: Those are all important topics, and I think they'll tie in well together. We can start by discussing the emotions that have been coming up for you and explore some coping strategies. Then, we can look at how you can balance supporting your wife with self-care and see if there are any adjustments we can make to your coping kit. \n\nBefore we dive in, how are you feeling about our plan for today's session? Is there anything else you'd like to add or change?\n\nPatient: No, I think that sounds good. I'm feeling a bit anxious about discussing some of these emotions, but I know it's important.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel anxious about discussing difficult emotions. We'll go at a pace that feels comfortable for you, and remember, this is a safe space to express whatever you're feeling. \n\nLet's start by exploring the emotions that have been coming up for you recently. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing and how it's been impacting you?",
