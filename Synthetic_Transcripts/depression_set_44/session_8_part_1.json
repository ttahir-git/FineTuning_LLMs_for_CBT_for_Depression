  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you again for session 8. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like self-compassion and cognitive restructuring. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some improvements in my mood and overall well-being. I scheduled a social activity with a friend from my choir group, which went better than I expected. However, I still struggle with overwhelming emotions and reconnecting with some of my hobbies.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and have noticed some improvements. Scheduling a social activity is a great step forward, and it's encouraging that it went better than expected. It's also understandable that you're still facing challenges with overwhelming emotions and reconnecting with hobbies. We can definitely explore these areas further today. Before we do, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing overwhelming emotions and discussing strategies for reconnecting with my hobbies. I'm also interested in learning more about problem-solving techniques and positive self-talk, as you mentioned in the plan for this session.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. We can start by discussing your experiences with overwhelming emotions since our last session and explore some additional distress tolerance techniques. Then, we can move on to strategies for reconnecting with your hobbies and introduce problem-solving techniques and positive self-talk. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds perfect. I'm ready to get started.",
