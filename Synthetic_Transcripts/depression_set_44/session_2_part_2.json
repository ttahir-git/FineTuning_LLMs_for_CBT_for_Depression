  "transcript": "Patient: I think I understand the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. But I'm not sure how to change these negative thought patterns.\n\nTherapist: That's a great question, Arjun. In CBT, we work on identifying and challenging cognitive distortions, which are inaccurate or irrational thought patterns that contribute to negative emotions. Some common cognitive distortions include all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, and disqualifying the positive.\n\nFor example, when you think, \"I'm not good enough,\" you might be engaging in all-or-nothing thinking. This distortion involves seeing things in black-and-white terms, without acknowledging the shades of gray in between. In reality, everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and nobody is perfect.\n\nPatient: I can see how I might be falling into that trap. I often feel like if I'm not excelling at something, then I'm a complete failure.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Arjun. Another cognitive distortion you might be experiencing is disqualifying the positive, which involves dismissing or minimizing positive experiences or achievements. For instance, if you receive praise for your work, you might think, \"They're just being nice,\" instead of acknowledging your accomplishments.\n\nPatient: Yes, I do that a lot. I have a hard time accepting compliments or recognizing my own successes.\n\nTherapist: Recognizing these cognitive distortions is an important step in challenging them. One way to do this is by examining the evidence for and against these thoughts. When you think, \"I'm not good enough,\" what evidence do you have to support this thought? And what evidence do you have against it?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the evidence for the thought is that I'm not as productive as I used to be, and I'm struggling with my depression. But the evidence against it is that I have accomplished a lot in my life, and I have a loving family who supports me.\n\nTherapist: That's excellent, Arjun. You're already starting to challenge these negative thoughts by looking at the evidence. Another strategy is to consider alternative perspectives. How might someone else view your situation? What would you say to a friend who expressed similar thoughts?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell a friend that they're being too hard on themselves and that everyone goes through difficult times. I'd remind them of their strengths and accomplishments.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Arjun. By offering yourself the same compassion and understanding you would extend to a friend, you can start to shift your perspective and challenge those negative thoughts. This is something we can continue to work on together in our sessions.",
