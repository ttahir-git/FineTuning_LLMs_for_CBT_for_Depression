  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the coping strategies we discussed, like scheduling \"being\" time and using my coping kit. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some improvements in my mood and overall well-being.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on implementing the coping strategies and that you've noticed some improvements. Can you tell me more about the challenges you've faced while trying to incorporate these strategies into your daily life?\n\nPatient: One of the main challenges has been prioritizing self-care and making it a consistent part of my routine. I often find myself getting caught up in other responsibilities and neglecting my own needs. Additionally, I've struggled with the concept of \"being\" time, as I'm so used to focusing on productivity and accomplishments.\n\nTherapist: It's common to face challenges when trying to establish new habits and shift long-held beliefs. The fact that you're aware of these challenges is an important first step. Today, I'd like to focus on addressing these challenges and exploring ways to make self-care and \"being\" time more manageable and meaningful for you. Does that sound okay?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds great. I'm open to any suggestions you have.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. Before we dive in, let's set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to:\n\n1. Check in on your progress with the positive data log and discuss any new insights or challenges that have come up.\n2. Explore your experiences with finding purpose and meaning in retirement and other areas of life.\n3. Introduce a new strategy called \"mindfulness\" to help you practice being present and engaged in the moment.\n4. Discuss any other topics or concerns that you'd like to address.\n\nHow does that agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
