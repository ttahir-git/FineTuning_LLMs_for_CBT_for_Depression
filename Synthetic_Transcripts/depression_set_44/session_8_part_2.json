  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying to use the distress tolerance techniques we discussed, like deep breathing and grounding exercises, when I feel overwhelmed. It's been helpful in the moment, but I still find myself getting caught up in negative thoughts and emotions later on.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been practicing the distress tolerance techniques and finding them helpful in the moment. It's also common for negative thoughts and emotions to resurface later on. That's where cognitive restructuring can be particularly useful. Let's explore one of the situations where you experienced overwhelming emotions recently. Can you walk me through what happened?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I decided to try reconnecting with one of my hobbies, which is playing the piano. I used to find it really enjoyable and relaxing, but lately, it's been frustrating. I sat down to play, and within a few minutes, I found myself getting irritated with every mistake I made. I started thinking, \"I used to be so much better at this. I'm never going to get back to that level.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. I can hear the frustration in your words. Let's break this down using a thought record. First, can you identify the emotions you were feeling in that moment and rate their intensity on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I was feeling frustrated, disappointed in myself, and a bit hopeless. I'd say the frustration was around 80, the disappointment was 75, and the hopelessness was 60.\n\nTherapist: Okay, now let's identify the automatic thoughts that were going through your mind. You mentioned thinking, \"I used to be so much better at this. I'm never going to get back to that level.\" Were there any other thoughts?\n\nPatient: I also thought, \"I'm wasting my time trying to play the piano again. I'll never be satisfied with my performance.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for identifying those thoughts. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you'll never get back to the level you used to be at?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been away from playing regularly for a while, and I'm noticing that my skills have declined. I'm making more mistakes than I used to.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against the idea that you'll never get back to that level?\n\nPatient: I suppose that with practice and patience, I could potentially improve. I've seen others take breaks from hobbies and eventually regain their skills.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought that you're wasting your time trying to play the piano again.\n\nPatient: The evidence for it is that I'm not enjoying it as much as I used to, and I'm feeling frustrated. The evidence against it is that I used to find playing the piano very fulfilling, and it could be a source of enjoyment and relaxation for me again in the future.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. Based on the evidence you've identified, can you come up with an alternative thought that's more balanced and realistic?\n\nPatient: I guess an alternative thought could be, \"It's going to take time and practice to regain my skills, but it's not impossible. Even if I don't get back to the level I used to be at, playing the piano can still be a meaningful and enjoyable hobby for me.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges the challenges you're facing while also recognizing the potential benefits of continuing to play the piano. Now, if you were to think this way, how do you think it would impact the emotions you identified earlier?\n\nPatient: I think I'd feel less frustrated and disappointed in myself. The hopelessness would probably decrease too. Maybe the frustration would go down to 50, the disappointment to 40, and the hopelessness to 30.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in the intensity of those emotions. This is a great example of how challenging negative thoughts and finding more balanced alternatives can help manage overwhelming emotions. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to apply it in the moment when you're feeling overwhelmed.",
