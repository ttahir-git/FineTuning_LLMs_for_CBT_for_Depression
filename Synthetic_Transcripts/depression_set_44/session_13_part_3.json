  "transcript": "Therapist: It's great that you've been making an effort to engage in activities you enjoy, even when motivation is low. Pushing yourself a bit is an important part of behavioral activation. As for the distress tolerance techniques, consistency is key. It's normal to struggle with using them regularly at first, but with practice, they will become more automatic.\n\nLet's explore the situations where you've had difficulty using the techniques consistently. Can you think of a specific example where you felt overwhelmed but struggled to use the distress tolerance skills effectively?\n\nPatient: Last week, I received an email from an old colleague asking for my help with a research project. I used to love collaborating on projects like this, but now the thought of taking on that kind of responsibility just feels overwhelming. I tried to use deep breathing to calm myself down, but I couldn't focus on it, and I ended up feeling even more anxious.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. It's understandable that the thought of taking on a research project would feel overwhelming, especially given your recent struggles with depression. In situations like this, it can be helpful to break down the distress tolerance techniques into smaller, more manageable steps.\n\nFor example, instead of trying to go directly from feeling overwhelmed to deep breathing, you could start with a simpler technique, like grounding yourself in the present moment. This could involve focusing on your senses, like noticing five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. Once you feel more grounded, you could then try the deep breathing exercise.\n\nAnother strategy is to use positive self-talk to remind yourself that feeling overwhelmed is temporary and that you have the skills to manage your emotions. You could say something like, \"I'm feeling overwhelmed right now, but that's okay. I can use my distress tolerance techniques to help myself feel more calm and centered.\"\n\nPatient: I like the idea of breaking it down into smaller steps. I think I've been putting too much pressure on myself to go from feeling overwhelmed to completely calm, and that's just not realistic.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's about taking small steps to help yourself feel a little bit better, rather than trying to completely eliminate the overwhelming feelings all at once. As you practice these techniques more regularly, you'll likely find that it becomes easier to manage the overwhelming emotions.\n\nAnother important aspect of distress tolerance is self-care. Engaging in activities that help you feel grounded and nurtured can make it easier to manage difficult emotions when they arise. This could include things like taking a warm bath, listening to calming music, or spending time in nature.\n\nPatient: I've always enjoyed spending time in nature, but I haven't made it a priority lately. I think I'll try to schedule some time each week to go for a walk in the park or sit by the lake.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great idea. Incorporating self-care activities into your routine can help build resilience and make it easier to manage overwhelming emotions when they come up.\n\nAs we continue to work on distress tolerance, we can explore additional techniques and strategies to help you feel more equipped to handle challenging situations. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay if it feels difficult at times. The important thing is that you're making an effort and practicing the skills regularly.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the encouragement. I'm starting to feel more hopeful about my ability to manage my emotions.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Your willingness to practice these techniques and engage in self-care activities is a great sign of progress. As we continue to work together, we can build on these skills and explore additional strategies for managing your depression symptoms.\n\nSpeaking of progress, let's revisit your goals for behavioral activation. Last session, we discussed setting a small goal related to attending a choir rehearsal. How did that go?",
