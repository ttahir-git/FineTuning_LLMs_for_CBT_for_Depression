  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the communication skills with my husband, but it's been challenging. I find myself slipping back into old patterns of putting my needs last. I did complete some thought records, which helped me recognize how often I engage in negative self-talk.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been working on the thought records and have gained some insight into your negative self-talk. Changing long-standing patterns can be difficult, and it's normal to face challenges along the way. Let's explore this further. Can you share a specific situation where you found it hard to prioritize your needs?\n\nPatient: Well, last week, I had planned to spend an afternoon doing photography, which I find relaxing. But my mother had a particularly bad day, and I felt guilty for even considering leaving her. I ended up canceling my plans and staying home to care for her.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. It highlights the struggle between self-care and caregiving responsibilities. Let's add this to our agenda for today, along with reviewing your thought records and discussing your progress with cognitive restructuring. We can also explore any challenges or setbacks you encountered while practicing communication skills and self-care. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I also wanted to mention that I've been feeling more anxious lately, especially when I try to take time for myself. It's like I'm waiting for something terrible to happen if I'm not constantly available for my family.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you brought up the increased anxiety. That's an important issue we should address. We can discuss strategies for managing anxiety and explore the thoughts and beliefs that might be contributing to it. Let's add that to our agenda as well. So, our plan for today includes:\n\n1. Reviewing your thought records and discussing your progress with cognitive restructuring\n2. Exploring challenges with practicing communication skills and self-care\n3. Addressing the increased anxiety and its potential underlying thoughts and beliefs\n4. Discussing the situation where you canceled your photography plans to care for your mother\n\nDoes this agenda cover the main points you'd like to focus on today, or is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it. I'm looking forward to discussing these topics and getting your guidance.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your thought records. Can you share an example of a negative thought you challenged and how you reframed it?",
