  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our third session. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last meeting. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate, and I want to encourage you to fact-check anything that doesn't seem quite right. Lastly, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. If you ever feel that you're in crisis or need immediate support, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm here today because I want to continue working on managing my depression and improving my overall well-being.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Priya. Before we set our agenda for today's session, let's take a moment to review your homework from last time. Were you able to keep a thought record and practice challenging any negative thoughts that came up?",
