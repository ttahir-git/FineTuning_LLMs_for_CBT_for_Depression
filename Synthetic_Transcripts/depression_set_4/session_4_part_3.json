  "transcript": "Patient: I can see how challenging my thoughts can help me feel a bit better in the moment. But I'm still struggling with finding time for self-care activities, like the photography you mentioned last session. I feel guilty taking time away from my mother, even if it's just for a short while.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel guilty, Priya, but it's crucial to remember that taking care of yourself is not selfish. In fact, by engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, you'll be better equipped to handle the challenges of caregiving. This is where the concept of behavioral activation comes in. When we're depressed, we often avoid activities that could potentially make us feel better, leading to a cycle of inactivity and worsening mood. Behavioral activation helps break this cycle by gradually reintroducing enjoyable and meaningful activities into our lives.\n\nPatient: I can see how that makes sense. But how do I find the time and energy to do these activities when I'm already so overwhelmed?\n\nTherapist: That's a great question. The key is to start small and be realistic about what you can manage. Instead of trying to carve out hours for photography, perhaps you could begin with just 15 minutes a day. It might feel strange at first, but over time, it will become easier and more natural. We can also brainstorm together to find ways to incorporate photography into your daily routine, like taking photos during a walk with your mother or capturing moments with your grandchildren.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of starting small. Maybe I could take a few minutes to photograph the flowers in my garden each day. It's something I used to enjoy, and it wouldn't take too much time away from my responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful idea, Priya! Engaging in photography, even for a short period, can provide a much-needed break and help you reconnect with a sense of joy and creativity. As we continue to work together, we can explore other activities that you might find enjoyable and find ways to incorporate them into your routine. Remember, self-care doesn't have to be time-consuming or elaborate. It's about finding small moments of peace and fulfillment amidst the challenges.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I'm starting to see how making time for myself can actually help me be a better caregiver in the long run. I'll try to take a few minutes each day to focus on photography and see how it goes.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Priya. Remember, it's okay to start small and be patient with yourself. Incorporating self-care into your life is a process, and it might take some time to find what works best for you. As you practice behavioral activation and challenge negative thoughts, you'll likely find that your mood improves and you feel more capable of managing the stress of caregiving.",
