  "transcript": "Therapist: Welcome back, Priya! It's great to see you again for our second session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge that as an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information or lack the ability to interpret non-verbal cues. Additionally, if you ever experience thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please know that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. In such cases, I would guide you to seek appropriate help from a qualified professional. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. \n\nLet's start by reviewing the homework from our last session. Were you able to keep a thought record to identify negative thoughts and their triggers?\n\nPatient: Yes, I did my best to keep track of my thoughts over the past week. It was challenging at times, but I managed to write down some of the negative thoughts that kept popping up. I noticed that many of them were related to my role as a caregiver for my mother and the feelings of being overwhelmed and trapped.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Priya. Recognizing those negative thought patterns is an important first step. Would you be comfortable sharing a specific example from your thought record?\n\nPatient: Sure. One thought that kept coming up was, \"I'm not doing enough for my mother. I should be able to handle this better.\" It made me feel guilty and inadequate, like I'm failing in my duties as a daughter.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Priya. That's a common thought pattern in caregivers, and it can be very distressing. In CBT, we look at how our thoughts influence our feelings and behaviors. In this case, the thought \"I'm not doing enough for my mother\" leads to feelings of guilt and inadequacy, which can then impact your behavior, such as withdrawing from activities or neglecting your own self-care.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I've definitely been neglecting my own needs and pulling away from things I used to enjoy.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Priya. Today, I'd like to focus on helping you challenge those negative thoughts and develop more balanced and compassionate ways of thinking about your situation. We'll also explore some coping strategies for managing difficult emotions and work on engaging in activities that promote positive feelings and a sense of accomplishment. How does that sound for our agenda today?",
