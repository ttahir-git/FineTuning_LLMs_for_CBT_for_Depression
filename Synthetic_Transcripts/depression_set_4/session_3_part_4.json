We'll work together to ensure that the changes we're making feel manageable and aligned with your values and goals.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel a bit more hopeful knowing that we'll be working on this together.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Priya. Before we wrap up today's session, let's review the goals and treatment plan we've established.
