  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our 16th session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. Before we dive into today's agenda, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information or lack the ability to interpret non-verbal cues. In case of a crisis or emergency, I'm not equipped to provide direct intervention, and it's essential to seek appropriate help from local resources or professionals. With that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health. How have you been since our last session?",
