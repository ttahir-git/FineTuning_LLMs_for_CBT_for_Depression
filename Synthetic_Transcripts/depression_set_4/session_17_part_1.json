  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that some of the information I provide may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. I also can't observe or interpret non-verbal cues. However, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities within these constraints. \n\nTo start, I'd like to do a thorough check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges that have come up for you?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the thought records and positive data log. It's been challenging at times, but I do feel like I'm starting to recognize my negative thought patterns more easily. However, I've also been feeling quite overwhelmed with my caregiving responsibilities for my mother. It's been taking a toll on my mood and energy levels.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Priya. It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed, even though it's been challenging. Recognizing negative thought patterns is an important first step. I also hear that your caregiving responsibilities have been overwhelming lately, and that's been impacting your mood and energy. Let's make sure to discuss this further during our session today.\n\nFor our agenda, I'd like to review your thought records and positive data log, explore your experiences with practicing assertive communication and self-care, and continue working on reframing negative beliefs about asking for help and expressing needs. Given what you've shared about feeling overwhelmed with caregiving, I think it would also be helpful to discuss additional coping strategies for managing stress and anxiety related to your caregiving responsibilities. What are your thoughts on this agenda? Is there anything else you'd like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: That agenda sounds good to me, Nova. I definitely want to talk more about managing the stress of caregiving. It's been really challenging lately, and I feel like I'm not coping well. I'm open to any suggestions or strategies you might have.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Priya. We'll make sure to focus on coping strategies for managing caregiving stress. I understand how challenging it can be, and it's important that we work together to find ways to support you through this. Before we dive into that, let's start by reviewing your thought records and positive data log. Can you share some examples of the thoughts you've been working on challenging and the evidence you've gathered for your new core belief?",
