  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please let me know if there's anything important I might be missing. With that said, let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss today?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like cognitive restructuring and self-care. I did manage to schedule a photography outing with a friend, which felt really good. However, I still find myself struggling with guilty thoughts when I prioritize my own needs over my family's, especially my mother's care. It's like I can't shake this belief that I'm being selfish.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you were able to schedule a photography outing and that it felt good to engage in an activity you enjoy. This is a positive step towards self-care and finding balance. Regarding the guilty thoughts, it's understandable that these beliefs are deeply ingrained and may take time to change. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about a specific situation where you felt guilty for prioritizing your needs?\n\nPatient: Well, last weekend, I had planned to visit my daughter and grandchildren. But my mother was having a particularly bad day, and I felt I couldn't leave her. I ended up canceling my plans at the last minute. My daughter was understanding, but I still felt like I was letting her and my grandchildren down. I know my mother needs me, but I also want to be there for my daughter and grandchildren.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a difficult situation, Priya. It's clear that you care deeply for both your mother and your daughter's family. Let's look at this through the lens of cognitive distortions. When you chose to stay with your mother, what thoughts went through your mind about your daughter and grandchildren?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I'm a terrible mother and grandmother for canceling on them. They must think I don't care about them. I'm always putting my mother's needs before theirs.\"\n\nTherapist: I can see how those thoughts would lead to feelings of guilt. Let's examine them more closely. It seems like there might be some all-or-nothing thinking, where you believe you're either a good mother/grandmother or a terrible one, with no in-between. There may also be some mind-reading, assuming your daughter and grandchildren think you don't care about them. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: You're right. I guess I didn't consider that there could be an in-between. And I don't actually know what they're thinking. My daughter did say she understood.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By recognizing these cognitive distortions, we can start to challenge and reframe those thoughts. Perhaps a more balanced thought could be, \"I had to make a difficult decision based on my mother's needs at the moment, but that doesn't mean I'm a terrible mother or grandmother. My daughter understands, and I can plan another visit soon.\" How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That does sound more balanced. I guess I need to work on giving myself some grace and not jumping to the worst conclusions.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Priya. Learning to challenge these distorted thoughts and find more balanced perspectives is a key part of CBT. As we continue to work on this, it will become easier to catch these thoughts and reframe them in the moment. Let's make a note to practice this more in today's session.\n\nNow, let's set an agenda for our time together. We've already touched on cognitive restructuring and challenging guilty thoughts. What else would you like to prioritize today?",
