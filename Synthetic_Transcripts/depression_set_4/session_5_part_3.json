  "transcript": "Here is part 3 of 4 for the CBT session transcript with Priya:\n\nPatient: I've heard of mindfulness before, but I haven't really tried it. I think I could benefit from learning some techniques to manage my emotions when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: Mindfulness can be a very effective tool for managing overwhelming emotions. It helps you stay present and grounded, rather than getting caught up in negative thoughts or emotions. One simple mindfulness technique is deep breathing. \n\nTo practice deep breathing, find a comfortable seated position and close your eyes. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, counting to four. Hold the breath for a count of four, then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Repeat this process for several minutes, focusing your attention on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body.\n\nAs you practice deep breathing, you may find that your mind wanders. That's okay - simply notice the thoughts without judgment, and gently bring your focus back to your breath. With regular practice, deep breathing can help calm your mind and body when you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nAnother mindfulness technique is called a body scan. This involves systematically focusing on different parts of your body, from your toes to the top of your head, and noticing any sensations or areas of tension. As with deep breathing, the goal is to observe without judgment and bring your attention back to the present moment whenever your mind wanders.\n\nWould you like to try a brief deep breathing exercise now, or would you prefer to discuss another distress tolerance technique?",
