  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's good to see you again. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week. I tried to do the homework you assigned, but I struggled with finding time for photography. My mother's health has been declining, and I've been feeling overwhelmed with caregiving responsibilities. I'm also still having trouble with negative thoughts and feeling guilty for prioritizing my own needs.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it's been a difficult week for you, Priya. Caregiving can be emotionally and physically draining, and it's common to feel overwhelmed. Let's take a moment to explore your emotions further. Can you tell me more about the negative thoughts you've been experiencing and how they've been impacting you?\n\nPatient: I keep thinking that I'm not doing enough for my mother and that I'm being selfish for wanting time for myself. I feel like I should be able to handle everything without complaining or needing help. These thoughts make me feel guilty and ashamed, and I end up feeling even more exhausted and drained.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to have those thoughts, Priya, but I want to remind you that they are not necessarily accurate or helpful. The way we think can greatly influence how we feel and behave. This is known as the CBT triangle, where our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. When we have negative thoughts, it can lead to negative emotions and unhelpful behaviors. Let's work on challenging some of these negative thoughts today. Does that sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I want to find a way to balance my own needs with my responsibilities as a caregiver.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's set an agenda for our session today. We can start by reviewing your experience with the homework assignments and discussing any challenges you faced. Then, we can practice some cognitive restructuring techniques to challenge your negative thoughts. We'll also explore how you can incorporate self-care activities, like photography, into your routine. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm hoping to find some strategies to cope with my emotions and make time for myself without feeling guilty.\n\nTherapist: I'm confident that we can work together to find strategies that will help you. Remember, self-care is not selfish. It's essential for your well-being and will ultimately make you a better caregiver. Let's start by discussing your experience with the thought records. Were you able to identify any negative thoughts and challenge them?",
