  "transcript": "Patient: Some small self-care practices I could try to incorporate might be taking a few minutes to do some deep breathing exercises when I'm feeling stressed, or maybe listening to a guided meditation before bed to help me relax. I could also try to make time for a short walk outside each day, even if it's just around the block.\n\nTherapist: Those are all excellent ideas for small self-care practices, Priya. Taking a few minutes for deep breathing or a guided meditation can make a big difference in managing stress levels throughout the day. And making time for a short walk outside is a great way to get some fresh air and gentle movement, which can also help boost your mood and energy.\n\nRemember, the key with self-care is to start small and be consistent. It's better to choose one or two practices that feel manageable and do them regularly, rather than trying to do too much at once and feeling overwhelmed. As we've discussed before, self-care isn't selfish - it's an essential part of maintaining your own well-being so that you can continue to care for others.\n\nI'd like to explore a bit more about how your thoughts and feelings might be impacting your behavior when it comes to self-care. Can you think of a recent situation where you wanted to practice self-care, but maybe didn't follow through? What thoughts or feelings came up for you in that moment?",
