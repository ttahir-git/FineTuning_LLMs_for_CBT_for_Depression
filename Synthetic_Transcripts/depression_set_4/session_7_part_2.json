  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I think I struggled with the thought records because I sometimes forget to do them in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed or guilty. It's hard to remember to stop and write things down when I'm in the middle of taking care of my mother or dealing with other responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Priya. It can be challenging to remember to use the thought records when you're in the midst of a difficult situation. One strategy that might help is to set aside a specific time each day to reflect on your thoughts and feelings and complete the thought records retroactively. This way, you can still benefit from the exercise even if you can't do it in the moment. Another option is to keep a small notebook or your phone with you and jot down a few quick notes when you notice strong emotions or negative thoughts, then elaborate on them later when you have more time.\n\nPatient: Those are good ideas. I think setting aside a specific time each day could work well for me. I could do it in the evening after my mother has gone to bed and I have some quiet time to myself.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. Consistency is key with thought records, so finding a routine that works for you is important. Now, let's discuss your experience with the self-compassion breaks. You mentioned that it felt a bit awkward, which is completely normal when trying something new. Can you tell me more about what felt uncomfortable or challenging about the practice?\n\nPatient: I think it's just the idea of being kind to myself that feels foreign. I'm so used to putting everyone else's needs before my own and feeling guilty for taking care of myself. When I tried the self-compassion break, I had a hard time believing the kind words I was saying to myself.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that self-compassion feels foreign at first, especially given your cultural background and the messages you've received about prioritizing others' needs. It's okay if you don't fully believe the kind words at first \u2013 that's why it's called a practice. The more you do it, the more natural it will feel, and the more you'll start to internalize those compassionate messages.\n\nOne way to make self-compassion feel more accessible is to imagine what you would say to a dear friend or loved one who was struggling with similar feelings of guilt or self-criticism. Would you tell them they were being selfish for taking care of themselves, or would you offer them understanding and kindness? Try to extend that same compassion to yourself.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I would never speak to a friend the way I sometimes speak to myself. I'll try to keep that in mind when I practice the self-compassion breaks.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, self-compassion is a skill that takes time to develop, so be patient with yourself as you practice. Now, I'd like to introduce a new distress tolerance technique called progressive muscle relaxation. This can be helpful when you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed, as it helps to release physical tension and promote a sense of calm in the body.",
