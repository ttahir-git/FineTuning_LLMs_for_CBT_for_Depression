  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 6. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like thought records and deep breathing. It's been challenging at times, but I have noticed some small improvements in my mood. I'm still struggling with finding time for self-care and managing the guilt I feel when I prioritize my own needs.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. It's completely normal to face challenges along the way, and we can definitely explore those further today. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I'd like to discuss the challenges I've been facing with self-care and managing guilt. I also want to talk about my relationship with my husband and how my depression has been affecting it. And maybe we could review the thought records I've been keeping?\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Priya. We can start by reviewing your thought records and discussing any insights or challenges that came up while using them. Then, we can explore the difficulties you've been experiencing with self-care and guilt, and how they might be related to your automatic thoughts and beliefs. Finally, we'll discuss your relationship with your husband and how your depression has been impacting it. Does that agenda work for you?",
