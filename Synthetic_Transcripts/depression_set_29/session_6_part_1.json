  "transcript": "Therapist: Welcome back, Arjun! It's great to see you again for our sixth session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to start by acknowledging my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the 5-5-5 mindfulness exercise and thought records. I had the conversation with my sister about needing more support, and it went better than I expected. She was understanding and offered to help out more with caring for our mother and the household chores. That being said, I still find myself feeling guilty at times for prioritizing my own needs.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and that the conversation with your sister went well. It's a positive step that she was understanding and offered to help out more. Regarding the guilt you're experiencing, that's a common challenge when starting to prioritize self-care. Let's explore that further today. How about we set an agenda for our session? We can review your homework, discuss your progress with the CBT techniques, and explore the guilt you've been feeling. Does that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm also wondering if we could discuss some additional coping strategies for managing stress at work and home. I find myself getting easily overwhelmed, and I'm not sure how to handle it in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss additional coping strategies for managing stress at work and home. That's a great addition to our agenda. To start, let's review your homework from the last session. How did you find practicing the 5-5-5 mindfulness exercise when feeling overwhelmed?",
