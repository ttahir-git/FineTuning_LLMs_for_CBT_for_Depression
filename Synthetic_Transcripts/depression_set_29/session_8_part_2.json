  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share an example of a thought record I completed this week. One day, I was feeling really overwhelmed with taking care of my mom and managing work responsibilities. My emotions were stress and sadness, both at about an 8 out of 10. The automatic thought I identified was \"I can't handle all of these responsibilities, and I'm going to let everyone down.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Arjun. Identifying the situation, emotions, and automatic thoughts is a great start. What evidence did you come up with for and against the thought \"I can't handle all of these responsibilities, and I'm going to let everyone down\"?\n\nPatient: For evidence supporting the thought, I listed things like \"I'm constantly feeling exhausted and overwhelmed\" and \"I'm not able to give 100% to any of my responsibilities.\" For evidence against the thought, I struggled a bit more. I managed to write \"I have been managing all of these responsibilities for months now, even if it's difficult\" and \"My family appreciates what I'm doing, even if I'm not perfect.\"\n\nTherapist: It's common to find it more challenging to come up with evidence against our negative thoughts, as they often feel very true in the moment. You did a good job identifying some evidence against the thought, even if it was difficult. One additional piece of evidence against the thought could be that you're actively seeking support and learning coping strategies in therapy, which shows that you're taking steps to manage your responsibilities more effectively.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I didn't think to include that as evidence against the thought.\n\nTherapist: Now, let's look at the alternative thought you came up with. Were you able to reframe the original thought in a more balanced way?\n\nPatient: I wrote, \"Balancing all of these responsibilities is challenging, but I am doing my best, and that is enough.\" But to be honest, it still feels like I'm not doing enough.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Arjun. Reframing our thoughts in a more balanced way can feel uncomfortable at first, especially if we've been stuck in a pattern of negative thinking for a while. It's okay if the alternative thought doesn't feel completely true right away. The goal is to develop more flexible and compassionate ways of thinking over time. Let's explore this a bit further. What do you think might be an underlying belief that contributes to the thought \"I can't handle all of these responsibilities, and I'm going to let everyone down\"?",
