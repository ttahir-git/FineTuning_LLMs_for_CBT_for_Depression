  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you again for our third session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few important things about our work together. As an AI therapist, I have some limitations - I can't access any information about you beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and sometimes I might generate information that's not fully accurate. I'm also not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. And since our communication is text-based, I can't pick up on non-verbal cues like body language or tone of voice. I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page about those things. Do you have any questions or concerns about that?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. It's good to know the boundaries of what you can and can't do. I'm comfortable with that.\n\nTherapist: Great, thanks for letting me know. So, I see you've brought the summary from our last session - that's really helpful. Before we review your homework, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today. I'd like to spend some time finalizing our conceptualization of your depression and start setting some specific, measurable goals for our work together. We can also leave some time to discuss anything else that's on your mind. How does that sound? Is there anything else you'd like to make sure we cover today?",
