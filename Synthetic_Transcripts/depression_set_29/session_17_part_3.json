  "transcript": "Therapist: If you started to prioritize your own needs a bit more, it's possible that you might feel less overwhelmed and more energized. This, in turn, could help you be more present and effective when you are caring for your mother and helping your siblings. It's not about neglecting your family, but rather finding a balance that allows you to be there for them in a sustainable way. What are your thoughts on this perspective?\n\nPatient: I can see how taking care of myself could actually help me be a better caregiver and sibling. It's just hard to break out of the mindset that I'm being selfish when I do something for myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a common concern, and it's understandable given your cultural background and family values. Let's explore this idea of selfishness a bit further. What does being selfish mean to you, and where do you think this belief comes from?\n\nPatient: To me, being selfish means putting my own desires above the needs of others, especially my family. I think this belief comes from my upbringing, where I was taught to always put family first and sacrifice my own needs for their well-being.\n\nTherapist: It's valuable to understand where our beliefs come from, as it can help us examine their validity and relevance in our current lives. While it's admirable to prioritize family, it's also important to recognize that taking care of yourself is not necessarily selfish. In fact, by ensuring your own well-being, you're better equipped to support your loved ones in the long run. Let's try to reframe this belief in a way that acknowledges both your family values and your personal needs. How could you express this belief in a more balanced way?\n\nPatient: I guess I could say that taking care of myself is a way of honoring my family values, because when I'm in a good place mentally and emotionally, I can be a better son and brother.\n\nTherapist: That's a beautiful reframe, Arjun. By taking care of yourself, you're actually living out your family values in a sustainable and meaningful way. It's about finding a balance between self-care and caring for others, rather than seeing them as mutually exclusive. As we continue to work together, we can explore practical ways to implement this balanced approach in your daily life.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It feels more manageable when I think about it as finding a balance, rather than completely changing my priorities.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, it's about making small, meaningful changes that align with your values and well-being. Now, let's shift our focus to the pressure you're feeling about finding a better-paying job. You mentioned that you're not sure where to start or what you're qualified for with your engineering degree. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and emotions that come up for you around this topic?\n\nPatient: I feel anxious and overwhelmed when I think about job searching. I worry that my degree isn't enough, and that I don't have the experience or skills that employers are looking for. I also feel guilty for not being able to provide more financial support for my family right now.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel anxious and overwhelmed when facing the job search process, especially with the added pressure of supporting your family. Let's break down some of these thoughts and explore them further. When you say you worry that your degree isn't enough, what specific concerns come to mind?\n\nPatient: I worry that my degree is too general, and that employers are looking for more specialized skills or experience. I also worry that I'll be competing with people who have more qualifications or connections in the industry.\n\nTherapist: It's common to have these concerns when entering the job market, but it's also important to recognize the value of your degree and the skills you've developed through your education and work experience. Let's take a moment to identify some of your strengths and transferable skills that could be relevant to potential employers. What are some skills or experiences you've gained through your engineering degree and your current job that could be applicable to other roles?\n\nPatient: Through my engineering degree, I've developed problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and the ability to work on complex projects. In my current job, I've gained experience in manufacturing processes, teamwork, and meeting deadlines. I guess these skills could be relevant to other engineering or technical roles.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, those are valuable skills that many employers look for, regardless of the specific industry or role. Problem-solving, attention to detail, teamwork, and meeting deadlines are transferable skills that can be applied in various contexts. As we explore job opportunities, we can focus on highlighting these skills and experiences in your applications and interviews. Remember, your degree and work experience have provided you with a strong foundation, even if it may not feel like it at times.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I hadn't thought about how my skills could transfer to different roles. It makes me feel a bit more hopeful about my job prospects.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful. Reframing your perspective and focusing on your strengths can make a big difference in how you approach the job search process. Another important aspect to consider is your network and resources. Have you thought about reaching out to any professors, classmates, or colleagues who might have connections or advice related to your job search?",
