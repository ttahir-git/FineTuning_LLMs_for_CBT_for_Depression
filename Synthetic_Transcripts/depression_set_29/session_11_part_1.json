  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the stress management strategies we discussed, like taking breaks and setting boundaries at work. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and energy levels. I also scheduled an enjoyable activity for myself, which was going for a hike in the park. It felt good to have some time to myself and connect with nature.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been making efforts to manage your stress and engage in self-care activities. Taking small steps towards change is crucial, and it's wonderful that you're noticing some positive effects on your mood and energy. Let's explore your experiences with the stress management strategies and the hike in more detail. How did it feel to set boundaries at work? What thoughts and emotions came up for you during the hike?\n\nPatient: Setting boundaries at work was difficult at first. I felt guilty for saying no to extra tasks and taking breaks, but I reminded myself that it's necessary for my well-being. During the hike, I felt a sense of peace and connection with myself. It was refreshing to have some time away from my responsibilities and just focus on being present in nature.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience guilt when setting boundaries, especially if you're used to putting others' needs before your own. Recognizing the importance of self-care and giving yourself permission to prioritize your well-being is a significant step. The feelings of peace and connection you experienced during the hike are wonderful examples of how engaging in enjoyable activities can positively impact your mental health. Let's continue to build on these experiences and explore ways to incorporate more self-care into your routine.\n\nFor today's session, I propose we focus on the following agenda items:\n1. Review your experiences with the stress management strategies and behavioral activation exercise (hike)\n2. Discuss any challenges or questions that arose while completing your homework\n3. Introduce the concept of cognitive distortions and explore how they might be influencing your thoughts\n4. Continue practicing cognitive restructuring techniques, such as thought records and reframing negative thoughts\n5. Develop a plan for incorporating more self-care activities into your routine\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
