  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you again for session 15. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Also, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Additionally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues.\n\nWith that said, I'd love to hear how you've been doing since our last session. Can you share with me how your mood has been and if there have been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the self-care goals we discussed. I set aside 10 minutes each day to do something just for myself, like listening to music or taking a short walk. It hasn't been easy, as I often feel guilty for taking time away from my family responsibilities. However, I did notice that on the days I managed to do this, I felt a bit more relaxed and energized.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been making an effort to prioritize self-care, even if it's challenging at times. The guilt you're experiencing is understandable, given your cultural background and the strong sense of responsibility you feel towards your family. Remember that taking care of yourself is not selfish; it's necessary for your overall well-being and can actually help you be more present and effective in supporting your loved ones.\n\nYou mentioned feeling more relaxed and energized on the days you practiced self-care. That's a positive outcome! Let's build on that. For today's session, what would you like to focus on? We could explore ways to manage the guilt around self-care, discuss your progress with the thought records and Positive Data Log, or address any other concerns you might have.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing the guilt around self-care and also discuss my progress with the thought records and Positive Data Log. I've been trying to reframe my negative thoughts, but I sometimes struggle with identifying the evidence against them.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan for today's session. We'll start by discussing your progress with the thought records and Positive Data Log, and then explore strategies for managing guilt around self-care.\n\nRegarding the thought records, can you share an example of a negative thought you struggled to find evidence against? We can work through it together to help you practice identifying evidence more effectively.",
