  "transcript": "Patient: A typical day for me starts around 5:30 AM. I get up, help my mom with her morning routine, and then make breakfast for my siblings before they head off to school. After that, I usually have to rush out the door to make it to work on time. I work from 7 AM to 5 PM, with a short lunch break. When I get home, I'm usually pretty exhausted, but I have to help my mom with her evening medications and make dinner for the family. After dinner, I try to spend some time with my siblings, helping them with their homework or just hanging out. By the time I get to bed, it's usually around 11 PM or later. I'm just so tired all the time, and I feel like I never get a break.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like your days are incredibly full and demanding, Arjun. With such a busy schedule, it's no wonder you're feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. I'm curious about how you've been coping with these feelings up until now. Have you found any strategies that help you manage your stress or emotional exhaustion, even if just for a short while?\n\nPatient: Honestly, the only thing that really helps is dancing. When I was in college, I used to take dance classes, and it was the one time during the week when I could just forget about everything else and focus on myself. But since I started working, I haven't had time for classes. Sometimes, when everyone's asleep, I'll put on some music and just dance in my room for a little while. It's not the same, but it's something.\n\nTherapist: Dancing seems to be a really important outlet for you, Arjun. It's great that you've found a way to incorporate it into your life, even if it's not in the same way as before. The fact that you're able to find moments of joy and self-expression through dance is a strength that we can build upon in therapy. I'm also wondering about your support system outside of your family. You mentioned earlier that you attend a support group for single parents. How has that experience been for you?\n\nPatient: The support group has been helpful, but it's also kind of challenging. It's good to know that I'm not the only one going through this kind of thing, but sometimes it feels like everyone else has it more together than I do. I don't always feel comfortable sharing my struggles, because I don't want people to think I'm weak or that I can't handle my responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: It's common to feel that way in group settings, Arjun. It's brave of you to show up and engage with the group, even if you don't always feel like you can share everything you're going through. Remember that everyone's journey is different, and it's okay to take your time opening up. In our individual sessions, we can work on building your confidence in expressing your emotions and needs, which may help you feel more comfortable sharing in the group setting as well.\n\nPatient: Yeah, that makes sense. I guess I just don't want to be a burden on anyone else, you know? I feel like I should be able to handle this on my own.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel that way, Arjun, especially given your cultural background and the expectations you've grown up with. However, it's important to recognize that reaching out for help is not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of strength and self-awareness. Everyone needs support at times, and learning to accept help from others is a crucial part of managing stress and maintaining your mental health. As we continue working together, we'll explore ways for you to challenge these beliefs and develop a more compassionate inner dialogue. How do you feel about what we've discussed so far today?",
