  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you again for our second session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to start by acknowledging that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me, and sometimes I might generate inaccurate responses. Also, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. With that said, I'm here to support you in managing your depression through CBT techniques. \n\nBefore we dive in, let's set an agenda for today's session. We'll review your homework, discussing the thought records and self-care activities you did over the past week. Then, I'd like to introduce the CBT framework and explore how your thoughts might be influencing your feelings and behaviors. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to discussing what I've noticed since our last session. I did the thought records and tried to do some self-care, but it wasn't easy with everything going on at home.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Arjun. Balancing family responsibilities with self-care can be challenging. Let's start by looking at your thought records. Can you share an example of a negative thought you noticed and what triggered it?",
