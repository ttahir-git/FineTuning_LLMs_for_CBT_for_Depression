  "transcript": "Patient: I haven't really thought about reaching out to my professors or classmates. I guess I've been feeling like I need to figure this out on my own.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel like you need to handle this on your own, but reaching out to your network can be a valuable resource during your job search. Your professors and classmates may have insights into the job market or connections in industries that align with your skills and interests. Asking for help or advice is not a sign of weakness, but rather a proactive step towards your goals. What do you think about the idea of reaching out to a professor or classmate who you trust or admire?\n\nPatient: I can see how that could be helpful. I do have a professor who I had a good relationship with during my studies. Maybe I could reach out to him and ask for some guidance.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great idea. Reaching out to a professor you respect and trust could provide valuable insights and support during your job search. It's also an opportunity to practice advocating for yourself and your career goals. Let's discuss how you might approach this conversation with your professor. What specific questions or topics would you want to discuss with him?\n\nPatient: I think I'd want to ask him about the current job market for engineers, and if he has any advice on how to make my applications stand out. I could also ask if he knows of any companies that are hiring or if he has any connections in the industry.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent topics to discuss with your professor. Asking for advice on making your applications stand out and inquiring about potential job opportunities or connections demonstrates your initiative and willingness to learn. Remember, your professor is invested in your success and will likely be happy to offer guidance and support. As we wrap up our session today, I'd like to assign some homework related to our discussion. First, I'd like you to continue using the thought records and Positive Data Log, focusing on reframing negative thoughts related to your job search and family responsibilities. Second, I encourage you to reach out to your professor and have that conversation we discussed. Finally, I'd like you to practice one self-care activity this week, even if it's just for a short period of time. This could be something as simple as taking a walk, reading a book, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy. The goal is to prioritize your well-being, even in small ways. How do you feel about this homework?\n\nPatient: I think the homework is manageable and relevant to what we've discussed today. I'm a bit nervous about reaching out to my professor, but I know it's an important step in my job search. I like the idea of incorporating self-care, even if it's just a small activity.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you find the homework manageable and relevant. It's normal to feel nervous about reaching out to your professor, but remember that it's a valuable opportunity for growth and support. As for the self-care activity, starting small is a great way to build the habit and prioritize your well-being. Before we end our session, I'd like to check in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful and empowered after our session today. Talking through my concerns and making a plan has helped me feel more in control of my situation. I know there's still a lot of work to do, but I feel like I have a clearer direction now.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and empowered. Recognizing that there's still work to do while also acknowledging your progress is a healthy and balanced perspective. Remember, change takes time, and every small step counts. I'm here to support you throughout this journey, and I'm confident in your ability to make meaningful changes in your life. If you have any questions or concerns between now and our next session, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care, Arjun, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed homework (thought records, Positive Data Log) and progress\n  - Explored challenges with family responsibilities and job search\n  - Discussed reframing the belief that prioritizing self-care is selfish\n  - Identified transferable skills and strengths relevant to job search\n  - Encouraged reaching out to professor for guidance and support\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Continued practice of identifying and reframing negative thoughts related to family responsibilities and job search\n  - Positive Data Log: Continued practice of gathering evidence for new core belief \"I am good enough\"\n  - Reframing beliefs: Explored and reframed the belief that prioritizing self-care is selfish\n  - Identifying strengths and transferable skills: Discussed how skills and experiences from engineering degree and current job can be applied to future roles\n  - Encouraging help-seeking behavior: Discussed the benefits of reaching out to professor for guidance and support in job search\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue using thought records and Positive Data Log, focusing on reframing negative thoughts related to family responsibilities and job search\n  - Reach out to professor to discuss job search advice, application strategies, and potential connections or opportunities\n  - Practice one self-care activity this week, even if it's just for a short period of time (e.g., taking a walk, reading a book, engaging in a hobby)\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details:\n  - Patient reported feeling more hopeful and empowered after the session\n  - Challenges include balancing family responsibilities, job search pressure, and prioritizing self-care\n  - Depression symptoms appear to be stable, with patient reporting some improvement in mood after discussing coping strategies and making a plan\n  - Patient's cultural background and family dynamics continue to play a significant role in their experiences and challenges\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Continued discussion of new core belief \"I am good enough\" and the importance of gathering evidence to support it\n  - Explored and reframed the intermediate belief \"Prioritizing self-care is selfish\" to \"Prioritizing self-care allows me to better support my family and aligns with my values\"\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Progress with thought records, Positive Data Log, and implementing coping strategies for work-related stress and family responsibilities\n  - Outcome of reaching out to professor for job search guidance and support\n  - Experience with practicing self-care activities and reframing beliefs around prioritizing personal well-being\n  - Continuing to build on CBT techniques (thought records, Positive Data Log, cognitive restructuring, self-compassion practices) and explore additional cognitive distortions\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review homework (thought records, Positive Data Log, reaching out to professor, self-care activity)\n  - Discuss the outcome of the conversation with the professor and any new insights or leads related to the job search\n  - Explore the patient's experience with practicing self-care and reframing beliefs around prioritizing personal well-being\n  - Continue practicing CBT techniques for managing negative thoughts and feelings related to family responsibilities and job search\n  - Introduce and practice additional cognitive restructuring techniques and self-compassion exercises as needed",
