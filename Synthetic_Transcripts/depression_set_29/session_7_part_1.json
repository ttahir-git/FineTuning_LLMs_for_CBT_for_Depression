  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you again for session 7. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the 5-5-5 mindfulness exercise and deep breathing. It's been challenging to stay consistent with them, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed with work and family responsibilities. I've also been struggling with feelings of guilt when I take time for myself.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we discussed, even if it's been challenging at times. It's common to experience guilt when prioritizing self-care, especially when you have a strong sense of responsibility towards your family. Let's explore those feelings further today. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to discuss strategies for managing the guilt I feel when taking time for myself. I also want to talk about how I can communicate my needs more effectively to my family, especially my sister. And maybe we could review the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique, as I haven't had a chance to practice it much since our last session.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan for our session today. We can start by discussing the guilt you experience around self-care and explore some strategies to manage those feelings. Then, we can focus on developing effective communication skills to express your needs to your family, particularly your sister. Lastly, we'll review the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique and discuss how you can incorporate it into your daily routine. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds perfect. I'm ready to get started.",
