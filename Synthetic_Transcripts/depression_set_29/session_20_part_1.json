  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you for our 20th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing alright. I've been trying to implement the schedule we created and practice the thought records and coping cards. It's been challenging at times, but I do feel like I'm making progress.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been making progress, Arjun. It's great that you've been practicing the skills we've discussed. Can you tell me more about how the thought records and coping cards have been working for you?\n\nPatient: The thought records have been helpful in catching my negative thoughts and trying to reframe them. I've noticed that I'm starting to do it automatically now, without always needing to write it down. The coping cards have been useful too, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I pull them out and read through them to remind myself of the strategies we've talked about.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Arjun. It's a great sign that you're starting to internalize the process of reframing your thoughts. And I'm glad the coping cards have been a helpful tool for you in moments of distress. How about the schedule we created? How has that been going?\n\nPatient: The schedule has been a bit more challenging to stick to. I've been trying to balance my job search, family responsibilities, and self-care, but it's not always easy. Some days I feel like I'm just not able to get everything done, and I start feeling guilty for not doing enough.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging it can be to balance all of your responsibilities, Arjun. Remember that it's okay if things don't always go according to plan. What matters is that you're making an effort and being kind to yourself in the process. Let's take a look at your schedule together and see if there are any adjustments we can make to help it feel more manageable for you.\n\nPatient: That would be really helpful, Nova. I think I just need some guidance on how to prioritize things better.\n\nTherapist: Of course, we can definitely work on that together. Before we dive into that, let's set an agenda for our session today. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to review my Positive Data Log and talk more about my new core belief, \"I am good enough.\" I also want to discuss how I can continue to balance everything and manage my feelings of guilt when I can't get everything done.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Arjun. We can start by reviewing your Positive Data Log and discussing your progress with your new core belief. Then we can explore strategies for managing guilt and balancing your responsibilities. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds perfect, Nova. I'm ready to get started.",
