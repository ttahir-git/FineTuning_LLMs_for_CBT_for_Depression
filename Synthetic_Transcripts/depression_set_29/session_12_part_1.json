  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the coping strategies we discussed, like the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise and scheduling self-care activities. It hasn't been easy, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and overall well-being. However, I still struggle with feelings of guilt when I prioritize self-care over my family responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the coping strategies and noticing some improvements in your mood. It's also important that you're aware of the challenges you're facing, such as the guilt around self-care. We can definitely explore that further in today's session. Before we set our agenda, can you tell me a bit more about how the thought records and Positive Data Log have been going?\n\nPatient: The thought records have been helpful in identifying and reframing negative thoughts related to self-care and guilt. I've been trying to challenge those thoughts and replace them with more balanced perspectives. The Positive Data Log has been a bit more challenging, as I sometimes struggle to find evidence for the new core belief \"I am good enough.\" I often feel like I'm not doing enough for my family, and that can be tough to shake.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that challenging long-held beliefs can be difficult, especially when they're tied to cultural expectations and family dynamics. The fact that you're recognizing these challenges and continuing to work on reframing your thoughts is a significant step forward. For today's agenda, I suggest we focus on:\n\n1. Reviewing your experience with the homework assignments (5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise, thought records, self-care activities, Positive Data Log)\n2. Exploring the guilt you've been experiencing around self-care and discussing strategies to manage it\n3. Introducing and practicing cognitive restructuring techniques to address negative thoughts and beliefs\n4. Discussing any other challenges or questions that have come up since our last session\n\nHow does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?",
