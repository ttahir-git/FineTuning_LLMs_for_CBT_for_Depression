  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or significant experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like cognitive restructuring and assertive communication. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and overall well-being. I had a difficult conversation with my father about needing more time for self-care, and while it wasn't easy, I felt a bit more empowered afterward.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. Having that difficult conversation with your father shows a lot of courage and progress in asserting your needs. Let's make sure to discuss that further today.\n\nFor our agenda, I'd like to review your homework, continue practicing CBT techniques for managing negative thoughts and feelings, explore additional coping strategies for work and family stress, and discuss any challenges or questions that arose during the week. We'll also continue working on reframing core beliefs and building self-compassion. Does this sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I'd also like to discuss how I can better manage my time and energy for self-care activities. I often feel guilty for taking time for myself when there's so much to do for my family.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss strategies for managing time and energy for self-care, and addressing the guilt that comes up around prioritizing your own needs. It's a common challenge, and we can work on finding a balance that feels right for you.\n\nLet's start by reviewing your homework. How did you find practicing cognitive restructuring and assertive communication? What came up for you as you worked on thought records and added to your Positive Data Log?",
