  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job of identifying and reframing a common cognitive distortion, the \"should statement.\" As we continue practicing this skill, it will become easier to catch those thoughts in the moment and challenge them. I'd like to introduce another tool that can help with this - coping cards. Coping cards are like little reminders of the adaptive thoughts and strategies we've been working on. They can be especially helpful in moments when you're feeling overwhelmed or caught up in negative thoughts.\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. How do I create a coping card?\n\nTherapist: It's simple! You can use index cards or even notes on your phone. On one side, write down a common negative thought or belief that you struggle with. On the other side, write a more balanced or adaptive thought to replace it. For example, on one side you could write \"I should be doing something more productive right now.\" On the other side, you could write \"It's okay to take breaks for self-care sometimes, because it actually helps me show up better for my family and my job search in the long run.\"\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I can keep them with me and pull them out when I need a reminder.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! It's a way to have a little \"pocket therapist\" with you, reminding you of the skills you've learned. Let's practice creating a few more coping cards based on the thoughts and beliefs we've been working on. What's another negative thought that comes up for you often?\n\nPatient: I often think \"I'm not doing enough to support my family.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, what could be a more balanced thought to replace that?\n\nPatient: Maybe \"I'm doing the best I can with the resources I have, and that's enough.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe! It acknowledges your efforts while also recognizing your limitations. Let's create a coping card with that thought. What's another negative thought that comes up for you?\n\nPatient: I sometimes think \"I'll never find a better job.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a common fear, especially when you're in the midst of a challenging job search. What could be a more balanced thought to replace that?\n\nPatient: Maybe \"Job searching is a process, and it takes time. Every application and interview is a step closer to finding the right fit.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe! It acknowledges the challenge of the process while also recognizing the progress you're making. Let's create a coping card with that thought. As you continue practicing these skills and using tools like coping cards, it will become easier to catch and reframe negative thoughts in the moment.",
