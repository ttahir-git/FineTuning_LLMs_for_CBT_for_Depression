  "transcript": "Patient: I think those strategies could work for me. I like the idea of setting aside specific times for my job search and scheduling my other responsibilities around that. And I know I need to communicate more with my family about what I need.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Arjun. Learning to prioritize tasks and communicate your needs are important skills that can help you manage stress and prevent feeling overwhelmed. Why don't we practice creating a sample schedule together? We can start with your job search and then add in your family responsibilities and self-care activities.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. I think I could set aside two hours each morning for my job search, before I start taking care of my mom.\n\nTherapist: That's a great start. Two hours each morning for your job search. Now, let's add in your family responsibilities. When do you typically help your mom and siblings?\n\nPatient: I usually help my mom in the afternoon, after I've finished my job search. And I help my siblings with their homework in the evening, after dinner.\n\nTherapist: Alright, so we have job search in the morning, helping your mom in the afternoon, and helping your siblings in the evening. Now, where can we fit in some self-care activities?\n\nPatient: I could probably take a short break for myself in the late afternoon, before I start helping my siblings. Maybe I could go for a walk or do some stretching.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Arjun. Taking a break for physical activity can help you recharge and manage stress. Let's add that to your schedule. Now, we have a basic outline of your day, with dedicated time for your job search, family responsibilities, and self-care. How does that feel?\n\nPatient: It feels good to have a plan. I think having a schedule will help me feel more in control and less overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Arjun. Remember, this schedule is just a starting point. You can always adjust it as needed, based on your family's needs and your own self-care needs. The important thing is to prioritize your tasks and communicate with your family about your schedule.\n\nPatient: I understand. I'll try to stick to this schedule and see how it goes. I know it might take some time to adjust, but I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Arjun. Remember, change takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate your successes along the way. Speaking of successes, let's take a moment to review your Positive Data Log. Have you been able to gather any new evidence for your new core belief, \"I am good enough\"?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. I had a small success this week that made me feel good about myself. I helped my younger brother with a difficult math problem, and he told me that I explained it really well. It made me feel like I am capable of helping others and that I have valuable skills to offer.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example, Arjun. Helping your brother and receiving positive feedback is great evidence that you are good enough. Let's add that to your Positive Data Log. Remember, the more evidence you gather, the stronger your new core belief will become.",
