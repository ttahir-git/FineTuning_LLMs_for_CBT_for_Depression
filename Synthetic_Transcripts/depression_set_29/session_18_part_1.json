  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the coping strategies we discussed, but it's been challenging. I reached out to my professor, but I haven't heard back yet. I'm feeling a bit discouraged and overwhelmed with everything going on.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why you might be feeling discouraged and overwhelmed. It's great that you reached out to your professor, even though you haven't heard back yet. Let's explore what's been most challenging for you since our last session. What specific thoughts or feelings have been coming up for you?\n\nPatient: I've been struggling with the thought that I'm not doing enough to support my family. Even though I know logically that I need to prioritize self-care, it's hard to shake the guilt. I feel like I should be spending every spare moment either working or helping my family.\n\nTherapist: That's a common struggle for many people, especially when they come from a culture that values family and self-sacrifice. The guilt you're experiencing is a normal response to these conflicting values. Let's take a closer look at this thought: \"I should be spending every spare moment either working or helping my family.\" What do you think might be the consequence of holding onto this belief?\n\nPatient: I guess the consequence is that I end up neglecting my own needs and burning out. It's not sustainable in the long run, and it actually makes it harder for me to support my family effectively.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. When we neglect our own needs, we can end up feeling depleted and resentful, which can strain our relationships and make it harder to show up for the people we care about. What might be a more balanced thought to replace the one you mentioned?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"It's okay to prioritize self-care sometimes, because it actually helps me show up better for my family in the long run.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe! It acknowledges the importance of self-care while still honoring your values around family. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I'd like to talk more about how to balance my family responsibilities with self-care. I also want to discuss my job search and how to stay motivated despite the setbacks.\n\nTherapist: Those are both important topics. Let's start with balancing family responsibilities and self-care, and then we can move on to discussing your job search. As we work through these topics, we'll continue practicing the CBT techniques we've been using, like thought records and cognitive restructuring. We'll also introduce some new tools, like coping cards and meta-thought records, to support you as we move towards the end of our sessions together. How does that sound?",
