  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've been providing me. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise and cognitive restructuring. I've noticed some improvement in my mood, but I'm still struggling with feelings of guilt around self-care and prioritizing my own needs.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvement in your mood. It's understandable that feelings of guilt around self-care and prioritizing your own needs are still present. These beliefs can be deeply ingrained and take time to shift. Let's make sure to address this during our session today. How about we start by setting an agenda? What would you like to focus on in our time together?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to discuss strategies for managing the guilt I feel around self-care. I also want to talk about how I can better communicate my needs to my family without feeling like I'm being selfish. And maybe we could review the cognitive restructuring technique, as I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today, Arjun. Let's start with discussing strategies for managing the guilt around self-care, then move on to communication skills for expressing your needs to your family, and finally, we'll review the cognitive restructuring technique to ensure you feel confident in applying it. Does this agenda work for you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I'm hoping to gain some clarity and tools to help me navigate these challenges.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. Let's begin with the guilt you experience around self-care. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and feelings that come up for you when you prioritize your own needs?\n\nPatient: Well, whenever I take time for myself, like going to dance class or playing video games, I feel like I'm being selfish and neglecting my responsibilities to my family. I think about how hard my father works and how much my mother needs my help, and I feel guilty for not being there for them.\n\nTherapist: It's common for people with strong family values to experience guilt when prioritizing their own needs, especially when they're used to putting others first. The thoughts you're having about being selfish and neglecting your responsibilities are likely contributing to these feelings of guilt. Let's explore this further. Can you identify any cognitive distortions in these thoughts?",
