  "transcript": "Patient: I feel like we've covered a lot of ground today. It's been helpful to talk about everything that's been going on, even if it's not always easy.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're finding our conversation helpful, Arjun. It takes courage to open up about difficult experiences and emotions. I want to assure you that this is a safe space, and we can take things at a pace that feels comfortable for you. Earlier, you mentioned that dancing has been a helpful coping mechanism for you. I'm curious if you've tried any other strategies to manage your stress or depressive symptoms in the past, such as therapy or other treatments?\n\nPatient: I've never been to therapy before this. Like I said, mental health isn't something we really talk about in my family or community. I've always just tried to push through on my own. But I have tried a few other things, like meditation and yoga. I read that they can be good for stress and depression. They help a little, but it's hard to find time to be consistent with them.\n\nTherapist: It's good that you've been proactive in trying different strategies to manage your mental health, Arjun. Meditation and yoga can indeed be helpful for reducing stress and improving overall well-being. Consistency can be challenging, especially with a busy schedule like yours, but even short, regular practices can make a difference. As we continue working together, we can explore ways to incorporate these and other coping strategies into your daily routine in a way that feels manageable for you. You also mentioned attending a support group for single parents. How has that experience been for you in terms of finding support and understanding?\n\nPatient: The support group has been a mixed experience. On one hand, it's good to know that I'm not alone in what I'm going through. It's helpful to hear from other people who are dealing with similar challenges. But on the other hand, I sometimes feel like I don't fit in there. Most of the other people in the group are older than me, and they're all parents. I'm not a parent, I'm a caregiver for my mom and my siblings. It's a different kind of responsibility, and sometimes I feel like people don't really understand that.\n\nTherapist: It's valid to feel that way, Arjun. While there may be similarities in the challenges faced by single parents and caregivers, there are also unique aspects to your situation that might make it difficult to fully relate to others in the group. It's important that you feel understood and supported, both in group settings and in your personal relationships. As we continue our work together, we can explore additional sources of support that may be more aligned with your specific needs and experiences. I'm also interested in learning more about your family dynamics and how they impact your mental health. Can you tell me a bit more about your relationships with your parents and siblings?\n\nPatient: My family is really important to me. We're close, but it can also be a lot of pressure sometimes. My dad works long hours, so he's not around much. When he is home, he's usually pretty tired and stressed out. My mom is the one who really holds everything together, but since she got sick, it's been hard for her to keep up with everything. That's why I've had to step up and take on more responsibility. I love my siblings, but it's not easy being the oldest. I feel like I have to set a good example for them and make sure they're doing okay in school and everything. It's just a lot to handle sometimes.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you have a lot of love and dedication for your family, Arjun, but it's also clear that the weight of these responsibilities is taking a toll on your mental health. It's common for oldest children in immigrant families to feel a sense of obligation to support and care for their siblings and parents, but it's important to remember that you also need support and care yourself. As we move forward in our work together, we'll focus on finding ways for you to balance your family responsibilities with your own needs and well-being. I want to acknowledge the strength and resilience you've shown in navigating these challenges, and I'm here to support you in developing additional tools and strategies to manage your stress and improve your mental health. How are you feeling about what we've discussed so far today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a little overwhelmed, to be honest. It's a lot to think about, and I'm not sure where to start. But I'm also feeling hopeful. It's good to know that I'm not alone in this, and that there are things I can do to feel better. I'm ready to keep working on this.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed when facing big challenges, Arjun. Remember that you don't have to do everything at once, and you don't have to do it alone. We'll take things one step at a time, and we'll work together to find strategies that feel manageable and sustainable for you. I'm glad you're feeling hopeful and ready to continue this work. Your openness and willingness to engage in this process are key strengths that will support your progress. In our next session, we'll continue to explore your experiences and develop a personalized plan for moving forward. For now, I'd like to encourage you to practice some of the coping strategies we've discussed, such as dancing, meditation, or yoga, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. Remember that self-care is an important part of managing stress and maintaining your mental health. If you're comfortable, I'd also like to invite you to share a bit more about your cultural background and how it influences your perspective on mental health and seeking support.",
