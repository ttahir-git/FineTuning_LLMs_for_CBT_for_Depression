  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share an example of a negative thought I struggled with. A few days ago, I was feeling really overwhelmed with taking care of my mom and helping my siblings with their homework. I had the thought, \"I'm not doing enough for my family. I'm failing them.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Arjun. Let's work through this thought together using the thought record. First, let's identify the emotions you were feeling and their intensity when you had this thought.\n\nPatient: I was feeling guilty, overwhelmed, and sad. The guilt was probably at an 8 out of 10, the overwhelm at a 7, and the sadness at a 6.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have the emotions and their intensities. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm not doing enough for my family. I'm failing them.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I feel like I should be doing more to help my mom with her medical needs, and I often feel like I'm not patient enough when helping my siblings with their homework. I see how tired my dad is after working long hours, and I feel like I should be able to take on more responsibilities to lighten his load.\n\nTherapist: I understand why you might feel that way. Now, let's look for evidence against this thought. What are some things that might suggest you are doing enough for your family?\n\nPatient: I guess I do spend a lot of time caring for my mom, making sure she takes her medications and gets to her appointments. I also help my siblings with their homework every day, even when I'm tired. And I'm working to financially support the family, so I am contributing in that way as well.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you're able to recognize those things. It shows that you are, in fact, doing a lot for your family. Now, let's come up with an alternative thought that takes into account both the evidence for and against the original thought. What might be a more balanced way of looking at this situation?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I'm doing the best I can to support my family, even if I can't do everything I'd like to. I'm contributing in meaningful ways, and that's enough.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges your efforts and the reality of the situation without being overly critical of yourself. Now, let's re-rate the emotions you were feeling based on this new thought.\n\nPatient: With this new perspective, I'd say the guilt is now at a 4 out of 10, the overwhelm at a 5, and the sadness at a 4.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in the intensity of those emotions. This shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing how we feel. By challenging negative thoughts and finding more balanced alternatives, we can change how we feel about a situation.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just need to practice this more so that it becomes easier to do in the moment.",
