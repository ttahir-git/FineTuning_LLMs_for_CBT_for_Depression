  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the coping strategies we discussed for managing work-related stress. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some improvement in my ability to handle stressful situations. However, I've also been feeling a bit overwhelmed with my family responsibilities and the pressure to find a better job.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on implementing the coping strategies we discussed, and that you've noticed some improvement in managing work-related stress. It's also important that we address the challenges you're facing with your family responsibilities and job search. Let's make sure to include these topics in our agenda for today's session. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'd also like to discuss how I can communicate better with my family about my needs and emotions. I often feel guilty for prioritizing my own well-being over my family's needs.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely include communication with your family as part of our agenda. It's essential to find a balance between caring for your loved ones and prioritizing your own mental health. We can explore ways to communicate your needs effectively while considering your cultural values and family dynamics. Here's what I have for our agenda so far:\n1. Review homework and progress\n2. Discuss challenges with family responsibilities and job search\n3. Explore communication strategies with family\n4. Continue practicing CBT techniques for managing negative thoughts and feelings\nDoes this cover the main points you'd like to focus on today, or is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: That covers everything I wanted to discuss. I think this agenda will be really helpful for me.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your homework from the last session. How did you find using the thought records and Positive Data Log? Were you able to implement the worry time technique and mindful breathing exercises during breaks at work?",
