  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Arjun, it's great to see you again for session 16. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to start by acknowledging my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week, but I've been trying to apply the techniques we've discussed. I've been using the thought records and Positive Data Log, and I've noticed some improvements in my mood. However, I still struggle with feelings of guilt when I take time for myself.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed and noticing some improvements in your mood. It's also important that you've identified the ongoing challenge of guilt around self-care. Let's explore that further today. How would you feel about setting an agenda for our session? We could prioritize discussing your experiences with self-care and guilt, as well as reviewing your homework and any other topics you'd like to address.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'd also like to discuss some challenges I've been facing at work and how they've been affecting my mood.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely include that in our agenda. So, our priorities for today's session will be:\n1. Reviewing your homework and progress with thought records and the Positive Data Log\n2. Discussing your experiences with self-care and feelings of guilt\n3. Exploring the challenges you've been facing at work and their impact on your mood\n4. Identifying any additional coping strategies that may be helpful\n\nDoes this agenda work for you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers everything. Let's start with reviewing my homework.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's begin by discussing your experiences with the thought records and Positive Data Log. Can you share some examples of thoughts you've identified and how you've worked on reframing them?",
