  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, there was a situation last week where a colleague asked me to take on some extra work. I already had a full plate, but I felt guilty saying no. I ended up staying late at the office to get it all done.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's break this down and see if we can identify the thoughts and beliefs that made it difficult for you to set a boundary in that situation. What was going through your mind when your colleague asked for help?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"If I don't help, they'll think I'm not a team player. I don't want to let anyone down.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts reveal some beliefs about what it means to be a good colleague and the consequences of setting boundaries. Let's explore those beliefs a bit further. What do you think it means to be a \"team player\"?\n\nPatient: I guess I've always believed that being a team player means always being available to help, no matter what. That if I say no, I'm not pulling my weight.\n\nTherapist: That's a common belief, but it's not necessarily true. Being a team player can also mean communicating openly about your capacity and ensuring that you're able to fulfill your own responsibilities. Saying no when you're already at capacity is actually a way of respecting your colleagues and the team's overall goals.\n\nPatient: I never thought about it that way. I guess I've been operating under this belief that I always have to say yes, even if it means sacrificing my own well-being.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. This belief may be contributing to your difficulty setting boundaries. Let's see if we can reframe this belief in a more balanced way. What would be a more helpful way to think about being a team player?\n\nPatient: Maybe being a team player means being honest about what I can and can't take on, and trusting that my colleagues will understand. It's about working together in a sustainable way, not just always saying yes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe. Being a team player is about collaboration and open communication, not about sacrificing your own needs. How do you think this new perspective could help you set boundaries more effectively?\n\nPatient: I think it would help me feel less guilty about saying no. If I reframe it as being honest and collaborative, rather than letting people down, it might be easier to set those limits.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Reframing the meaning of setting boundaries can make it feel less threatening and more manageable. Another helpful strategy is to practice assertive communication. This means expressing your needs clearly and directly, while also respecting the needs of others. How comfortable do you feel with assertive communication?\n\nPatient: It's something I struggle with. I often find myself being passive, rather than assertive. I'm not sure how to phrase things in a way that feels direct but still respectful.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge. One helpful formula for assertive communication is to use \"I\" statements. This means expressing your own feelings and needs, rather than making accusations or demands. For example, instead of saying \"You're asking too much of me,\" you could say \"I'm feeling overwhelmed with my current workload and need to prioritize my existing tasks.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. Using \"I\" statements feels less confrontational and more focused on my own experience.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's a way of expressing your needs without putting the other person on the defensive. Another helpful aspect of assertive communication is to offer alternative solutions when possible. So in the situation with your colleague, you could say something like \"I'm at capacity right now, but I could help you find someone else who might be available.\"\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. Offering an alternative shows that I'm still trying to be helpful, even if I can't take on the task myself.\n\nTherapist: Yes, it's a way of maintaining that collaborative spirit while still setting a clear boundary. As with any new skill, assertive communication takes practice. It might feel uncomfortable at first, but it will get easier over time.\n\nPatient: I'm willing to give it a try. I know that setting boundaries is important for my well-being, and I want to get better at it.\n\nTherapist: That's great. I'm glad you're open to practicing these new strategies. Remember, setting boundaries is a process, and it's okay to take small steps. Even small changes in how you communicate can make a big difference in how you feel.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. This has been really helpful. I feel like I have a better understanding of why setting boundaries is so hard for me, and some concrete strategies to try out.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alex. I'm glad you found this discussion helpful. Remember, we can continue to explore this topic in future sessions and troubleshoot any challenges that come up as you practice these new skills.",
