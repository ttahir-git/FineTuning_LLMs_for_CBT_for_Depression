  "transcript": "Patient: Growing up, my family didn't have a lot of money, and there was always a lot of tension between my parents. I think that's where I learned to keep my feelings to myself and just try to be easy-going, even when things were tough. I've always been the type of person to put on a brave face and help others, but I think that's also made it hard for me to ask for help when I need it.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like your childhood experiences have played a significant role in shaping how you cope with challenges and relate to others. The tendency to put on a brave face and focus on helping others, while admirable, can sometimes make it difficult to prioritize your own needs and emotions. This is something we can explore further in our work together. \n\nI'm also curious about your experience with substance abuse and recovery. How has that journey been for you, and do you feel it's connected to your depression in any way?\n\nPatient: My struggle with alcohol started in my 30s, when I was really stressed with work and taking care of my mom, who had dementia. Drinking was a way to numb out and escape from everything. I've been sober for five years now, but I think the underlying issues that led me to drink are still there. The depression feels like a similar kind of numbness, like I'm just going through the motions.\n\nTherapist: It's common for substance abuse and depression to be interconnected, as they often share underlying causes and can exacerbate one another. Your insight into this connection is an important piece of the puzzle as we work to understand your depression more fully.\n\nYou mentioned that work has been a significant source of stress for you. Can you tell me more about your current work situation and how it's been impacting your mental health?\n\nPatient: I've been at the same company for over 30 years, and I've worked my way up to a managerial position. The long hours and high-pressure environment have always been tough, but lately, it feels like it's getting harder and harder to keep up. I feel like I'm not performing as well as I used to, and that just adds to the stress and feelings of inadequacy.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like your work environment has been a chronic source of stress, and the demands of your role are taking a toll on your mental well-being. This is a common experience for many people, and it's something we can work on together in therapy. \n\nGiven what you've shared about your background and current challenges, I'm starting to get a clearer picture of the factors that may be contributing to your depression. Before we move on, I want to check in with you - how are you feeling about what we've discussed so far? Does anything stand out to you or resonate with your experience?",
