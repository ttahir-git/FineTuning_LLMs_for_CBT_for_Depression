  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted friend or family member. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please let me know if there's anything important I might be missing. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being transparent about your capabilities. I'm comfortable continuing our work together.\n\nTherapist: Great, I appreciate your understanding. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been feeling a bit better. I've noticed some improvement in my mood and motivation, especially when I challenge my negative thoughts. However, I'm still struggling with rumination and pushing through the initial anxiety when it comes to setting boundaries at work.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've noticed some improvements in your mood and motivation. It's also important that you're aware of the ongoing challenges with rumination and setting boundaries. We can definitely explore those further today. Before we set our agenda, is there anything else you'd like to share about your experiences since our last session?\n\nPatient: Not much else to report. I've been trying to practice the techniques we've discussed, like progressive muscle relaxation and thought records, but it's still a work in progress.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, it takes time and practice to integrate these techniques into your daily life. I appreciate your honesty about the challenges you're facing. Let's go ahead and set our agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to:\n\n1. Review your homework from the previous session, including your experiences with progressive muscle relaxation, thought records, and your positive data log.\n2. Explore the challenges you're facing with rumination and setting boundaries at work, and discuss strategies to address these issues.\n3. Introduce the concept of cognitive distortions and how they might be contributing to your negative thought patterns.\n4. Discuss potential ways to expand your support system, both within and outside of work.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything you'd like to add or change?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think those topics cover the main areas I've been struggling with lately.",
