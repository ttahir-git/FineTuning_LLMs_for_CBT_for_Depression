  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you sharing those distress tolerance techniques. I'm definitely going to try them out this week and see how they work for me.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find them helpful. Remember, practice is key. The more you practice these techniques, the more effective they become in managing overwhelming emotions. Now, let's take a step back and explore how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, particularly in the context of setting boundaries at work. Can you think of a recent situation where you struggled with setting boundaries, and walk me through your thoughts and feelings in that moment?\n\nPatient: Well, just last week, my manager asked me to take on an additional project, even though I'm already working on several others. My initial thought was, \"I can't say no. If I do, they'll think I'm not a team player.\" I felt anxious and overwhelmed at the prospect of taking on more work, but I also felt guilty for even considering saying no.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. Let's break it down further. The situation was your manager asking you to take on an additional project. Your automatic thought was, \"I can't say no. If I do, they'll think I'm not a team player.\" And the emotions you experienced were anxiety, overwhelm, and guilt. Is that accurate?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\n\nTherapist: Okay, now let's look at how these thoughts and feelings influenced your behavior. What did you end up doing in that situation?\n\nPatient: I ended up agreeing to take on the additional project, even though I knew it would be too much for me to handle.\n\nTherapist: So, your automatic thought, \"I can't say no. If I do, they'll think I'm not a team player,\" led to feelings of anxiety, overwhelm, and guilt, which then influenced your behavior of agreeing to take on the additional project, even though you knew it wasn't the best decision for your well-being. This is a great example of how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. The good news is that by changing our thoughts, we can also change our feelings and behaviors. Let's practice challenging that automatic thought using a thought record. First, let's identify the evidence for and against the thought, \"I can't say no. If I do, they'll think I'm not a team player.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the evidence that supports it is that my manager seemed really stressed and overwhelmed, and I didn't want to add to that. I also know that the company values teamwork and going the extra mile.\n\nTherapist: Okay, those are valid points. Now, let's look at the evidence against this thought. What evidence do you have that challenges the idea that you can't say no, and that if you do, they'll think you're not a team player?\n\nPatient: I suppose the evidence against it is that I'm already working on several projects and putting in a lot of effort. I've also received positive feedback in the past about my work and my contributions to the team. And logically, I know that setting boundaries is important for my well-being and that it doesn't necessarily mean I'm not a team player.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! You've identified some strong evidence against the automatic thought. Now, let's come up with an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence for and against. What could be a more balanced and helpful way of thinking about this situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"It's okay to set boundaries and say no when I need to. Setting boundaries doesn't mean I'm not a team player. I can still contribute to the team while also taking care of my own well-being.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought! It acknowledges the importance of teamwork and contributing to the company, while also recognizing the value of setting boundaries and taking care of yourself. How do you think this alternative thought would impact your feelings and behavior in that situation?\n\nPatient: I think if I had that thought in the moment, I would feel less anxious and guilty about saying no. I might still feel a little uncomfortable, but I think I'd be more likely to set a boundary and communicate my needs assertively.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! By challenging the automatic thought and coming up with a more balanced alternative, you can change the emotions you experience and the actions you take. This is the power of cognitive restructuring. It takes practice, but over time, it becomes easier to catch those automatic thoughts and challenge them in the moment. I encourage you to continue practicing this skill using thought records, particularly in situations where you struggle with setting boundaries at work.",
