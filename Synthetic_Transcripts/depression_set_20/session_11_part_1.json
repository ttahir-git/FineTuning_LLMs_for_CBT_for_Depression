  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like body language or tone of voice. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided so far. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like progressive muscle relaxation and thought records. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and motivation. However, I'm still struggling with work stress and finding it hard to set boundaries and prioritize self-care.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. It's completely normal to face challenges along the way, especially when it comes to managing work stress and prioritizing self-care. Let's make sure to address these concerns during our session today. Before we set our agenda, can you tell me a bit more about how you've been feeling emotionally since our last session?\n\nPatient: Emotionally, I've been feeling a mix of things. There are moments when I feel a bit more hopeful and motivated, especially after challenging my negative thoughts. But there are also times when I feel overwhelmed and anxious, particularly when it comes to work. I've been trying to push through the initial anxiety and engage in activities, but it's not always easy.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to experience a range of emotions, and it's great that you're noticing moments of hope and motivation alongside the challenges. Pushing through anxiety can be difficult, but taking small steps and acknowledging your progress is crucial. Let's work together to find strategies that can help you manage these feelings and build on the improvements you've noticed. For today's agenda, I suggest we:\n\n1. Review your experience with the homework assignments, including progressive muscle relaxation, thought records, and opposite action.\n2. Explore the challenges you've faced with work stress and setting boundaries, and discuss strategies to address these issues.\n3. Introduce the concept of cognitive distortions and how they might be influencing your thoughts and emotions.\n4. Collaboratively develop a new homework plan based on today's discussion.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or focus on during our session today?",
