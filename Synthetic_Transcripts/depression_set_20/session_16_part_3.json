  "transcript": "Patient: I don't have any direct evidence that my worth is dependent on how much I do for others. It's more of a feeling I have. But when I think about it logically, I know that I should be worthy of respect and value regardless of whether I prioritize my own needs at times. It's just hard to internalize that belief.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alex. Recognizing that your worth is not dependent on how much you do for others is an important step in challenging this belief. It's common for our feelings to not always align with what we know logically, and that's where we can use cognitive restructuring to bridge the gap.\n\nLet's look at the evidence for and against the belief that you're not good enough and that you don't deserve respect or value unless you always put others' needs first. What evidence do you have that supports this belief?\n\nPatient: I guess some evidence that supports this belief is that when I do put others' needs first, I often receive praise and validation from them. It feels good to be seen as helpful and reliable. On the other hand, when I prioritize my own needs, I sometimes face pushback or disappointment from others, which reinforces the belief that I'm not good enough unless I'm always putting others first.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point, Alex. It's common for us to seek praise and validation from others, and it can feel good to be seen as helpful and reliable. However, it's important to recognize that other people's reactions don't define your inherent worth or value. Let's look at the evidence against this belief.\n\nWhat are some examples of times when you prioritized your own needs and still felt worthy of respect and value?\n\nPatient: Well, there have been times when I've set boundaries and prioritized my own needs, and although it was uncomfortable at first, I ultimately felt a sense of relief and self-respect. For example, last month I declined a request to work overtime because I had plans with my family. Although my coworker was disappointed, I knew that spending time with my loved ones was important for my well-being, and I didn't let their reaction define my worth.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Alex. It shows that even when you face pushback or disappointment from others, you can still feel worthy of respect and value by prioritizing your own needs. Let's continue to gather evidence against this belief and develop a more balanced perspective.\n\nAnother way to challenge this belief is to consider the consequences of always putting others' needs before your own. What impact does this have on your well-being and relationships?\n\nPatient: When I always put others' needs before my own, I end up feeling exhausted, resentful, and disconnected from myself. I also notice that my relationships can become unbalanced, with me always being the one to give and others always taking. It's not sustainable in the long run, and it ultimately leads to burnout and strained relationships.\n\nTherapist: Those are important insights, Alex. Recognizing the negative consequences of always putting others' needs before your own can help motivate you to set boundaries and prioritize self-care. It's about finding a balance between being helpful and taking care of yourself.\n\nLet's practice reframing this belief in a more balanced way. Instead of \"I'm not good enough and I don't deserve respect or value unless I always put others' needs first,\" what could be a more adaptive belief to hold?\n\nPatient: A more adaptive belief could be \"I am inherently worthy of respect and value, regardless of how much I do for others. It's important to prioritize my own needs and set boundaries in order to maintain my well-being and have healthy relationships. I can be helpful and reliable while also taking care of myself.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframed belief, Alex. It acknowledges your inherent worth, the importance of self-care and boundaries, and the possibility of being helpful while also taking care of yourself. Let's continue to practice challenging the old belief and reinforcing this new, more balanced belief.\n\nAs we discussed earlier, another challenge you've been facing is rumination, especially when trying to fall asleep at night. Can you tell me more about what these ruminative thoughts typically involve?\n\nPatient: When I'm trying to fall asleep, my mind often gets stuck in negative thought patterns. I'll start thinking about something that happened during the day, like a conversation with a coworker or a mistake I made, and I'll replay it over and over in my head, analyzing every detail and beating myself up for not handling it perfectly. I'll also start worrying about future scenarios and catastrophizing potential outcomes. It feels like I can't shut off my brain, and it keeps me up for hours.",
