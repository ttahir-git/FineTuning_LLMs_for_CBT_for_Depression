  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary from our previous session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like progressive muscle relaxation and thought records. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some improvements in my mood and motivation. I still struggle with rumination and setting boundaries at work, though. It's hard to prioritize my own needs when I feel like I should always be putting others first.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, Alex. It's understandable that setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs can be challenging, especially when you have a core belief that you should always put others first. We can definitely explore this further in today's session. Before we do that, let's take a moment to check in on your overall mood and any significant events or changes since our last session.\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. I've had some good days where I feel more hopeful and motivated, but I've also had days where I feel really sad and anxious. I'm still struggling with sleep and fatigue, although the progressive muscle relaxation has helped a bit. Work continues to be a major source of stress, and I find myself withdrawing from social interactions more often than I'd like.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience ups and downs, and it's good that you're noticing some positive changes alongside the challenges. Sleep and fatigue can have a significant impact on mood, so it's important that we continue working on strategies to improve those areas. Regarding work stress and social withdrawal, we can explore how your thoughts and beliefs might be contributing to those patterns. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on setting boundaries at work and challenging the belief that I always need to put others' needs first. It's something that's been on my mind a lot, and I feel like it's holding me back from taking care of myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great topic to focus on, Alex. Setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care are essential for managing stress and improving overall well-being. We can also discuss strategies for building and maintaining a support system, both within and outside of work, as that can be helpful in managing depression. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I know I need to work on building a stronger support system, but it's hard when I feel like I don't want to burden others with my problems.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel that way, but reaching out for support is not a sign of weakness, but rather a strength. We can explore how your thoughts and beliefs about burdening others might be holding you back from seeking support. Let's start by discussing a situation at work where you struggled to set boundaries, and we can work through a thought record together. Can you think of a recent example?",
