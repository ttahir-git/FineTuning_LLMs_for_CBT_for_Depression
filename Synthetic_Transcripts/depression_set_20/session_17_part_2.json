  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I don't have anything else to add right now.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your homework from the last session. Can you share your experiences with using thought records, setting boundaries, and reaching out to a friend?\n\nPatient: Well, I did try to use the thought records a few times when I noticed myself feeling really down or anxious. It was helpful to write out my thoughts and try to challenge them, but sometimes it felt like I was just going in circles. I had trouble coming up with strong evidence against my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: It's common to feel that way when you're first starting to use thought records. Challenging long-held negative beliefs can be difficult, and it takes practice to build that skill. Can you give me an example of a thought you struggled to challenge?\n\nPatient: Sure. I had a thought that \"I'm not good enough at my job, and I'm going to get fired.\" When I tried to find evidence against it, all I could think of were times when I made mistakes or didn't meet a deadline.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that example. It's great that you were able to identify a specific thought to work on. When we're feeling depressed or anxious, it's common for our minds to focus on information that supports our negative beliefs, while filtering out or discounting evidence that contradicts them. This is called the cognitive distortion of \"disqualifying the positive.\"\n\nOne way to challenge this distortion is to intentionally look for evidence that goes against the negative thought. For example, have there been times when you received positive feedback at work, met a deadline, or successfully completed a project? Even small pieces of evidence can help build a more balanced perspective.\n\nPatient: I guess there have been a few times when my boss complimented my work or a coworker thanked me for helping them. But it's hard to remember those moments when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Our emotions can strongly influence what information we pay attention to and remember. That's why it can be helpful to write down positive experiences when they happen, so you have a record to refer back to when you're struggling with negative thoughts.\n\nThis brings us to a new technique I'd like to introduce today, called the \"Positive Data Log.\" The idea is to actively look for and record evidence that supports more balanced or positive beliefs about yourself. For example, you could create a log where you write down any positive feedback, accomplishments, or experiences that challenge your belief that you're not good enough at your job.\n\nWhat do you think about trying this technique over the next week? We can discuss your experiences with it in our next session.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It might help me see things more clearly when I'm feeling down. I'll give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Great! I'm glad you're open to trying the Positive Data Log. Remember, the goal isn't to ignore or dismiss your negative thoughts, but rather to gather a more balanced set of evidence to consider.\n\nNow, let's talk about your experiences with setting boundaries and reaching out to a friend. How did those go?",
