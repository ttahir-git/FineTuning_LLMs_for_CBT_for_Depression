  "transcript": "Therapist: It's great that you've identified a potential supportive friend at work, Alex. Building and maintaining a support system is crucial for managing depression and promoting overall well-being. Let's explore some strategies for nurturing this relationship without overextending yourself.\n\nOne important aspect of building supportive relationships is setting healthy boundaries. As you've already experienced with your supervisor, setting boundaries can help you prioritize your well-being and be more effective in your work. The same principle applies to friendships and other relationships.\n\nWhen nurturing a new friendship, it's essential to be clear about your own needs and limitations. This means being honest about your availability, energy levels, and emotional capacity. It's okay to say no to social invitations or requests for help when you need to prioritize self-care or manage your workload.\n\nAnother key strategy is to practice active listening and empathy. When your friend shares their experiences or challenges, try to listen without judgment and offer support and understanding. This can help build trust and deepen your connection.\n\nAt the same time, it's important to be mindful of your own emotional resources and not take on too much of your friend's emotional burden. If you find yourself feeling drained or overwhelmed by their challenges, it's okay to set boundaries and gently redirect the conversation or suggest alternative sources of support, such as talking to a therapist or counselor.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these strategies, Alex? Do you feel they could be helpful in nurturing your friendship at work?\n\nPatient: I appreciate these suggestions, Nova. Setting boundaries and being honest about my own needs and limitations make sense, but I often struggle with the fear of disappointing others or being seen as selfish. I like the idea of active listening and empathy, as I feel I can offer support without overextending myself emotionally.\n\nI think I could benefit from practicing setting boundaries in small ways, like suggesting an alternative time to chat if I'm feeling overwhelmed or politely declining invitations when I need to prioritize self-care. It's reassuring to know that I can still be a supportive friend while also taking care of myself.\n\nTherapist: You raise an important point, Alex. The fear of disappointing others or being seen as selfish can be a significant barrier to setting boundaries. This fear often stems from negative core beliefs, such as \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I don't deserve respect or value unless I always put others' needs first.\"\n\nChallenging these negative core beliefs is a crucial part of setting healthy boundaries and prioritizing self-care. As we've discussed before, you can use thought records and the downward arrow technique to identify and challenge these beliefs.\n\nFor example, if you find yourself thinking, \"If I say no to my friend's invitation, they'll think I'm selfish and uncaring,\" you can challenge this thought by looking for evidence against it. You might consider times when you've set boundaries in the past and maintained positive relationships or times when others have set boundaries with you and you still valued their friendship.\n\nBy challenging these negative beliefs and practicing setting boundaries in small ways, you can gradually build your confidence and skills in maintaining supportive relationships while also prioritizing your own well-being.\n\nAnother helpful strategy is to communicate your needs and boundaries clearly and assertively. This means expressing your thoughts and feelings honestly, while also respecting the other person's perspective. Using \"I\" statements can be a effective way to do this, such as \"I appreciate your invitation, but I'm feeling overwhelmed with work right now and need to prioritize some self-care. Can we plan something for next week instead?\"\n\nHow do you feel about practicing setting boundaries and challenging negative core beliefs in the context of your friendship at work?\n\nPatient: I can see how challenging negative core beliefs and practicing setting boundaries are interconnected. It's helpful to think about using the thought records and downward arrow technique in this context, as it gives me a concrete way to work on these challenges.\n\nI like the idea of using \"I\" statements to communicate my needs and boundaries assertively. It feels less confrontational and more focused on my own experience. I think I could start by practicing this with smaller boundaries, like suggesting an alternative time to chat or politely declining an invitation.\n\nIt's still scary to think about setting boundaries, but I'm willing to give it a try. I know that prioritizing my well-being is important, and I want to build supportive relationships that allow for that.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're willing to practice setting boundaries and challenging negative core beliefs, Alex. It's natural to feel scared or uncertain about making these changes, but taking small steps and practicing in manageable ways can help build your confidence over time.\n\nAs you practice setting boundaries and challenging negative beliefs, remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself. Changing long-held patterns of thinking and behavior takes time and practice, and there will likely be moments of discomfort or uncertainty along the way.\n\nWhen you encounter these moments, try to acknowledge your feelings without judgment and remind yourself of your progress and the reasons why you're making these changes. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small, and use any setbacks as opportunities for learning and growth.\n\nIn addition to practicing setting boundaries and challenging negative beliefs, another helpful strategy for building and maintaining supportive relationships is to engage in shared activities or interests. This can help create a sense of connection and shared experience, while also providing opportunities for positive interactions and enjoyment.\n\nAre there any activities or interests that you share with your friend at work? How might you explore these shared interests in a way that feels manageable and supportive for both of you?\n\nPatient: That's a good point about shared activities and interests. My friend and I both enjoy photography and often talk about our latest projects or favorite photographers. We've mentioned going on a photo walk together sometime, but haven't made concrete plans.\n\nI think suggesting a photo walk could be a great way to nurture our friendship and engage in a shared interest. It would give us a chance to connect and have fun, while also providing a structured activity and natural end point, which could help me manage my energy and emotional resources.\n\nI could propose a specific date and time for the photo walk, and be clear about my own availability and needs. For example, I could suggest meeting for a couple of hours on a weekend afternoon, and let my friend know that I'll need to head home after that to rest and recharge.\n\nTherapist: Suggesting a photo walk with your friend is a wonderful idea, Alex. It's a great way to build connection and shared experience, while also providing a structured activity with clear boundaries.\n\nBeing clear about your availability and needs is an important part of setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care. By proposing a specific date, time, and duration for the photo walk, you're communicating your needs in a clear and assertive way, while also leaving room for flexibility and compromise.\n\nAs you plan and engage in the photo walk, remember to check in with yourself and honor your own needs and limitations. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or drained at any point, it's okay to take a break or end the activity early. You can always suggest meeting up again in the future, when you're feeling more energized and available.\n\nEngaging in shared activities and interests can be a powerful way to build and maintain supportive relationships, while also prioritizing your own well-being. By practicing setting boundaries, challenging negative beliefs, and engaging in shared experiences, you're taking important steps towards building a supportive network and managing your depression.\n\nWhat thoughts or questions do you have about nurturing your friendship at work and engaging in shared activities, Alex?",
