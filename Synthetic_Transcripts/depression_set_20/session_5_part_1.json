  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 5. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like challenging cognitive distortions and setting boundaries at work. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and energy levels. However, I'm still struggling with feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and I find it hard to motivate myself to engage in activities I once enjoyed.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we've discussed and that you've noticed some improvements, even if they're small. It's completely normal to still experience feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and to struggle with motivation. These things take time and practice to improve. Let's explore your experiences further. Can you tell me more about the challenges you've faced in setting boundaries at work and engaging in activities you once enjoyed?\n\nPatient: Setting boundaries at work has been difficult because I'm so used to putting others' needs before my own. I feel guilty when I say no or prioritize my own well-being. As for engaging in activities I once enjoyed, I just don't feel the same level of interest or excitement about them anymore. It's like I'm going through the motions, but not really enjoying it.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel guilty when setting boundaries, especially if you're used to prioritizing others' needs. It's important to remember that taking care of yourself is not selfish, but rather a necessary part of maintaining your mental health and well-being. Regarding engaging in activities, it's common for depression to diminish interest and enjoyment in things you once found pleasurable. This is where behavioral activation can be helpful. By scheduling and engaging in activities, even if you don't feel like it, you can start to build momentum and gradually rediscover a sense of enjoyment. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on strategies for setting boundaries at work without feeling guilty and ways to motivate myself to engage in activities, even when I don't feel like it. I'm also interested in learning more about distress tolerance techniques, as you mentioned in the previous session.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan for today's session. We'll discuss strategies for setting boundaries at work, explore ways to motivate yourself to engage in activities, and introduce distress tolerance techniques. Let's start with setting boundaries at work. Can you give me an example of a situation where you struggled to set a boundary?",
