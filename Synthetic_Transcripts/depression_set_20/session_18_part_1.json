  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me so far. I'm feeling a bit low today, to be honest. Work has been stressful, and I've been struggling to keep up with the techniques we've discussed.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Alex. It's normal to have ups and downs throughout this process. Can you tell me more about what's been challenging for you lately?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to use the thought records and Positive Data Log, but I find myself getting caught up in negative thoughts again. It's like I can't break the cycle, and it's affecting my mood and motivation.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging it can be to break out of negative thought patterns. Remember that it takes practice and patience. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a situation where you found it difficult to use the techniques we've discussed?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I received some critical feedback from my supervisor at work. I immediately started thinking that I'm not good enough and that I'll never be able to meet their expectations.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Alex. It's a great opportunity for us to work through it together. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing my negative thoughts, especially in relation to work. I also want to discuss how I can better support myself when I'm feeling low.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on, Alex. I'd also like to review your homework and discuss your progress with the Positive Data Log and worry time. We can work on developing some additional strategies to help you cope with negative thoughts and self-care. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I'm ready to get started.",
