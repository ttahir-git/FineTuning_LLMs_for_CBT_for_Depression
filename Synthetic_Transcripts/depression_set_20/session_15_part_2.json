  "transcript": "Patient: I found the thought records to be quite helpful, especially when I was able to catch myself in the moment of having a negative thought. It was challenging at times to find the evidence against my negative thoughts, but when I did, I noticed a shift in my mood. The Positive Data Log was a bit more difficult for me to maintain consistently, but I did manage to write down a few instances where I felt valued or accomplished something, even if it was small. As for the progressive muscle relaxation, I practiced it a few times, and it did help me feel more relaxed and present in the moment.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you found the thought records helpful, Alex. It's common to struggle with finding evidence against negative thoughts at first, but with practice, it becomes easier to challenge those thoughts and find alternative perspectives. The fact that you noticed a shift in your mood when you were able to do this is a positive sign that you're developing the skills to manage your negative thoughts more effectively.\n\nRegarding the Positive Data Log, even a few instances of noting when you felt valued or accomplished can be significant. It's a start, and we can continue to build on that. The goal is to help you shift your focus from only noticing the negative aspects of your experiences to also acknowledging the positive ones.\n\nI'm glad to hear that the progressive muscle relaxation technique provided some relief and helped you feel more present. As we continue to practice this technique, you may find it becomes easier to relax and manage feelings of anxiety or stress.\n\nLet's take a closer look at one of the thought records you completed since our last session. Can you share an example of a situation where you were able to challenge a negative thought and find evidence against it?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I was asked to take on an additional project at work, even though I was already overwhelmed with my current workload. My initial thought was, \"I can't say no. If I do, my colleagues will think I'm not a team player, and I'll be seen as weak or not dedicated to my job.\" I felt anxious and trapped, like I didn't have a choice in the matter.\n\nUsing the thought record, I challenged this negative thought by looking for evidence against it. I realized that I've successfully completed many projects in the past and have received positive feedback from my colleagues and supervisors. This evidence suggests that even if I say no to this particular project, it doesn't mean I'm not a team player or that I'm weak. I also recognized that setting boundaries and managing my workload is a sign of self-respect and can actually help me be more effective in my role.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent example, Alex. You did a great job of identifying the negative thought, recognizing the emotions it triggered, and then challenging the thought by looking for evidence against it. By examining the evidence, you were able to see that your negative thought wasn't entirely accurate, and you found an alternative perspective that was more balanced and compassionate.\n\nThis is a perfect example of how the thought record can help you challenge negative thoughts and develop more adaptive ways of thinking. It's also a great segue into discussing strategies for setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care, which we had planned to cover today.\n\nBefore we dive into that, let's explore how you felt after completing this thought record. Did you notice any changes in your emotions or your decision regarding the additional project?\n\nPatient: After completing the thought record, I felt a sense of relief and a bit more empowered. I realized that I didn't have to automatically say yes to every request, and that setting boundaries is not a sign of weakness. I decided to have a conversation with my supervisor about my current workload and the new project. I expressed my concerns and explained that I wanted to ensure I could give my best effort to the projects I was already working on.\n\nTo my surprise, my supervisor was understanding and appreciative of my honesty. We discussed the priorities of the various projects, and she agreed that I could focus on my current workload and not take on the new project at this time. It was a huge weight off my shoulders, and I felt like I had taken a step towards prioritizing my well-being.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic outcome, Alex! It's great to hear that you were able to have an open and honest conversation with your supervisor and that she was understanding and supportive. This experience demonstrates the power of challenging negative thoughts and setting boundaries.\n\nBy examining the evidence and considering alternative perspectives, you were able to make a decision that prioritized your well-being and allowed you to be more effective in your work. This is a significant step forward in managing your depression and developing healthier patterns of thinking and behavior.\n\nNow, let's discuss some strategies for building and maintaining a support system, which you mentioned earlier. Can you tell me more about the potential supportive friend you've identified at work?",
