  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 15. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service immediately. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret your non-verbal cues, so I'll be relying on your verbal expressions to understand your thoughts and feelings. With that said, let's start with a check-in. How have you been since our last session? How has your mood been, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've noticed some improvements in my mood, particularly when I actively challenge my negative thoughts using the thought records. However, I still struggle with rumination and pushing through the initial anxiety and negative thoughts when trying to engage in activities or set boundaries at work. I often find myself prioritizing others' needs over my own well-being, which leaves me feeling drained and unfulfilled.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've noticed some improvements in your mood, Alex. It's great that you're finding the thought records helpful in challenging negative thoughts. The struggles you mentioned with rumination, setting boundaries, and prioritizing self-care are common challenges for many people dealing with depression. We can definitely explore these areas further in today's session. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for our time together. Based on what you've shared, I think it might be helpful to discuss your experiences with the homework exercises, explore any new challenges or stressors that have come up since our last session, and work on developing some strategies for setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care. What do you think? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me, Nova. I agree with the topics you've suggested. I'd also like to discuss some strategies for building and maintaining a support system, both within and outside of work. I've identified a potential supportive friend at work, but I'm not sure how to nurture that relationship without overextending myself.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Alex. Building and maintaining a support system is a crucial aspect of managing depression and promoting overall well-being. We can definitely explore some strategies for nurturing supportive relationships while also setting healthy boundaries. To start, let's discuss your experiences with the homework exercises from our last session. How did you find working with the thought records, Positive Data Log, and progressive muscle relaxation technique?",
