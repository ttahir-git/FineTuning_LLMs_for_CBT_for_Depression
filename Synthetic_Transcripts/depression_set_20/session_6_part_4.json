  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up our discussion on setting boundaries, I want to emphasize that learning to set healthy boundaries is a process. It takes time and practice to change long-standing patterns of behavior. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the reminder to be patient. It's easy to get frustrated when I don't see immediate results.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. Change is often gradual, and it's not always linear. There may be setbacks along the way, but that doesn't mean you're not making progress. Every small step counts.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. I guess I just want to feel better as quickly as possible.\n\nTherapist: That's a natural desire, but it's important not to rush the process. Sustainable change takes time. Trust that by consistently practicing these new skills, you will see improvements in your well-being over time.\n\nPatient: I trust you, and I'm committed to doing the work. It's just hard sometimes.\n\nTherapist: I hear you. It takes a lot of courage to face these challenges head-on. Remember to give yourself credit for showing up and doing the best you can each day. That in itself is a huge accomplishment.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the encouragement. It means a lot to have your support through this process.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alex. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Before we end today's session, let's check in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also hopeful. It's a lot to take in, but I feel like I have some new tools to work with.\n\nTherapist: It's normal to feel overwhelmed when you're learning new skills and confronting long-standing patterns. Remember to take things one step at a time and be kind to yourself throughout the process. What's one thing you're taking away from today's session that feels helpful?\n\nPatient: I think the idea of reframing what it means to be a team player is really powerful for me. It shifts the way I think about setting boundaries and makes it feel more acceptable.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Reframing our beliefs can be a powerful catalyst for change. I'm glad that resonated with you. As we wrap up, let's discuss your homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing the distress tolerance techniques we've discussed, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. I'd also like you to try out some of the assertive communication strategies we talked about today, particularly in situations where you need to set boundaries at work. Finally, continue using thought records to challenge automatic thoughts, especially those related to setting boundaries and being a team player. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: It sounds like a solid plan. I'll do my best to practice these skills over the next week.\n\nTherapist: Great. Remember, the goal is not perfection. It's about consistent practice and small steps forward. If you encounter any challenges or have any insights you'd like to share, feel free to bring them to our next session. We can troubleshoot and celebrate your progress together.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your guidance and support. I'm looking forward to our next session.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alex. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences and progress next week. Take care until then.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Reviewed and practiced distress tolerance techniques (5-4-3-2-1 grounding and 4-7-8 breathing)\n- Continued practicing thought records and generating alternative thoughts\n- Explored beliefs and automatic thoughts related to setting boundaries at work\n- Introduced assertive communication strategies and practiced reframing beliefs about being a team player\n- Checked in on patient's current mood and explored final thoughts\n- Assigned homework: practice distress tolerance techniques, use thought records to challenge automatic thoughts related to setting boundaries, and practice assertive communication strategies at work\n- Patient's progress: demonstrated insight and willingness to practice skills, reported feeling more hopeful and equipped to handle emotions, identified helpful reframes related to setting boundaries\n- Patient's challenges: may encounter difficulties with consistency and self-compassion, setting boundaries at work may continue to be challenging\n- Depression symptoms: persistent feelings of sadness and anxiety, some improvement in hopefulness and coping skills\n- Important personal details: history of substance abuse, tendency to prioritize others' needs over own, lack of strong support system\n- Plan for next session: review homework, discuss progress and challenges, continue practicing CBT techniques, explore any new automatic thoughts or cognitive distortions that arise",
