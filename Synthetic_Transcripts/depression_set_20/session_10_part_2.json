  "transcript": "Patient: Progressive muscle relaxation sounds interesting. Can you explain how to do it?\n\nTherapist: Certainly, Alex. Progressive muscle relaxation involves systematically tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body. You start by focusing on your toes and feet, and then work your way up through your legs, torso, arms, and head. \n\nFor each muscle group, you'll tense the muscles for about 5-10 seconds, focusing on the sensation of tension, and then release the tension and focus on the feeling of relaxation for about 15-20 seconds. As you release the tension, you might say a calming word or phrase to yourself, like \"relax\" or \"let go.\"\n\nThe key is to really focus on the contrast between the tension and relaxation, and to breathe slowly and deeply throughout the exercise. Many people find that this helps to release physical tension and promote a sense of calm and relaxation.\n\nPatient: I can see how that might be helpful for getting to sleep. I'll give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Great! It can be helpful to practice progressive muscle relaxation at other times during the day as well, not just at bedtime. The more you practice, the more easily you'll be able to call up that feeling of relaxation when you need it.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and talk about managing work stress. Last session, we discussed some strategies for setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care. How has that been going?\n\nPatient: It's been challenging. I'm so used to putting everyone else's needs before my own, and I worry about letting people down. I have been trying to take breaks when I need them, but I often feel guilty about it.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel guilty, especially when you're used to prioritizing others. But it's so important to remember that taking care of yourself isn't selfish - it's necessary. If you don't take breaks and prioritize your own well-being, you'll eventually burn out and won't be able to help anyone.\n\nOne strategy that can be helpful is to schedule your breaks and self-care activities, just like you would schedule any other important task. That way, you're making a commitment to yourself and you're less likely to skip or postpone your breaks.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I can try putting breaks on my calendar, so I'm less likely to forget or skip them.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And remember, self-care doesn't have to be time-consuming or elaborate. Even a few minutes of deep breathing or a quick walk around the block can make a big difference in your stress levels.\n\nAnother strategy is to practice setting boundaries and saying no when you need to. This can be really difficult, especially if you're used to being a people-pleaser. But it's okay to politely decline requests or invitations if you're feeling overwhelmed or if you need to prioritize your own well-being.\n\nPatient: I definitely struggle with saying no. I always feel like I need to have a really good reason.\n\nTherapist: Many people feel that way. But the truth is, you don't need to justify or explain your reasons for saying no. A simple, polite \"no\" or \"I'm not able to do that right now\" is enough. And if someone pressures you or doesn't respect your boundaries, that's a sign that they may not be a supportive person to have in your life.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I need to work on being more assertive and setting those boundaries.\n\nTherapist: Assertiveness is a skill that takes practice, but it's so worth it. As you start to set and enforce healthy boundaries, you'll likely find that your stress levels decrease and your overall well-being improves.\n\nNow, I'd like to spend some time reviewing your thought records from the past week. Can you share some examples of thoughts you noticed and how you challenged them?",
