  "transcript": "Patient: Setting boundaries has been really hard for me. I feel guilty when I say no to someone, like I'm letting them down. I did try to reach out to a friend, but I ended up canceling our plans at the last minute because I was feeling too anxious.\n\nTherapist: It's common to feel guilty when setting boundaries, especially if you're used to putting others' needs before your own. Remember that setting healthy boundaries is a way of taking care of yourself and ensuring that you have the energy and resources to support others in a sustainable way.\n\nRegarding reaching out to your friend, it's great that you took that initial step, even though you ended up canceling. Can you tell me more about what thoughts and feelings came up for you when you were getting ready to meet your friend?\n\nPatient: I started worrying that I wouldn't be good company, and that my friend would think I'm boring or not fun to be around anymore. I also felt really tired and didn't think I had the energy to go through with our plans.\n\nTherapist: Those are understandable concerns, and it's helpful to identify the specific thoughts and feelings that led to canceling your plans. Let's explore this further using the CBT triangle, which illustrates the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\n\nIn this situation, your thoughts included \"I won't be good company\" and \"My friend will think I'm boring.\" These thoughts likely contributed to feelings of anxiety and perhaps sadness. In response to these thoughts and feelings, you chose to cancel your plans, which is the behavior part of the triangle.\n\nDoes this connection make sense to you? Can you see how your thoughts and feelings influenced your decision to cancel?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see that. It's like my thoughts were telling me that it would be better to avoid the situation, even though part of me wanted to see my friend.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Our thoughts can have a powerful influence on our emotions and actions, even when they're not entirely accurate or helpful. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I won't be good company.\"\n\nWhat evidence do you have that supports this thought? And what evidence do you have that goes against it?\n\nPatient: Evidence that supports it... well, I've been feeling really down lately, and I'm not as energetic or talkative as I used to be. But evidence against it... my friend has been really understanding and supportive in the past, and they know I'm going through a tough time. They probably wouldn't judge me for being a little quiet or low-energy.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. It sounds like you have evidence on both sides of the thought, but the evidence against it suggests that your friend cares about you and would likely be happy to spend time with you, even if you're not feeling 100%.\n\nLet's come up with an alternative thought that takes both sets of evidence into account. What's a more balanced way of looking at this situation?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I might not be as energetic as usual, but my friend cares about me and would still enjoy spending time together.\"\n\nTherapist: I think that's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges your current struggles while also recognizing the value of your friendship and the likelihood that your friend would be understanding.\n\nNow, let's consider how this alternative thought might impact your feelings and behaviors. If you believed this thought, how might you feel and what might you do differently in this situation?\n\nPatient: If I really believed that, I think I would feel less anxious about meeting up with my friend. I might still feel a little nervous, but I'd probably be more likely to go through with our plans instead of canceling.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense. Challenging our negative thoughts and considering alternative perspectives can help shift our emotions and make it easier to engage in behaviors that support our well-being and relationships.\n\nAs we discussed earlier, practicing these skills takes time and repetition. I encourage you to keep using thought records and the CBT triangle to examine your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in challenging situations.\n\nSpeaking of practice, let's revisit the worry time and thought stopping techniques we discussed last session for managing rumination. Can you walk me through how you've been trying to implement these techniques?",
