  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I think it covers the main areas I've been struggling with, especially work stress and setting boundaries.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your experience with the homework assignments. How did you find practicing progressive muscle relaxation?\n\nPatient: It was helpful, especially when I did it before bed. I noticed that I was able to fall asleep a bit easier on the days I practiced. But I struggled to find time to do it during work breaks. I always felt like I had too much to do and couldn't take a break.\n\nTherapist: It's good to hear that progressive muscle relaxation helped with your sleep. Finding time during work can be challenging, but even a few minutes of practice can make a difference. Let's explore some ways to incorporate it into your workday. As for the thought records, how did you find that exercise?\n\nPatient: Challenging my negative thoughts was difficult at first. I found myself getting stuck in the same thought patterns. But when I was able to come up with alternative thoughts, I noticed a shift in my mood. It's just hard to do it consistently.\n\nTherapist: It's normal to find thought records challenging at first. The more you practice, the easier it becomes to identify and challenge negative thoughts. Remember, the goal is not to get rid of negative thoughts completely, but to develop a more balanced perspective. Did you have a chance to engage in any opposite actions?\n\nPatient: I did reach out to my colleague, the one I mentioned last time. We had lunch together, and it was nice to connect with someone at work. I felt a bit less alone in my struggles. But I still find it hard to take opposite actions when it comes to setting boundaries at work.\n\nTherapist: Reaching out to your colleague is a great step! Building connections at work can provide a sense of support and help combat feelings of isolation. Setting boundaries can be more challenging, as it often involves asserting your needs and potentially facing some pushback. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a situation where you struggled to set boundaries at work?\n\nPatient: Just last week, my boss asked me to stay late to finish a project, even though I had already worked overtime earlier in the week. I wanted to say no, but I felt guilty and worried about disappointing him. So, I ended up staying, but I felt resentful and exhausted afterward.\n\nTherapist: That's a difficult situation, and it's understandable to feel guilty and worried about disappointing others. However, consistently putting others' needs before your own can lead to burnout and increased stress. Let's break down this situation using a thought record. What thoughts were going through your mind when your boss asked you to stay late?",
