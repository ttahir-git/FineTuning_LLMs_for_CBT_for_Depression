  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 16. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss today?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've noticed some improvements in my mood and motivation, especially when I challenge my negative thoughts using the thought records. However, I'm still struggling with setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care. I often find myself putting others' needs before my own well-being, and it's taking a toll on me.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've noticed some improvements in your mood and motivation, Alex. It's great that you're finding the thought records helpful in challenging negative thoughts. I understand that setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care continue to be challenges for you. Let's make sure to discuss these topics further today.\n\nBefore we dive in, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize today? We could review your homework, discuss your progress and challenges with setting boundaries, and explore strategies for managing rumination and perfectionism. What stands out to you as most important?\n\nPatient: I think reviewing my homework and discussing my challenges with setting boundaries would be most helpful. I've been trying to use \"I\" statements to communicate my needs, but I often feel guilty or selfish for doing so. I'd also like to talk about rumination, as I find myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns, especially when I'm trying to fall asleep at night.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Alex. We'll start by reviewing your homework and then dive into the challenges you're facing with setting boundaries and rumination. I understand how difficult it can be to prioritize your own needs and break free from negative thought patterns. We'll work together to develop some strategies to help you manage these challenges.\n\nLet's begin with your homework. How did you find the experience of completing thought records, practicing setting boundaries, and reaching out to your friend at work?",
