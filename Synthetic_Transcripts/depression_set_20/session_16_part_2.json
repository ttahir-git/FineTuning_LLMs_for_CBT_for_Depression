  "transcript": "Patient: I found the thought records to be really helpful in challenging my negative thoughts. It was eye-opening to see how often I engage in black-and-white thinking and how it contributes to my low mood. However, I struggled with setting boundaries using \"I\" statements. I felt guilty and selfish for prioritizing my own needs, and I worried about how others would perceive me.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you found the thought records helpful, Alex. Recognizing patterns of black-and-white thinking is an important step in challenging negative thoughts. Regarding setting boundaries, it's common to feel guilty or selfish at first, especially if you're used to putting others' needs before your own. Let's explore this further.\n\nCan you give me an example of a situation where you tried to set a boundary using \"I\" statements, and what thoughts and emotions came up for you?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, my coworker asked me to cover their shift on Saturday, even though I had already made plans to spend time with my family. I tried to use an \"I\" statement and said, \"I appreciate you asking, but I already have plans with my family this weekend, and it's important for me to spend time with them.\" However, I felt guilty for saying no and worried that my coworker would think I'm not a team player.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Alex. It's understandable to feel guilty and worried about others' perceptions when setting boundaries, especially if you're used to prioritizing others' needs. Let's take a closer look at the thoughts and emotions that came up for you in this situation.\n\nWhat do you think was the underlying belief that contributed to your feelings of guilt and worry?\n\nPatient: I think the underlying belief is that I'm not good enough and that I don't deserve respect or value unless I always put others' needs first. I feel like if I say no or set boundaries, I'll be seen as weak or not dedicated, and I'll face negative consequences.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alex. This belief that you're not good enough and that you don't deserve respect or value unless you always put others' needs first is a common core belief that can contribute to difficulty setting boundaries. Let's explore this further using the downward arrow technique.\n\nIf you believe that you're not good enough and that you don't deserve respect or value unless you always put others' needs first, what do you think that means about you as a person?\n\nPatient: If I believe that, it means that my worth is dependent on how much I do for others and that I'm not inherently valuable or worthy of respect. It also means that I have to be perfect and never let anyone down, or else I'm a failure.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alex. This belief that your worth is dependent on how much you do for others and that you have to be perfect is a common intermediate belief that can contribute to difficulty setting boundaries. Let's challenge this belief using some Socratic questioning.\n\nWhat evidence do you have that your worth is dependent on how much you do for others? Is it possible to be worthy of respect and value even if you prioritize your own needs at times?",
