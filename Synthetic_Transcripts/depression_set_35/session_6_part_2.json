  "transcript": "Patient: I found the thought records to be a helpful tool for identifying and challenging my negative thoughts. However, I struggled with coming up with alternative thoughts that I truly believed. I felt like I was just going through the motions sometimes. The deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation techniques were more effective for me in managing my stress and anxiety in the moment.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're finding the deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation helpful for managing stress and anxiety. Regarding the thought records, it's common to feel like you're just going through the motions at first. Challenging long-held beliefs takes time and practice. Let's look at one of the thought records you completed this week. Can you share an example of a negative thought you struggled to challenge?\n\nPatient: Sure. I had a thought that \"I'm a failure because I haven't been able to find a new job.\" I tried to come up with alternative thoughts, like \"I'm just going through a rough patch\" or \"My worth isn't defined by my job status,\" but they didn't feel very convincing.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that example, Jin-Soo. When we've held onto a belief for a long time, it can be difficult to believe alternative thoughts at first. One strategy is to look for evidence that supports the alternative thoughts. For example, can you think of times in your life when you've overcome challenges or achieved success, even if they weren't related to your job?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose graduating from my doctoral program and building a successful career in the first place are examples of times I've achieved success. And I've been able to develop my gardening skills and contribute to the community gardening group, even though that's not related to my job search.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Those are great examples of evidence that support the alternative thoughts. Another strategy is to consider what you would say to a friend who expressed a similar negative thought about themselves. Would you tell them they were a failure, or would you offer a more compassionate perspective?\n\nPatient: I would definitely try to offer a more compassionate perspective to a friend. I might remind them of their strengths and accomplishments, and encourage them to be kind to themselves during a difficult time.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Jin-Soo. Often, we're much harder on ourselves than we would be on others. Try to practice extending that same compassion and understanding to yourself. As we continue with the thought records, keep looking for evidence to support the alternative thoughts and practice treating yourself with the same kindness you would offer a friend.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just hard sometimes, when the negative thoughts feel so automatic and deeply ingrained.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it is hard. And that's why we're practicing these techniques \u2013 to help you build new, more helpful thought patterns over time. Remember that it's a process, and it's okay if it feels challenging at first. In addition to the thought records, another technique that can be helpful for managing distressing emotions is mindfulness. Have you heard of mindfulness before?",
