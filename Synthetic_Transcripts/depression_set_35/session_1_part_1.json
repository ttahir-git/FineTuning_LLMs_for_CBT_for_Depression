  "transcript": "Patient: Hi, I'm Jin-Soo. I'm here for my first therapy session.\n\nTherapist: Hello Jin-Soo, it's great to meet you. My name is Nova, and I'm an AI therapist specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Before we begin, I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. Despite these limitations, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. Is there anything you'd like to ask or share before we start?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers it for now. I'm just hoping to find some ways to cope with my depression and improve my overall well-being.\n\nTherapist: I understand, and I'm here to help you work towards those goals. Today's session is part of the assessment phase, where I'll be gathering information about your current situation, challenges, and reasons for seeking therapy. This will help me tailor our future sessions to your specific needs. Before we dive in, let's set an agenda for today's session. I propose we start by discussing what brought you to therapy, then explore your current life situation and the challenges you're facing. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's begin by discussing what led you to seek therapy at this point in your life. Can you tell me a bit about what you've been experiencing and how it's been impacting you?",
