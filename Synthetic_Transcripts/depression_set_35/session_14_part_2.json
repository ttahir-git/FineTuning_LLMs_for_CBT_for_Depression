  "transcript": "Patient: I'm ready to get started. Should we begin with reviewing my homework?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, let's start there. How did you find the experience of keeping a positive data log and applying to jobs over the past week?\n\nPatient: It was challenging, but also eye-opening in some ways. I managed to apply to three jobs, like we agreed, but I noticed that I kept getting stuck in negative thought patterns while doing it. The positive data log helped me see that I have more strengths and accomplishments than I usually give myself credit for.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jin-Soo. Can you share an example of a negative thought pattern that came up during the job application process?\n\nPatient: Well, I caught myself thinking things like \"They're going to reject me anyway, so why bother?\" and \"I'm not as qualified as the other applicants.\" It was hard to push through those thoughts and submit the applications.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that. Those thoughts are great examples of cognitive distortions, specifically fortune-telling and disqualifying the positive. Recognizing these patterns is an important step in challenging them. Let's explore one of these thoughts using the downward arrow technique to uncover any underlying beliefs. Are you willing to try that with me?\n\nPatient: Sure, I'm willing to give it a shot.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's start with the thought \"I'm not as qualified as the other applicants.\" If that were true, what would it mean to you?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not good enough for the job.\n\nTherapist: And if you're not good enough for the job, what would that mean about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm a failure, that I can't succeed in my career.\n\nTherapist: And if you're a failure in your career, what would that mean about your life in general?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not living up to my potential, that I'm disappointing myself and others.\n\nTherapist: I see. It seems like this thought is connected to a deeper belief that your worth is tied to your professional success. Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess it does. I've always put a lot of pressure on myself to excel in my career.\n\nTherapist: That's a common belief, and it can be a heavy burden to carry. Let's work on reframing that belief using some of the evidence from your positive data log. Can you share a few entries that challenge the idea that your worth is solely based on your professional success?",
