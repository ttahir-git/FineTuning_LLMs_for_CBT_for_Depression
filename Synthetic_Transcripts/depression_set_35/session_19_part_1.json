  "transcript": "Here is part 1 of 4 for session 19 of CBT for depression with Dr. Jin-Soo Park:\n\nTherapist: Hello Jin-Soo, it's great to see you today for our 19th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing relatively well. I've continued practicing the thought records, behavioral experiments, and updating my Positive Data Log. I've also started creating my personal \"toolbox\" of CBT skills, which has been helpful in reinforcing what I've learned so far. However, I've noticed that I still struggle with self-doubt and anxiety at times, especially when it comes to my job search.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been consistently practicing the CBT techniques we've discussed and that you've started creating your personal \"toolbox.\" It's also important that you're aware of the ongoing challenges you face with self-doubt and anxiety. Let's make sure to address these concerns during today's session. Before we set our agenda, could you share a bit more about how your mood has been in general since our last session?\n\nPatient: Overall, my mood has been more stable compared to when we first started therapy. I've been feeling more hopeful and confident in my ability to manage my thoughts and emotions. However, there are still moments when I feel overwhelmed by the uncertainty of my future and the pressure I put on myself to succeed. These feelings sometimes trigger my negative core belief that \"I'm not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Jin-Soo. It's common to experience setbacks and challenges even as you make progress in therapy. The fact that you're able to recognize these moments and the thoughts that accompany them is a sign of your growing self-awareness. Today, let's focus on strategies to help you cope with the uncertainty and pressure you're experiencing, as well as continuing to challenge your negative core belief. What else would you like to prioritize in our session today?\n\nPatient: I would like to discuss how I can better manage my anxiety related to my job search and explore ways to maintain my progress after our therapy sessions come to an end. I'm also interested in learning more about relapse prevention planning, as you mentioned in our last session.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. Let's add managing job search anxiety, maintaining progress post-therapy, and relapse prevention planning to our agenda. We'll also continue to work on challenging your negative core belief throughout our discussion. To start, let's explore your experience with job search anxiety. Can you tell me about a recent situation that triggered these feelings?",
