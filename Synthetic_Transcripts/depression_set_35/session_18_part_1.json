  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jin-Soo, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say, as I can't directly observe non-verbal cues. I also want to remind you that if you ever experience a mental health crisis or need emergency services, I'm not equipped to provide that level of support, and it's crucial to reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services in your area.\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. I feel comfortable continuing our sessions with this in mind.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for your understanding, Jin-Soo. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been feeling a bit more hopeful and motivated since our last session. I've been trying to apply the cognitive and behavioral experiments we discussed, especially when it comes to my job search. It's still challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making progress.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and motivated, and that you've been applying the techniques we've discussed. Can you share a specific example of how you've used cognitive or behavioral experiments in your job search?\n\nPatient: Well, I created a list of smaller companies to apply to, like we talked about, and I ranked them based on my anxiety and uncertainty levels. I applied to one company that I had ranked as moderately anxiety-provoking, and I tried to focus on the process rather than the outcome.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example of putting the cognitive and behavioral experiments into practice. How did it feel to take that step and focus on the process?\n\nPatient: It was definitely nerve-wracking, but also empowering in a way. I realized that even if I don't get the job, the act of applying and putting myself out there is a success in itself.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! That's a great insight, Jin-Soo. Shifting your perspective to focus on the process and the actions you can control is a powerful way to build resilience and maintain motivation. Let's make a note to discuss your experience with the job application in more detail later in the session.\n\nPatient: Sounds good. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on it.\n\nTherapist: Before we continue, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. We can prioritize discussing your experience with the homework, including the cognitive and behavioral experiment with the job application, as well as exploring any challenges or successes you had with the Positive Data Log and thought records. We should also make time to discuss strategies for managing self-criticism and building more adaptive beliefs. Does that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That covers the main points I wanted to discuss. I'm also wondering if we could touch on how I can start preparing for the end of our sessions, as I know we only have a couple left.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's a great point. We can definitely discuss strategies for maintaining your progress and preparing for the end of our sessions. It's important to start thinking about how you can continue applying the skills you've learned independently and how to access support if needed. Let's add that to the agenda as well.\n\nPatient: Perfect, I appreciate that.\n\nTherapist: So, our agenda for today includes:\n1. Discussing your experience with the homework, focusing on the cognitive and behavioral experiment with the job application.\n2. Exploring challenges and successes with the Positive Data Log and thought records.\n3. Discussing strategies for managing self-criticism and building more adaptive beliefs.\n4. Addressing how to prepare for the end of our sessions and maintain your progress.\n\nLet's start by discussing your experience with the job application experiment. Can you walk me through how you approached it and what thoughts and emotions came up for you during the process?",
