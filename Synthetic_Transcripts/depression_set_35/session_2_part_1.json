  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jin-Soo, it's great to see you again for our second session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to acknowledge that I am an AI therapist, which means I have some limitations. For example, I can only access the information you provide me during our sessions, and I may occasionally generate inaccurate information. Additionally, I am not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever feel that you are in crisis or need immediate assistance, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted friend or family member. With that said, I am here to support you in your journey towards better mental health. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate your transparency. Today, I'm feeling a bit low, to be honest. I've been struggling with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness. I did complete the thought record homework, but it was challenging to identify the triggering situations and emotions at times.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Jin-Soo. It's common to experience difficulties when first starting to identify negative thoughts and their triggers. Would you feel comfortable sharing some of the thoughts you recorded and the situations that triggered them? We can review them together and work on identifying patterns.\n\nPatient: Sure. One recurring thought I noticed was, \"I'm not good enough.\" It seems to come up whenever I think about job applications or interacting with people in my community gardening group. I feel like I don't measure up to their expectations.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jin-Soo. The thought \"I'm not good enough\" is a common negative thought pattern that many people experience. In CBT, we call these types of thoughts \"automatic negative thoughts\" because they often occur spontaneously and without much evidence to support them. I'd like to explore this thought further with you. Would you be open to that?\n\nPatient: Yes, I'd like to understand why I keep having this thought and how to change it.\n\nTherapist: Great. Before we dive in, let's set an agenda for today's session. We can review your thought records, discuss the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and start exploring your specific thought patterns related to your depression. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.",
