  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jin-Soo, it's great to see you again for session 16. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few limitations as your AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about the limitations. I understand. Since our last session, I've been trying to keep up with the positive data log and thought records, but it's been challenging. I attended one meeting of the job search support group, which was helpful, but I still find myself struggling with self-doubt and hopelessness when it comes to finding a job.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Jin-Soo. It's common to face challenges when implementing new strategies, and I'm glad you're sharing your experiences with me. Let's explore your struggles with the job search process further. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my experience with the support group and how it relates to my job search. I also want to discuss some of the negative thoughts that have been coming up recently.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan. We can start by discussing your experience with the support group and then move on to exploring the negative thoughts you've been having. As we go through the session, we'll work on building more adaptive beliefs and coping strategies. How does that sound?",
