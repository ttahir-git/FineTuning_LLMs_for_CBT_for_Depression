  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up our session today, I'd like to introduce one more technique called \"Coping Cards.\" These are small, portable reminders of the adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs you've developed in therapy. You can create these cards by writing down helpful statements on index cards or in a notes app on your phone. The idea is to have them readily available whenever you need a boost or a reminder of your CBT skills.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a great idea. Could you give me an example of what I might write on a coping card?\n\nTherapist: Certainly! One example could be a card that says, \"I am capable and worthy, even when I face challenges or setbacks.\" This reinforces the new core belief we've been working on. Another card might remind you of a helpful CBT technique, like \"When I'm feeling anxious, I can use a thought record to challenge my negative thoughts.\"\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I can keep these cards with me and refer to them when I need a reminder of what I've learned in therapy.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Coping cards are a great way to support yourself after therapy ends. They can help you stay connected to the skills and insights you've gained, even in challenging moments.\n\nBefore we end today's session, I'd like to check in with you about your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling more hopeful and empowered after our discussion today. I know there will still be challenges ahead, but I feel better equipped to handle them. Thank you for all your support and guidance throughout our sessions.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jin-Soo. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and empowered. Remember, the progress you've made is a testament to your hard work and dedication to your well-being. As we approach the end of our therapy sessions, I want to remind you that you have the skills and tools to continue making progress on your own.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the Meta-Thought Records and create some coping cards for yourself. Also, start thinking about your relapse prevention plan and the support systems you can rely on after therapy ends. We'll discuss this further in our next session.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll work on the homework and start thinking about my relapse prevention plan. Thank you again for everything.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jin-Soo. I look forward to our next session and hearing about your progress. Take care until then.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Managing job search anxiety, preparing for the end of therapy, Meta-Thought Records, coping cards, relapse prevention planning, and support systems.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Meta-Thought Records (introduced), coping cards (introduced), thought records (ongoing), behavioral experiments (ongoing), Positive Data Log (ongoing), creating a \"toolbox\" of CBT skills (ongoing).
