  "transcript": "Patient: Hi, I'm back for session 19. Here is the summary you provided me at the end of our last session:\n\n- Main topics discussed: Jin-Soo's experience with the cognitive and behavioral experiment related to his job search, managing self-criticism and building more adaptive beliefs, preparing for the end of therapy and maintaining progress.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Cognitive and behavioral experiments (ongoing), thought records (ongoing), Positive Data Log (ongoing), creating a \"toolbox\" of CBT skills (introduced), coping cards (introduced). In future sessions, we will continue building on these techniques and introduce new ones as needed, such as relapse prevention planning and support planning.\n- Homework assigned: Continue practicing thought records, behavioral experiments, and Positive Data Log. Start creating a personal \"toolbox\" of CBT skills and strategies learned in therapy. Reach out for support if needed and prioritize self-care activities.\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms, and important personal details: Jin-Soo is making progress in recognizing and challenging negative thoughts, focusing on the process rather than the outcome, and applying CBT skills in his life. He is feeling more hopeful and confident but acknowledges that there will still be challenges. His depression symptoms appear to be improving, but he still experiences occasional self-doubt and anxiety.\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs: Jin-Soo's negative core belief \"I'm not good enough\" and intermediate belief \"If I'm not perfect, then I'm not valuable or lovable\" continue to be challenged through Positive Data Log, thought records, and behavioral experiments. Reframed core belief \"I am capable and worthy, even when I face challenges or setbacks\" is being reinforced.\n- Important information to carry forward: Jin-Soo's progress with CBT techniques, his willingness to create a toolbox of skills, and the ongoing impact of his negative core beliefs on his self-perception and job search process.\n- Plan for the next session: Review Jin-Soo's experience with the homework, including his progress in creating a toolbox of CBT skills. Explore any challenges or successes he experienced with the thought records, behavioral experiments, and Positive Data Log. Continue discussing strategies for managing self-criticism, building adaptive beliefs, and preparing for the end of therapy.\n\nHere is part 1 of 4 for session 19 of CBT for depression with Dr. Jin-Soo Park:\n\nTherapist: Hello Jin-Soo, it's great to see you today for our 19th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing relatively well. I've continued practicing the thought records, behavioral experiments, and updating my Positive Data Log. I've also started creating my personal \"toolbox\" of CBT skills, which has been helpful in reinforcing what I've learned so far. However, I've noticed that I still struggle with self-doubt and anxiety at times, especially when it comes to my job search.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been consistently practicing the CBT techniques we've discussed and that you've started creating your personal \"toolbox.\" It's also important that you're aware of the ongoing challenges you face with self-doubt and anxiety. Let's make sure to address these concerns during today's session. Before we set our agenda, could you share a bit more about how your mood has been in general since our last session?\n\nPatient: Overall, my mood has been more stable compared to when we first started therapy. I've been feeling more hopeful and confident in my ability to manage my thoughts and emotions. However, there are still moments when I feel overwhelmed by the uncertainty of my future and the pressure I put on myself to succeed. These feelings sometimes trigger my negative core belief that \"I'm not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Jin-Soo. It's common to experience setbacks and challenges even as you make progress in therapy. The fact that you're able to recognize these moments and the thoughts that accompany them is a sign of your growing self-awareness. Today, let's focus on strategies to help you cope with the uncertainty and pressure you're experiencing, as well as continuing to challenge your negative core belief. What else would you like to prioritize in our session today?\n\nPatient: I would like to discuss how I can better manage my anxiety related to my job search and explore ways to maintain my progress after our therapy sessions come to an end. I'm also interested in learning more about relapse prevention planning, as you mentioned in our last session.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. Let's add managing job search anxiety, maintaining progress post-therapy, and relapse prevention planning to our agenda. We'll also continue to work on challenging your negative core belief throughout our discussion. To start, let's explore your experience with job search anxiety. Can you tell me about a recent situation that triggered these feelings?\n\nPatient: Last week, I applied for a job that I was really excited about. I spent a lot of time tailoring my resume and cover letter to fit the position, and I felt like I had a good chance of getting an interview. However, a few days later, I received a generic rejection email from the company. It was disappointing, and I started to feel anxious about my future job prospects.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that experience, Jin-Soo. Receiving a rejection email can be difficult, especially when you've invested time and effort into an application. Let's explore the thoughts and feelings that came up for you in that moment. Can you recall any specific negative thoughts that went through your mind?\n\nPatient: When I read the rejection email, my first thought was, \"I'm not good enough for this job.\" I started to doubt my qualifications and experience, even though I know I'm capable of doing the work. I also worried that I would never find a job that I'm passionate about, and that I would be stuck in this state of uncertainty forever.\n\nTherapist: Those are some challenging thoughts, Jin-Soo. I appreciate your honesty in sharing them with me. Let's take a closer look at the thought \"I'm not good enough for this job.\" Does this thought remind you of the negative core belief we've been working on challenging?\n\nPatient: Yes, it's definitely connected to my core belief that \"I'm not good enough.\" Even though I've been making progress in challenging this belief, it still creeps up on me in moments like these.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jin-Soo. Recognizing the connection between your negative automatic thoughts and your core belief is an important step in the CBT process. Now, let's try to challenge this thought using some of the techniques we've practiced. What evidence do you have that contradicts the thought \"I'm not good enough for this job\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I have a strong educational background and years of experience in my field. I've also received positive feedback from colleagues and supervisors in the past. Additionally, I spent a significant amount of time tailoring my application to fit the job requirements, which shows that I have relevant skills and knowledge.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! You've provided some solid evidence that challenges the negative thought. Now, let's consider some alternative perspectives. Is it possible that factors other than your qualifications influenced the company's decision?\n\nPatient: It's possible that there were a lot of qualified applicants, and they had to make difficult choices. The company's needs might have changed, or they might have found a candidate who was a better fit for their team culture.\n\nTherapist: Those are some great alternative explanations, Jin-Soo. It's important to remember that a rejection doesn't necessarily reflect your worth or abilities. Now, let's try to reframe the negative thought in a more balanced way. What's a more helpful thought you could tell yourself in this situation?\n\nPatient: I could tell myself, \"Even though I didn't get this job, it doesn't mean I'm not good enough. I have valuable skills and experiences, and I will find a job that's the right fit for me.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and adaptive thought, Jin-Soo. How does it feel to tell yourself this instead of the negative thought?\n\nPatient: It feels more empowering and hopeful. It reminds me that one rejection doesn't define me or my future.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the reframed thought feels more helpful for you. As we continue to work on challenging your negative core belief, it's essential to practice generating alternative thoughts in moments of self-doubt or anxiety. This is a skill you can add to your CBT toolbox and use even after our sessions have ended.\n\nTherapist: Jin-Soo, I'd like to introduce a new technique called \"Meta-Thought Records.\" This involves completing thought records about your experience of CBT itself and the progress you've made. It can help address any concerns or anxieties you might have about ending therapy. Would you be open to trying this?\n\nPatient: Yes, I'm willing to give it a try. How does it work?\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by identifying any automatic thoughts you have about your progress in CBT or the idea of therapy coming to an end. For example, you might have thoughts like, \"I'm not sure I can maintain my progress after therapy ends,\" or \"I'm worried I'll relapse without the support of our sessions.\" Once we identify these thoughts, we'll examine the evidence for and against them, consider alternative perspectives, and develop more balanced thoughts. This process is similar to the thought records we've practiced before, but with a focus on your therapy experience itself.\n\nPatient: I see. One thought that comes to mind is, \"I'm afraid I'll lose the progress I've made once I stop attending therapy regularly.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, Jin-Soo. Let's explore this thought further. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been making progress with your guidance and support. I worry that without our regular sessions, I might slip back into old patterns of thinking and behavior.\n\nTherapist: I understand your concern. Now, let's consider the evidence against this thought. What progress have you made that suggests you can maintain your gains even after therapy ends?\n\nPatient: I have been consistently practicing the CBT techniques we've discussed, like thought records and behavioral experiments. I've also started creating my personal \"toolbox\" of skills, which I can refer to when I face challenges.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! Those are strong pieces of evidence that you have the tools and skills to maintain your progress. Let's also consider alternative perspectives. Is it possible that the skills you've developed in therapy will continue to support you even after our sessions end?\n\nPatient: Yes, I suppose it's possible. I've been using these skills outside of our sessions already, so I can continue to apply them in my daily life.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jin-Soo. Now, let's develop a more balanced thought based on the evidence and alternative perspectives we've discussed. What might a more helpful thought be?\n\nPatient: Perhaps a more balanced thought would be, \"Although I'm nervous about ending therapy, I have developed skills and tools that I can use to maintain my progress and cope with challenges on my own.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more empowering and adaptive thought, Jin-Soo. How does it feel to tell yourself this instead of the initial anxious thought?\n\nPatient: It feels more reassuring and reminds me that I have the ability to continue making progress, even without our regular sessions.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. This is a great example of how you can use Meta-Thought Records to address concerns about ending therapy and build confidence in your ability to maintain your progress. Remember, you can always refer back to your personal \"toolbox\" and the skills you've learned whenever you face challenges.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. This technique has been helpful in easing some of my anxieties about the end of therapy. I feel more prepared to handle challenges on my own now.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jin-Soo. I'm glad to see you taking ownership of your progress and feeling more confident in your abilities. As we continue in our session today, let's further explore how you can support yourself after therapy ends and develop a relapse prevention plan to help you maintain your gains.\n\nTherapist: As we wrap up our session today, I'd like to introduce one more technique called \"Coping Cards.\" These are small, portable reminders of the adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs you've developed in therapy. You can create these cards by writing down helpful statements on index cards or in a notes app on your phone. The idea is to have them readily available whenever you need a boost or a reminder of your CBT skills.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a great idea. Could you give me an example of what I might write on a coping card?\n\nTherapist: Certainly! One example could be a card that says, \"I am capable and worthy, even when I face challenges or setbacks.\" This reinforces the new core belief we've been working on. Another card might remind you of a helpful CBT technique, like \"When I'm feeling anxious, I can use a thought record to challenge my negative thoughts.\"\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I can keep these cards with me and refer to them when I need a reminder of what I've learned in therapy.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Coping cards are a great way to support yourself after therapy ends. They can help you stay connected to the skills and insights you've gained, even in challenging moments.\n\nBefore we end today's session, I'd like to check in with you about your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling more hopeful and empowered after our discussion today. I know there will still be challenges ahead, but I feel better equipped to handle them. Thank you for all your support and guidance throughout our sessions.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jin-Soo. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and empowered. Remember, the progress you've made is a testament to your hard work and dedication to your well-being. As we approach the end of our therapy sessions, I want to remind you that you have the skills and tools to continue making progress on your own.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the Meta-Thought Records and create some coping cards for yourself. Also, start thinking about your relapse prevention plan and the support systems you can rely on after therapy ends. We'll discuss this further in our next session.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll work on the homework and start thinking about my relapse prevention plan. Thank you again for everything.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jin-Soo. I look forward to our next session and hearing about your progress. Take care until then.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Managing job search anxiety, preparing for the end of therapy, Meta-Thought Records, coping cards, relapse prevention planning, and support systems.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Meta-Thought Records (introduced), coping cards (introduced), thought records (ongoing), behavioral experiments (ongoing), Positive Data Log (ongoing), creating a \"toolbox\" of CBT skills (ongoing).
