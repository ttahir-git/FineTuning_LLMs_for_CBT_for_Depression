  "transcript": "Patient: One situation where I noticed perfectionism and self-criticism showing up was when I was working on a job application last week. I spent hours trying to make my resume and cover letter perfect, but I kept finding things I wanted to change. I started feeling really frustrated and down on myself, thinking that I wouldn't get the job because my application wasn't good enough.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Jin-Soo. It's a great opportunity for us to explore how perfectionism and self-criticism can impact your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Let's break this down using a thought record.\n\nCan you walk me through the situation in more detail? What thoughts were going through your mind as you were working on the application?\n\nPatient: Well, I kept thinking that if I didn't make everything perfect, I wouldn't have a chance at getting the job. I noticed every tiny mistake or imperfection, and it felt like each one was a reflection of my worth as a candidate and a person.\n\nTherapist: Those are some powerful thoughts. And how did those thoughts make you feel?\n\nPatient: I felt really anxious and stressed out. I also started feeling hopeless, like no matter how much I worked on the application, it would never be good enough.\n\nTherapist: And what about your behaviors? How did those thoughts and feelings influence what you did?\n\nPatient: I ended up spending way more time on the application than I had planned, and I still didn't feel satisfied with it. I also avoided reaching out to a friend who had offered to look over my application because I didn't want them to see all the flaws I perceived in it.\n\nTherapist: This is a great example of how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. The perfectionistic thoughts led to feelings of anxiety and hopelessness, which then influenced your behavior \u2013 spending excessive time on the application and avoiding reaching out for support.\n\nLet's look at those thoughts more closely. Can you identify any cognitive distortions in the thoughts you shared?\n\nPatient: I think I was engaging in all-or-nothing thinking, believing that if my application wasn't perfect, it was worthless. I was also mind-reading, assuming that the potential employer would be judging me harshly for every imperfection.\n\nTherapist: Great insights, Jin-Soo. All-or-nothing thinking and mind-reading are common cognitive distortions, especially when perfectionism is at play.\n\nNow, let's challenge those thoughts using some of the techniques we've been practicing. What evidence do you have that your application needs to be perfect in order to be considered?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess there's no real evidence that it needs to be perfect. I've gotten jobs in the past with applications that probably weren't flawless.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. And what would you tell a friend who was in a similar situation, feeling like their application had to be perfect?\n\nPatient: I would probably remind them that perfection isn't the goal, and that their qualifications and experiences are what really matter.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. So, how can we reframe those original thoughts in a more balanced and helpful way?\n\nPatient: I could tell myself that while I want to put my best foot forward, my application doesn't need to be perfect to be competitive. I can acknowledge my qualifications and experiences, and trust that those will speak for themselves.\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and adaptive way of looking at the situation. How do you think that reframed thought would impact your feelings and behaviors?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel less anxious and more confident. I might be more willing to reach out for support, and I wouldn't spend as much time obsessing over every detail.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By challenging those perfectionistic thoughts, we can start to shift the whole cycle of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\n\nAs we continue to practice these techniques, it's also important to address the underlying beliefs that fuel perfectionism and self-criticism. In our last session, we identified the core belief \"I'm worthless if I'm not successful in my career\" and the intermediate belief \"If I'm not perfect, then I'm not valuable or lovable.\"\n\nI'd like to propose a cognitive experiment to start gathering evidence against those beliefs. What do you think about reaching out to a trusted friend or family member and sharing some of your struggles with perfectionism and self-criticism?",
