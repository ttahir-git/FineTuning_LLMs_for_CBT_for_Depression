  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I have an example from a few days ago. I was working on a project for my community gardening group, and I made a mistake that set us back a bit. My automatic thought was, \"I'm useless, and I'm just holding everyone back.\" I tried to challenge that thought and come up with an alternative, like, \"Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and I'm still a valuable member of the group.\" But even after writing it down, I had a hard time believing the alternative thought.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Jin-Soo. It's a great illustration of how deeply ingrained our negative beliefs can be, and how challenging it can be to shift them. When you're in that moment, and you're struggling to believe the alternative thought, what emotions are you experiencing?\n\nPatient: I feel frustrated with myself, and I feel like I'm not good enough. It's like a heavy weight on my chest, and I just want to withdraw from the situation.\n\nTherapist: That's a very difficult emotional state to be in, and it's understandable why you might want to withdraw. When we're feeling that way, it can be hard to see things from a different perspective. One strategy that can be helpful in those moments is to imagine what you might say to a friend who was in a similar situation. If a friend came to you and said, \"I made a mistake on a project, and now I feel useless and like I'm holding everyone back,\" how would you respond to them?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes, and that one mistake doesn't define their worth or their contributions to the group. I would remind them of all the good work they've done and how much they're valued by the team.\n\nTherapist: That's a very compassionate and supportive response. Now, imagine saying those same words to yourself in that moment when you're struggling. How does that feel?\n\nPatient: It feels a little strange, to be honest. I'm not used to talking to myself that way. But I can see how it could be helpful to try to extend that same compassion to myself.\n\nTherapist: It can definitely feel strange at first, because we're often much harder on ourselves than we are on others. But with practice, it can become more natural to offer yourself that same kindness and understanding. Another strategy that can be helpful is to look for evidence that supports the alternative thought. In this case, you could think about times when you've made valuable contributions to the group or received positive feedback from others. Can you think of any examples like that?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can think of a few times when people have thanked me for my work or told me that they appreciate having me on the team. And there have been projects where I've made significant contributions and felt proud of what we accomplished together.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of evidence that supports the alternative thought. When you're struggling to believe the alternative thought, it can be helpful to remind yourself of those moments and really let yourself feel the pride and sense of accomplishment that comes with them. It's not about ignoring or dismissing the mistake, but rather about seeing it in the context of all your other experiences and contributions.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can see how focusing too much on the mistake and ignoring all the other evidence can lead to those negative beliefs.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And that's something we'll continue to work on together - building up that evidence for the alternative thoughts and practicing self-compassion when those negative beliefs come up. It's a process, and it takes time and practice, but you're already making great progress.",
