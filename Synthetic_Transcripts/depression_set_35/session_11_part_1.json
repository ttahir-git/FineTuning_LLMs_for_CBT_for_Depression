  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jin-Soo, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few limitations as your AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate or not fully applicable to your situation. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, which are important aspects of communication. With that said, I'm committed to working with you to the best of my abilities. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand the limitations and I'm comfortable proceeding with the session.\n\nTherapist: Great, thank you for your understanding. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: I've been feeling a bit more motivated lately. I've been trying to apply the techniques we've discussed, like challenging my negative thoughts and practicing self-compassion. It's not always easy, but I think I'm making some progress. I also reached out to a friend and shared a personal story with them, which was one of the challenges we discussed last time.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more motivated and that you've been actively working on applying the techniques we've covered. Sharing a personal story with a friend is a significant step forward in building social connections and challenging your core beliefs. How did it feel to open up to your friend?\n\nPatient: It was nerve-wracking at first, but afterwards I felt a sense of relief. My friend was supportive and understanding, which made me realize that I don't always have to put up a front.\n\nTherapist: That's a powerful insight, Jin-Soo. Recognizing that you can be vulnerable with others and still receive support is an important step in challenging the belief that you need to be perfect to be valued. Let's keep building on this progress.\n\nFor today's session, I'd like to suggest the following agenda:\n\n1. Review your homework and progress with the positive data log, self-compassion exercises, and challenging cognitive distortions using notecards.\n2. Explore any new cognitive distortions that may have arisen since our last session.\n3. Continue to discuss strategies for managing perfectionism and self-criticism.\n4. Examine your core beliefs in more depth and gather evidence for new, more adaptive beliefs.\n5. Follow up on your progress with building additional sources of social support and designing a hierarchy of challenges related to your core belief.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
