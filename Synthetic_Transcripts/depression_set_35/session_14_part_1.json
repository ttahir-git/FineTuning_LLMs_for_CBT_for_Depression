  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jin-Soo, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI before we begin. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I've been doing alright, I guess. I've been trying to keep up with the homework you assigned, but it's been challenging at times. I did apply to a few jobs, but I haven't heard back from any of them yet. It's hard not to feel discouraged.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it can be difficult to maintain motivation when you don't see immediate results. Let's explore your experience with the job search process a bit more. What thoughts and emotions came up for you while applying for jobs and waiting to hear back?\n\nPatient: Well, I kept thinking that I'm not qualified enough for these positions, even though I know I have the skills and experience. It's like I'm expecting rejection before it even happens. And then when I don't hear back, it just confirms that belief. I feel frustrated and hopeless, like I'll never find a job that's right for me.\n\nTherapist: Those are some really important insights, Jin-Soo. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and negative predictions about the outcome of your job applications. This is something we can definitely work on together. Before we dive deeper into that, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing these negative thoughts and emotions around job searching. It's really taking a toll on my motivation and self-esteem. I also want to discuss how I can be more consistent with the positive data log and self-compassion exercises.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. We can start by exploring the thoughts and beliefs that are contributing to your self-doubt and hopelessness around job searching. Then, we can discuss strategies for building more adaptive beliefs and practicing self-compassion. We'll also review your experience with the positive data log and see how we can help you integrate it more consistently into your routine. How does that sound?",
