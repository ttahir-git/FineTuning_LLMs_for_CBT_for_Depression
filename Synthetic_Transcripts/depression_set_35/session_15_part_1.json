  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jin-Soo, it's great to see you again for session 15. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or significant experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to apply the CBT techniques we discussed to my job search process. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my ability to manage negative thoughts. However, I still find myself getting stuck in self-doubt and hopelessness at times.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been applying the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. Recognizing and managing negative thoughts is an ongoing process, and it's normal to experience setbacks along the way. Can you share a specific example of a situation where you found yourself getting stuck in self-doubt and hopelessness?\n\nPatient: Sure. I recently came across a job posting that seemed like a good fit for my skills and experience. As I started working on my application, I began to doubt whether I was qualified enough for the position. I kept thinking, \"What if I'm not good enough?\" and \"I'll probably just get rejected anyway.\" Those thoughts made me feel really discouraged, and I ended up procrastinating on the application.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Jin-Soo. I can understand how those thoughts of self-doubt and the fear of rejection can be discouraging and lead to procrastination. Let's add this to our agenda for today's session. We can explore these thoughts further and discuss strategies for managing them. What else would you like to prioritize in our session today?\n\nPatient: I'd also like to discuss my experience with reaching out to a job search support group, as you had suggested in our last session. I did some research and found a group that seems promising, but I'm feeling nervous about actually joining and participating.\n\nTherapist: That's a great topic to add to our agenda. It's common to feel nervous about joining a new group, especially when it involves sharing about your job search challenges. We can explore those nerves further and discuss ways to make the experience feel more manageable. \n\nSo, our agenda for today includes:\n1. Exploring the self-doubt and hopelessness thoughts related to the job application\n2. Discussing your experience with reaching out to a job search support group\n3. Reviewing your progress with the positive data log and thought records\n\nDoes this agenda feel complete to you, or is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: That covers the main points I wanted to discuss today. I think this agenda looks good.",
