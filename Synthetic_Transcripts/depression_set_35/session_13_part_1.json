  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jin-Soo, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions. Sometimes I might generate inaccurate information or responses. I'm also not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. And since our interaction is text-based, I can't observe your body language or other non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or significant events in your life recently?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations as an AI, I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the self-compassion exercises and thought records that we discussed. It hasn't been easy, and I still find myself getting caught up in self-critical thoughts, especially when I make mistakes or face setbacks. I had a job interview last week that didn't go as well as I'd hoped, and it triggered a lot of those familiar feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on the exercises we discussed, even though it's been challenging. It's normal to face setbacks and have those self-critical thoughts resurface. The important thing is that you're aware of them and trying to apply the skills you've learned. \n\nI'd like to explore your experience with the job interview and the thoughts and emotions that came up for you. But first, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize? We could discuss the job interview, review your thought records and self-compassion exercises, or explore any other topics that are on your mind.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to start with discussing the job interview and the thoughts and feelings that came up around that. It's still weighing heavily on my mind. We could also review some of the thought records I've been keeping and discuss any patterns or insights that you notice.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan. Let's start with the job interview. Can you tell me more about what happened and what thoughts and emotions you experienced?\n\nPatient: I had high hopes for this interview, as the job seemed like a good fit for my skills and experience. But during the interview, I struggled to articulate my answers clearly, and I could tell that the interviewers weren't impressed. Afterwards, I couldn't stop thinking about all the ways I could have done better, and I felt like a failure. I know we've been working on challenging these kinds of thoughts, but in the moment, it was hard to see things differently.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel disappointed and self-critical after an interview that doesn't go as well as you'd hoped. Let's take a closer look at the thoughts you had after the interview. Can you identify any specific self-critical thoughts that stood out to you?\n\nPatient: One thought that kept running through my mind was \"I'm not good enough for this job, or any job.\" I also thought, \"I'll never be able to succeed in my career again.\" It felt like all the progress I've made in therapy was erased in that moment.\n\nTherapist: Those are powerful thoughts, and I can see how they would feel overwhelming. Let's examine them more closely. When you say \"I'm not good enough for this job, or any job,\" what evidence do you have to support that thought?",
