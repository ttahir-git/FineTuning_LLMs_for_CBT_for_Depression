  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's think about how we can apply some of these strategies to your job search process. One way to start is by setting small, achievable goals for each day or week. This could include tasks like researching potential companies, updating your resume, or reaching out to contacts in your network. By breaking the process down into smaller steps, it can feel less overwhelming and more manageable.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I think I've been putting too much pressure on myself to find the perfect job right away. Setting smaller goals might help me stay motivated and focused.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! And as you work on these goals, try to be mindful of your self-talk. When you notice negative thoughts creeping in, pause and challenge them using the techniques we've practiced, like looking for evidence and generating alternative thoughts.\n\nPatient: I'll try to catch those negative thoughts earlier, before they spiral out of control.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Jin-Soo. Remember, it's a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself as you're learning. Another strategy that can be helpful is to enlist support from others. This could mean reaching out to friends or family members for encouragement, or even joining a job search support group.\n\nPatient: I hadn't thought about joining a support group. That could be helpful to feel less alone in this process.\n\nTherapist: It can be really powerful to connect with others who are going through similar challenges. It normalizes the experience and provides a built-in support system. I can help you look for groups in your area if you're interested.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think I'd like to explore that option more. It's hard for me to ask for help sometimes, but I know I need it.\n\nTherapist: Asking for help takes courage, Jin-Soo. It's a sign of strength, not weakness. I'm glad you're open to trying it. As we wrap up today, I want to check in on how you're feeling. What's standing out to you from our discussion?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a mix of things. It's still hard to shake the negative thoughts and beliefs, but I feel like I have more tools to work with now. I'm hopeful that with practice, I can start to shift my thinking patterns.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Jin-Soo. Remember, change takes time, but every small step counts. You're doing the work, and that's what matters most. For homework this week, I'd like you to continue with your positive data log and thought records, focusing on the job search process. Let's also set a goal for you to research and reach out to one potential support group. We can start there and build on it in future sessions.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds manageable. I'll do my best to stay consistent with the homework and keep challenging those negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I have no doubt you will, Jin-Soo. Remember, progress isn't always linear. There will be ups and downs, but what matters is that you keep moving forward. And I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jin-Soo. I'm really proud of the work you're doing. Let's plan to meet again next week at our usual time. In the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.\n\nPatient: Sounds good. I'll see you next week.\n\nTherapist: I look forward to it.
