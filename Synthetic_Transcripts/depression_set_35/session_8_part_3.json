  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job of identifying and challenging some of the intermediate beliefs that have been contributing to your depression. As we continue this work, we'll also start to explore the deeper core beliefs that underlie these intermediate beliefs. Core beliefs are often formed early in life and can be more generalized statements about ourselves, others, or the world. They can be difficult to change, but by consistently challenging the thoughts and beliefs that stem from them, we can start to shift these core beliefs over time. Does this make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think so. It sounds like core beliefs are kind of like the foundation that all these other thoughts and beliefs are built on. So if we can change the foundation, it can help shift everything else.\n\nTherapist: That's a great way to put it. And we've already started that process by challenging some of those intermediate beliefs. As we continue to do that, it will naturally start to chip away at those core beliefs. Another helpful technique for shifting core beliefs is something called a positive data log. This involves intentionally looking for and recording evidence that supports new, more adaptive core beliefs. For example, if we want to shift the core belief \"I'm not valuable unless I'm perfect\" to something like \"I'm valuable and lovable as I am,\" we would look for evidence that supports that new belief. This could be things like moments of connection with others, times when you felt proud of yourself despite imperfections, or even small acts of self-care that demonstrate your inherent worth. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: I like it. It reminds me of keeping a gratitude journal, but focused specifically on evidence that challenges those old core beliefs. I can see how that could be really powerful over time.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And the great thing is, our brains are naturally wired to start noticing more of whatever we focus on. So the more you actively look for evidence that supports your new core beliefs, the more your brain will start to automatically notice that evidence in your daily life. It's like building a new mental habit. Would you be willing to try keeping a positive data log this week, focused on evidence that you're valuable and lovable as you are, imperfections and all?\n\nPatient: Yes, I'm definitely willing to give it a try. It might be challenging at first, but I can see how it could be really helpful.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're open to trying it. And you're right, it can be challenging at first, especially if those old core beliefs are really entrenched. But even just the act of looking for that evidence can start to shift things, even if you don't always find it. And over time, it will get easier as your brain starts to build those new mental habits. Remember, you don't have to believe the new core belief 100% at first. Even just being open to the possibility that it could be true is a great starting point. And every piece of evidence you record, no matter how small, is a step in the right direction.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I don't have to go from 0 to 100 right away. I can start small and build up over time.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And we'll keep working on challenging those old beliefs and building new ones together in our sessions. Remember, this is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. I'm here to support you every step of the way.",
