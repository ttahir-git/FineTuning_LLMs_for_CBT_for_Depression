  "transcript": "Patient: When you ask for evidence, my mind goes blank. I just feel like I should have done better, and the fact that I didn't get the job is proof that I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: I understand that feeling. Let's break it down together. What specific aspects of the interview do you feel you could have done better on?\n\nPatient: I stumbled over my words a few times, and I didn't have great answers for some of their questions. I also felt like I didn't connect with the interviewers on a personal level.\n\nTherapist: Those are valuable observations. Now, let's consider the evidence against the thought \"I'm not good enough for this job, or any job.\" What are some strengths or accomplishments that suggest you are capable and qualified?\n\nPatient: Well, I do have a strong educational background and years of experience in my field. And I've received positive feedback from colleagues and supervisors in the past.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Those are significant pieces of evidence that contradict the thought \"I'm not good enough.\" It's also important to remember that one interview doesn't define your entire worth or potential. Even the most qualified candidates can have off days or face interviews that don't go as planned.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I guess I have a tendency to overgeneralize and assume that one setback means I'm a failure overall.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Overgeneralizing is a common cognitive distortion that can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and depression. By recognizing that pattern, you can start to challenge those thoughts more effectively.\n\nPatient: It's still hard to shake those feelings, though. Even if I can challenge the thoughts intellectually, the emotions linger.\n\nTherapist: That's a very normal experience. Challenging negative thoughts is an important step, but it's not always enough to shift our emotions right away. That's where self-compassion comes in. How did you find the self-compassion exercises we discussed last session?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to use the self-compassionate mantra we came up with, but it feels a bit forced sometimes. I have a hard time really believing the kind things I'm saying to myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge when starting to practice self-compassion. It can feel unnatural or insincere at first, especially if you're used to a pattern of self-criticism. One strategy that can help is to imagine what you would say to a good friend in a similar situation. How do you think you would respond to a friend who was struggling with self-doubt after a difficult interview?\n\nPatient: I would probably remind them of their strengths and accomplishments, and point out that one interview doesn't define them. I would try to be supportive and encouraging.\n\nTherapist: That's a great instinct. Now, try to apply that same perspective and kindness to yourself. How might you reframe your thoughts about the interview using a more self-compassionate lens?\n\nPatient: I could acknowledge that I was brave for putting myself out there and trying, even though it was scary. And I could remind myself that my worth isn't dependent on any one job or interview.\n\nTherapist: Beautifully said. That's a great example of how self-compassion can help counteract self-criticism. It takes practice, but over time, it can start to feel more natural and authentic.\n\nPatient: I'll keep working on it. I know it's not going to be an overnight change.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it is a process. And you're already making progress by noticing your thought patterns and trying out new strategies. I'm curious, how have you been feeling about the thought records you've been keeping? Have you noticed any patterns or insights there?\n\nPatient: I've definitely noticed that I have a lot of self-critical thoughts throughout the day, not just around big events like the interview. It's been helpful to write them down and try to challenge them, but it's also a bit overwhelming to see how frequent they are.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common experience. Many people find that when they start paying closer attention to their thoughts, they realize just how pervasive certain patterns can be. The good news is that noticing those patterns is the first step in changing them.",
