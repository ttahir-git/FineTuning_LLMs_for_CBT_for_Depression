  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Dr. Park, it's good to see you again for our 10th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health and well-being. \n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. I'm ready to dive into today's session.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to keep up with the positive data log and self-compassion exercises, but it's been challenging at times. I find myself falling back into old patterns of self-criticism and perfectionism, especially when it comes to job applications and social interactions.\n\nTherapist: It's common to face challenges when trying to change long-standing patterns of thinking and behavior. The fact that you're noticing these challenges is a good sign, as it means you're developing more awareness. We can definitely explore these challenges further in today's session. How have the notecards with questions and phrases to challenge cognitive distortions been working for you?\n\nPatient: The notecards have been helpful, but I don't always remember to use them in the moment. When I do use them, I find that they help me gain some perspective and challenge my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Using the notecards consistently can take practice, but it's encouraging that you're finding them helpful when you do use them. Let's set an agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it could be beneficial to:\n\n1. Review your progress with the positive data log and self-compassion exercises\n2. Explore the challenges you've faced with self-criticism and perfectionism\n3. Discuss strategies for managing these challenges, including using the notecards more consistently\n4. Examine any new cognitive distortions that may have arisen\n5. Continue to explore your core beliefs and gather evidence for new, more adaptive beliefs\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I'd also like to discuss how I can start building more social connections outside of the community gardening group. I feel like that's an area where I could use some guidance.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely include that in our agenda. Building social connections is an important part of your recovery and overall well-being. Let's start by reviewing your progress with the positive data log and self-compassion exercises. How have you been finding these practices?",
