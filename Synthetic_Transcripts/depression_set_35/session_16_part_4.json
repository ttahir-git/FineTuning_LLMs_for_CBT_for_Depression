Before we wrap up, let's take a moment to check in on your current mood and any final thoughts you have about our session today.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better than when we started. It's helpful to talk through my thoughts and feelings with you and to have some concrete strategies to work on. I know it's going to take time and practice, but I feel more hopeful than I did before.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Jin-Soo. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. The important thing is that you keep practicing these skills and reaching out for support when you need it.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder. I'll do my best to keep up with the homework and to be patient with myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude to have. For homework this week, I'd like you to continue with the positive data log and thought records, focusing on your job search process. Try to attend another meeting of the job search support group and use the coping statements we discussed to manage any fears of judgment that come up. We'll review your progress and any challenges you encountered at our next session.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. I'll do my best to stay engaged with the group and to keep practicing the skills we've been working on.\n\nTherapist: I have confidence in you, Jin-Soo. Remember, you're not alone in this, and you have the skills and resources to make progress. If you find yourself struggling between sessions, don't hesitate to reach out for support.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I'll see you next week.\n\nTherapist: I look forward to it. Take care, Jin-Soo.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Jin-Soo's experience attending a job search support group, challenging negative thoughts related to job searching, and developing more adaptive beliefs.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Thought records (ongoing), positive data log (ongoing), behavioral experiment (attending support group meeting), coping statements for managing fears of judgment.
