  "transcript": "Here is part 1 of 4 for session 20 of CBT for depression with Dr. Jin-Soo Park:\n\nTherapist: Hello Jin-Soo, it's great to see you for our 20th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations as an AI, Nova. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about that. Since our last session, I've been doing alright. I've been practicing the Meta-Thought Records and using the coping cards we created. It's been helpful in managing my job search anxiety, but I still have moments where I struggle with self-doubt and those negative core beliefs we've been working on.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the Meta-Thought Records and using the coping cards. It's great that you're finding them helpful in managing your job search anxiety. It's also completely normal to still have moments of struggle with self-doubt and negative core beliefs. Overcoming these patterns takes time and consistent effort. Can you tell me more about a specific situation where you found yourself struggling with self-doubt recently?\n\nPatient: Well, I had a job interview last week that I thought went pretty well. But a few days later, I received an email saying they decided to go with another candidate. It was really disappointing, and I started having thoughts like \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'll never find a job that's right for me.\"\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a challenging situation, Jin-Soo. Receiving that kind of news can certainly trigger feelings of disappointment and self-doubt. Let's explore this further. When you had those thoughts of \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'll never find a job that's right for me,\" what emotions did you experience?\n\nPatient: I felt really down and discouraged. It was like all the progress I've made just disappeared, and I was back to square one. I also felt frustrated with myself for not being able to shake off those negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel down, discouraged, and frustrated in that situation. I want to remind you that having those thoughts and feelings doesn't mean you're back to square one. Recovery is not a linear process, and setbacks are a normal part of the journey. What did you do to cope with those emotions after receiving the email?\n\nPatient: I tried to use some of the techniques we've been working on. I took a few deep breaths and tried to reframe the situation. I reminded myself that it's just one job and that it doesn't define my worth or abilities. I also reached out to a friend from my gardening group to talk about how I was feeling.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you were able to use some of the coping strategies we've discussed, like deep breathing and reframing the situation. Reaching out to a friend for support is also a really positive step. How did you feel after taking those actions?\n\nPatient: I felt a bit better after talking to my friend. It helped to get some perspective and remind myself that I'm not alone in this. But I still struggle with those negative thoughts creeping in.\n\nTherapist: It's good to hear that reaching out to your friend provided some relief and perspective. Regarding those negative thoughts, it's important to remember that they are just thoughts, not facts. With continued practice of the Meta-Thought Records and other CBT techniques, you'll get better at recognizing and challenging those thoughts when they arise. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on strategies for managing those negative thoughts and self-doubt, especially in the context of job searching. I also want to discuss how to maintain my progress after our therapy sessions end.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a productive agenda, Jin-Soo. We can definitely focus on strategies for managing negative thoughts and self-doubt related to job searching, as well as discussing relapse prevention and how to maintain your progress after therapy ends. Let's start with the negative thoughts and self-doubt. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts you've been having during the job search process?",
