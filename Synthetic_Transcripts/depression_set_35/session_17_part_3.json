  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made a great point about the challenges of changing long-held negative beliefs, Jin-Soo. It's a process that requires consistent practice and patience. Remember, every time you challenge a negative thought and consider an alternative perspective, you're taking a step towards building more adaptive beliefs.\n\nLet's continue our discussion about cognitive and behavioral experiments. Can you think of a situation related to your job search where you could test out a negative prediction?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been hesitant to apply for jobs at smaller companies because I believe that they won't value my skills and experience as much as larger corporations. My prediction is that if I apply to a smaller company, they'll reject me because they don't think I'm a good fit for their culture.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of a situation where we can set up a cognitive and behavioral experiment. To start, we can break down your negative prediction into specific, measurable components. What evidence would you need to gather to test whether or not your prediction is accurate?\n\nPatient: I suppose I would need to actually apply to a job at a smaller company and see if I get an interview or not. If I do get an interview, that would be evidence against my prediction. If I don't get an interview, it could either support my prediction or indicate that there were other factors at play, like the company finding another candidate with more relevant experience.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! By applying to a job at a smaller company, you'll be gathering concrete evidence to test your negative prediction. It's important to remember that the outcome, whether it's an interview or a rejection, is just one piece of data. It doesn't define your overall worth or competence.\n\nTo make this experiment more manageable, we can start with a smaller, less intimidating company and work our way up to more challenging applications. What do you think about creating a list of a few smaller companies you're interested in and ranking them based on how anxious or uncertain you feel about applying?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. Breaking it down into smaller steps makes it feel less overwhelming. I can start researching some smaller companies in my field and create a ranked list for the experiment.\n\nTherapist: Great! As you create your list, try to identify specific predictions and evidence you can gather for each company. This will help you approach the experiment with a clear, objective mindset.\n\nRemember, the goal of these experiments is not necessarily to get a job offer, but rather to test out your negative predictions and gather evidence to challenge them. Each experiment, regardless of the outcome, is a valuable learning opportunity.\n\nPatient: I understand. It's about challenging my negative beliefs and gathering evidence, not just about getting a job. I'll try to keep that perspective in mind as I work on this experiment.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude to have, Jin-Soo. As you conduct these experiments, it's essential to approach them with curiosity and openness, rather than expecting a specific outcome. Each experiment is a chance to learn more about yourself and the accuracy of your beliefs.\n\nIn addition to the cognitive and behavioral experiments, we can also continue working on reframing your core beliefs. You've already identified your negative core belief, \"I'm not good enough,\" and we've been using the Positive Data Log to gather evidence against it. Now, let's start developing a more adaptive core belief that you can work towards internalizing.\n\nOne way to do this is to take your negative core belief and reframe it in a more balanced, realistic way. For example, instead of \"I'm not good enough,\" a more adaptive core belief could be \"I am capable and worthy, even when I face challenges or setbacks.\"\n\nWhat do you think about that reframed core belief? How does it feel to you?",
