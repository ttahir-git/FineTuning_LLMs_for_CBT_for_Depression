  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I had a situation this week where I felt really down after a job interview didn't go well. I walked away from it feeling like I'd never find a job that suits me.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's use that situation for our thought record. First, can you briefly describe the situation or trigger that led to your negative emotion?\n\nPatient: I had a job interview for a position that I thought aligned well with my skills and values. But during the interview, I felt like I didn't connect with the interviewers, and I struggled to articulate my experience and qualifications effectively.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jin-Soo. Now, let's identify the negative emotion you experienced and rate its intensity on a scale of 0-100.\n\nPatient: I felt really discouraged and hopeless after the interview. I'd say the intensity was around 85 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a very intense emotional response. What was the automatic negative thought that accompanied that emotion?\n\nPatient: My automatic thought was \"I'll never find a job that suits me. I'm just not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a common negative thought pattern, Jin-Soo. Now, let's challenge that thought by examining the evidence for and against it. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you'll never find a suitable job?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been unemployed for six months, and I haven't had much success with my job applications so far. The interview this week felt like another failure.\n\nTherapist: I understand how that experience could contribute to your negative thought. Now, let's look at the evidence against the idea that you'll never find a suitable job. What are some reasons to believe that you will find a job that suits you?\n\nPatient: I have a strong educational background and years of experience in my field. I've also been actively working on my job search and refining my interview skills. And even though the interview this week didn't go well, it doesn't mean that all future interviews will be the same.\n\nTherapist: Those are great points, Jin-Soo. You've identified several reasons to believe that you will find a suitable job, despite the setbacks you've experienced. Now, let's generate a more balanced or realistic thought based on the evidence you've considered.\n\nPatient: A more balanced thought could be \"The job search process is challenging, but I have the skills and experience needed to find a suitable position. One unsuccessful interview doesn't define my entire job search.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent balanced thought, Jin-Soo. Now, let's re-rate the intensity of your negative emotion after considering this new perspective.\n\nPatient: After thinking it through, my discouragement and hopelessness feel less intense. I'd say they're now around 50 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant decrease in intensity, Jin-Soo. This thought record demonstrates how challenging negative thoughts and generating more balanced perspectives can help regulate our emotions. With practice, this process can become more automatic, helping you maintain a more balanced and resilient mindset.\n\nPatient: I can see how this could be a powerful tool. It's helpful to break down my thoughts and emotions in a structured way.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find it helpful, Jin-Soo. Thought records are a core technique in CBT, and we'll continue to practice them in our sessions. As you become more comfortable with the process, you can start using thought records in real-time when you notice negative thoughts arising.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll keep practicing with the thought records and try to use them in the moment when I can.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Jin-Soo. Remember, like any new skill, it takes time and practice to become proficient with thought records. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your encouragement and support.",
