  "transcript": "Patient: Yes, I'd like to practice the deep breathing exercise with you now. I think it could be helpful for me, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's practice deep breathing together. Find a comfortable seated position and place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, counting to four. Focus on filling your belly with air, rather than your chest. Hold the breath for a count of four, then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. As you exhale, feel your belly fall and your body relax. Let's do this together for a few cycles.\n\nPatient: *breathes deeply* I can feel my body starting to relax a little. It's nice to focus on something other than my thoughts for a moment.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Jin-Soo. Deep breathing is a simple but powerful tool for managing stress and overwhelming emotions. With practice, it can become a go-to strategy for grounding yourself when you're feeling anxious or upset. I encourage you to practice deep breathing regularly, even when you're not feeling particularly stressed. The more you practice, the more automatic it will become.\n\nPatient: I will definitely practice deep breathing more often. It's good to have a tool that I can use anytime, anywhere, to help me cope with difficult emotions.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jin-Soo. In addition to deep breathing, there are other distress tolerance skills we can explore in future sessions, such as progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness exercises. These techniques can help you build a toolkit of coping strategies for managing overwhelming emotions.\n\nPatient: I'm looking forward to learning more distress tolerance skills. I think they could be really helpful for me, especially when I'm struggling with negative thoughts and feelings.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Jin-Soo. As we continue to work together, we'll build on the skills you've already learned and introduce new ones to help you manage your depression more effectively. Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks along the way. What matters is that you keep practicing these skills and reaching out for support when you need it.",
