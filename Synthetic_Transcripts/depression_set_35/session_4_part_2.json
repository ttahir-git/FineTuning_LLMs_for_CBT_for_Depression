  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share some of the thought records I completed. One day, I was feeling really down and had the thought, \"I'm never going to get better.\" I rated the emotion as 8/10 for sadness. The evidence I listed for the thought was that I've been struggling for months and haven't seen much improvement. The evidence against the thought was that I've only recently started therapy and that progress takes time. I reframed the thought to, \"I'm taking steps to improve my mental health, and progress may be slow, but it's possible.\" After reframing, I rated my sadness as 6/10.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of using thought records to challenge negative thoughts and reframe them in a more balanced way. I'm glad to see that you were able to recognize the evidence against the initial thought and come up with a more helpful alternative. It's normal for the intensity of the emotion to decrease when we challenge distorted thoughts. Did you find this exercise helpful in managing your emotions in the moment?\n\nPatient: It was helpful to some extent. I felt a little better after reframing the thought, but the sadness didn't go away completely. I guess I'm still struggling with believing the alternative thought. It feels like progress is so slow, and I'm worried that I won't be able to make the changes I need to.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel that way, Jin-Soo. Challenging long-standing negative beliefs takes time and practice. The fact that you're engaging in this process and seeing even small reductions in the intensity of your emotions is a sign of progress. Remember that recovery isn't always a linear process, and setbacks are a normal part of the journey. What matters is that you keep practicing these skills and celebrating the small victories along the way.\n\nPatient: You're right, Nova. I need to be more patient with myself and trust the process. I do want to keep practicing these skills, but sometimes I get overwhelmed and have trouble remembering what to do in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Jin-Soo. One way to make it easier to remember and use these skills is to create a coping card. A coping card is a small, portable reminder of the key skills and strategies you've learned in therapy. You can write down some of the most helpful reframed thoughts, coping statements, or techniques on an index card or in a notes app on your phone. That way, you can easily access them when you need them most. What do you think about creating a coping card for yourself?\n\nPatient: I like that idea, Nova. It would be helpful to have a quick reference when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Can you give me an example of what I might write on a coping card?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jin-Soo. Here's an example of what you could include on your coping card:\n\n1. Thoughts are not facts \u2013 just because I think something doesn't mean it's true.\n2. Progress takes time \u2013 small steps are still steps in the right direction.\n3. I have overcome challenges before, and I can do it again.\n4. Take a deep breath and focus on the present moment.\n5. Engage in a pleasant activity, like gardening or reading.\n\nYou can customize your coping card with the thoughts and strategies that resonate most with you. The goal is to have a portable reminder of the skills you've learned and the progress you've made. Would you like to create a coping card now, or would you prefer to do it as part of your homework for this week?\n\nPatient: I think I'll create a coping card as part of my homework. That way, I can take some time to think about what I want to include and make it really personal to me.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Jin-Soo. Creating a coping card can be a powerful way to reinforce the skills you're learning and make them more accessible in challenging moments. In addition to the coping card, I'd like to introduce another technique that can help with managing overwhelming emotions. It's called \"distress tolerance.\" Distress tolerance skills are strategies that help us cope with difficult emotions and situations without making them worse. One example of a distress tolerance skill is deep breathing. When we focus on taking slow, deep breaths, it can help calm our body's stress response and make it easier to think clearly. Would you like to practice a deep breathing exercise together now?",
