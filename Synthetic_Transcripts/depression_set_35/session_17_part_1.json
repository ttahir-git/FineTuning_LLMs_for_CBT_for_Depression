  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jin-Soo, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and emotions openly through your words. With that said, how have you been since our last session? How did the homework go?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I attended another meeting of the job search support group, and it went better than I expected. I used the coping statements we discussed to manage my fears of judgment, and I found myself feeling more at ease with the group. I also continued with the positive data log and thought records, focusing on my job search process. However, I still find myself struggling with self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy when it comes to applying for jobs.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the support group meeting went well and that you were able to use the coping statements effectively. It's also great that you've been consistent with the positive data log and thought records. Regarding your struggles with self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy, let's explore that further today. How about we add that to our agenda, along with reviewing your homework and discussing strategies for managing self-criticism and building more adaptive beliefs? Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I'd really like to work on overcoming these negative thoughts and beliefs about myself and my job search.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your homework. Can you share some entries from your positive data log and thought records related to your job search?",
