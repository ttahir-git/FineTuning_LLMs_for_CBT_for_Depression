  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for our third session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. I'm feeling a bit low today, to be honest. I've been struggling with my thoughts and feelings lately, and it's been challenging to put the CBT concepts we've discussed into practice.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Alex. It's common to face challenges when trying to apply new skills, and I'm here to support you through this process. Before we discuss your homework, let's set an agenda for today's session. I think it would be helpful to review your homework in detail, finalize our CBT conceptualization of your depression, and begin setting specific, measurable goals for your therapy. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think setting goals will be helpful, as I often feel a bit lost and directionless.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, setting goals can provide a sense of direction and purpose. Let's start by reviewing your homework. Last session, I asked you to continue using thought records to identify cognitive distortions and evidence for and against your negative thoughts. Were you able to do this, and if so, what insights did you gain?\n\nPatient: I did try to use the thought records, but I found it challenging to identify the distortions and evidence when I was feeling really low. I managed to fill out a few records, but I'm not sure if I did them correctly.\n\nTherapist: It's okay if you found it challenging, Alex. This is a skill that takes practice, and it's not always easy to apply when you're feeling overwhelmed by your emotions. Would you feel comfortable sharing one of the thought records you completed? We can go through it together and discuss any challenges you faced.",
