  "transcript": "Patient: It's still challenging to do this in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed, but I can see how it helps when I take the time to go through the process.\n\nTherapist: You're right; it does take practice to apply these skills in the moment. That's why we start by practicing them in less emotionally charged situations, like we're doing now. With time and repetition, it will become easier to catch and reframe negative thoughts as they occur.\n\nPatient: I'm just worried that I won't be able to do this when I'm really struggling. What if I can't remember how to do it, or I'm too overwhelmed to think clearly?\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, Alex. It's common to feel unsure about applying these skills in more challenging situations. One way to build confidence is to practice the techniques in gradually more difficult scenarios. We can also work on developing coping statements or reminders that you can use to ground yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nPatient: What kind of coping statements or reminders could I use?\n\nTherapist: Coping statements are short, positive phrases that you can repeat to yourself when you're feeling distressed. They can help you refocus your thoughts and emotions. Some examples might be \"I can handle this,\" \"This feeling will pass,\" or \"I've gotten through tough times before.\" We can work together to create coping statements that feel authentic and helpful to you.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of having something to remind myself that I can get through tough moments. Maybe I could write them down on notecards and keep them with me.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Alex! Having physical reminders can be very helpful. You could also consider setting reminders on your phone or using an app designed for this purpose. The key is to find a method that works for you and helps you access these coping statements when you need them most.\n\nPatient: I think writing them down would be best for me. I can keep the notecards in my wallet or backpack, so I always have them with me.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a solid plan. Let's take a few minutes now to brainstorm some coping statements that feel meaningful to you. Remember, these should be short, positive, and focused on your ability to cope with difficult situations.\n\nPatient: Okay, let me think. How about \"I am resilient and can handle challenges,\" \"My thoughts do not define me,\" and \"I have overcome hardships before, and I can do it again.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent coping statements, Alex. They acknowledge your strengths and resilience while also recognizing that difficult thoughts and emotions are temporary. I encourage you to write these down on notecards or in a notes app on your phone, so you have them readily available when you need them.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely do that. It feels good to have a plan for managing my thoughts and emotions when things get tough.\n\nTherapist: Having a plan can be very empowering. Remember, it's okay if you don't always remember to use your coping statements right away. With practice, it will become easier to access them when you need them most.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your help in developing this plan. It gives me hope that I can manage my depression and anxiety better over time.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alex. I'm glad we could work together to create a plan that feels manageable and empowering for you. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you continue to practice these skills.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's hard not to get discouraged when I have setbacks, but I know that's part of the process.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Setbacks are a normal part of the journey, and they don't define your overall progress. Each time you practice these skills, you're taking a step towards better managing your mental health. Let's continue to work together to build on your strengths and develop new strategies for coping with challenges as they arise.",
