  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for our 10th session together. Thank you for sharing the summary from our previous session. I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI before we begin. As you know, I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me during our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may be inaccurate. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret any non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'd love to hear how you've been doing since our last session. Can you share with me how your mood has been and if there have been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, my mood has been up and down. I've had some good days where I felt a bit more motivated and was able to get some things done. But there were also days where I struggled to get out of bed and felt really hopeless about the future. I did try to practice the chunking strategy we discussed, and it helped a little bit with breaking down my assignments into smaller tasks.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've had some good days and that the chunking strategy has been somewhat helpful. It's also important to acknowledge the challenging days and the feelings of hopelessness that you've been experiencing. Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind on those difficult days?\n\nPatient: On the bad days, I just feel like I'm never going to get better. I think about how far behind I am in my classes and how I'm not making any progress in my life. I worry that I'll never be able to live authentically as my true self and that I'll always be stuck in this cycle of depression.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound really painful and overwhelming. Let's take a moment to explore them further. When you think about falling behind in your classes, what evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've missed a few deadlines, and I'm struggling to keep up with the readings and assignments. I see my classmates participating in discussions and turning in their work on time, and I feel like I'm not measuring up.\n\nTherapist: I understand how comparing yourself to others can fuel those feelings of inadequacy. Now, let's look at the evidence against this thought. Have there been instances where you've been able to complete assignments or participate in class, even if it's not at the level you'd like?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been times when I've managed to turn in assignments, even if they weren't my best work. And I have participated in discussions occasionally, especially when the topic interests me.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you're able to recognize those moments of success, even if they feel small. It shows that you're not entirely falling behind, and there's evidence that you can engage with your coursework. Now, let's explore an alternative thought. Instead of \"I'm falling behind and not making progress,\" what could be a more balanced way to view your academic situation?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could tell myself that I'm doing the best I can under the circumstances, and even small steps forward are still progress. It's not easy, but I'm not completely failing either.\n\nTherapist: That's a much more compassionate and realistic way to view your situation. Recognizing your efforts and progress, no matter how small, is important. Remember, you're dealing with depression, which makes everything feel harder. Let's continue to work on reframing those negative thoughts and celebrating your successes, no matter the size.\n\nFor today's agenda, I'd like to suggest we focus on a few key areas. First, let's discuss your experience with the homework from our last session, particularly the thought records and distress tolerance techniques. We can explore any challenges or insights you gained from practicing those skills. Second, I'd like to introduce a new technique called the downward arrow, which can help us uncover some of the deeper beliefs that may be fueling your negative thoughts. Finally, we can discuss additional coping mechanisms for managing your depression, stress, and feelings of overwhelm. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm open to trying new techniques, and I definitely want to work on managing my depression and stress better.",
