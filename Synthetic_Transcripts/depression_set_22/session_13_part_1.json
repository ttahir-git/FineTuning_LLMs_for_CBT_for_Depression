  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and sometimes I might generate inaccurate responses. Also, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I can't observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. Despite these limitations, I'm fully committed to supporting you in your journey towards better mental health. \n\nTo start off, I'd like to check in with you. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss today?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and the Positive Data Log. It's been challenging at times, especially when I'm feeling really low. I had a couple of rough days where I struggled to get out of bed and missed some classes. But overall, I think I'm making some progress in recognizing my negative thought patterns.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're noticing some progress, even if it's been challenging at times. It's completely normal to have ups and downs in this process. The fact that you're continuing to engage with the techniques, even when it's difficult, shows a lot of strength and commitment to your well-being.\n\nYou mentioned having a couple of rough days where you struggled to get out of bed and missed classes. Can you tell me more about what was going through your mind during those times?\n\nPatient: Yeah, on those days, I just felt so overwhelmed and exhausted. I kept thinking, \"What's the point of even trying? I'm just going to fail anyway.\" It's like this voice in my head telling me that I'm not good enough and that I'll never be able to live as my authentic self.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alex. Those thoughts sound really painful and discouraging. I want to explore them further with you, as they seem to be connected to some of the core beliefs we've been working on, like \"I'm not worthy of love or happiness.\"\n\nBefore we dive deeper into that, I'd like to set an agenda for today's session. We can definitely prioritize discussing the rough days you experienced and how we can work through those negative thoughts. What else would you like to focus on today?",
