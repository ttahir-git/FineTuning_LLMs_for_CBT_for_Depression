  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great progress today, Alex. We've reviewed your homework, practiced challenging negative thoughts and dismissive thoughts, and discussed your plan for reaching out to a local organization for support related to your gender identity. Before we wrap up, I want to introduce one more technique that can be helpful for managing feelings of overwhelm and anxiety related to your gender identity.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'm open to trying something new.\n\nTherapist: The technique is called \"worry time,\" and it involves setting aside a specific time each day to focus on your worries and concerns. During this designated worry time, you allow yourself to fully explore your worries without judgment. The rest of the day, when worries come up, you gently remind yourself that you'll address them during your worry time.\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. How does that help?\n\nTherapist: By setting aside a specific time for worrying, you're less likely to get caught up in rumination throughout the day. It can also help you feel more in control of your worries, rather than feeling like they're controlling you. During your worry time, you can use the thought record and other techniques we've discussed to challenge and reframe your worries.\n\nPatient: I can see how that might be helpful. I'll give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Great. Remember, it's okay if you don't have all the answers or solutions during your worry time. The goal is simply to contain your worries to a specific time, rather than letting them take over your whole day.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try setting aside some worry time each day and see how it goes.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. Before we end today's session, let's review your homework for the week. You're going to continue practicing thought records and the Positive Data Log, focusing on challenging negative thoughts and dismissive thoughts. You'll also continue with behavioral activation, engaging in activities from your list and breaking them down into smaller steps. Finally, you'll set aside a specific worry time each day to address your worries related to your gender identity. Does that sound manageable?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think so. It's a lot to work on, but I'm starting to see how these techniques can help.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Remember, change takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up today's session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful. I know I still have a lot of work to do, but I feel like I have some tools to help me manage my depression and anxiety better.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Alex. You're making great progress, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns between now and our next session, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed homework from previous session (thought records, Positive Data Log, behavioral activation, reaching out to local organizations)\n  - Practiced challenging negative thoughts and dismissive thoughts using thought records and evidence-gathering\n  - Discussed challenges with staying consistent with coping techniques and strategies for overcoming those challenges\n  - Explored feelings of overwhelm and anxiety related to gender identity and introduced \"worry time\" technique\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Practiced challenging negative thoughts related to upcoming exams and feelings of not being smart enough to be in the program.
