  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I think those are the main areas I need help with right now.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by discussing strategies for remembering and applying the CBT techniques we've covered so far. One helpful way to make these techniques more accessible is to create visual reminders for yourself. For example, you could write down the steps for deep breathing or grounding on a small card and keep it in your wallet or pocket. You could also set reminders on your phone to practice these techniques at specific times during the day. What do you think about trying something like this?\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I like the thought of having a physical reminder with me, like a card in my wallet. I'm not sure if setting reminders on my phone would work because I often ignore notifications when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: Having a physical reminder can be very helpful, and it's great that you're considering what might work best for you. Another strategy is to pair the techniques with activities you already do regularly. For instance, you could practice deep breathing every time you wash your hands or grounding exercises whenever you sit down to eat a meal. By associating the techniques with existing habits, it can become easier to remember and practice them consistently. Does this seem like a strategy you could try?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that could work. I like the idea of using existing habits as reminders. I'll try to think of some activities I do regularly that I could pair with the techniques.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. As you start implementing these strategies, remember that it's normal to face challenges and setbacks. The key is to keep practicing and be patient with yourself. Now, let's move on to reviewing your progress with behavioral activation and breaking down your coursework. How has that been going?\n\nPatient: It's been a bit of a struggle. I've been trying to break down my assignments into smaller tasks, but I still find it hard to get started. Once I do start, I often get overwhelmed and have trouble focusing. I know I need to do the work, but it's like there's this mental block that keeps me from making progress.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience mental blocks and difficulty getting started when you're dealing with depression. This is where the concept of graded task assignments can be helpful. The idea is to break down your tasks into even smaller, more manageable steps and focus on completing one step at a time. For example, if you have a reading assignment, you could set a goal to read for just 5 minutes at first. Once you've accomplished that, you can gradually increase the time or number of pages. The key is to set goals that feel achievable, even if they seem small. This helps build momentum and a sense of accomplishment. What do you think about trying this approach?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of breaking things down into even smaller steps. I think that could help me feel less overwhelmed. It's just hard sometimes because I feel like I should be able to do more, and I get frustrated with myself for not being able to focus for longer periods.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel frustrated and to have expectations for yourself. However, it's essential to recognize that depression can make it more challenging to focus and complete tasks. By setting smaller, achievable goals, you're actually taking important steps towards building your concentration and productivity back up over time. It's a process, and being kind and patient with yourself is crucial. Remember, even small accomplishments are still progress, and they add up over time.",
