  "transcript": "Patient: Some of the negative thoughts I've been having about my upcoming exams are that I'm not smart enough to do well, and that I'm going to fail and disappoint everyone. I keep thinking that if I don't get good grades, it means I'm not cut out for this program and I'll never be successful in my career.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like some really distressing thoughts, Alex. I can understand how they would contribute to feelings of stress and overwhelm. Let's take a closer look at these thoughts using the thought record technique we've practiced before. \n\nCan you think of a specific situation recently where you had these thoughts about not being smart enough and failing your exams?\n\nPatient: Yeah, just the other day I was studying for my data structures exam and I came across a concept that I couldn't quite grasp. I started thinking \"I'm so stupid, I'll never understand this\" and \"I'm going to fail this exam and my whole degree will be a waste.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write that down. The situation was studying for your data structures exam, and the automatic thoughts were \"I'm so stupid, I'll never understand this\" and \"I'm going to fail this exam and my whole degree will be a waste.\"\n\nNow, let's examine the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're stupid and will never understand the concept?\n\nPatient: Well, I was having trouble understanding it in the moment, and I've struggled with some of the course material before. I guess that's evidence that I'm not smart enough.\n\nTherapist: Okay, and what about evidence against these thoughts? Have there been times when you initially struggled with a concept but were able to understand it later?\n\nPatient: Actually, yeah. There have been plenty of times when I didn't get something at first, but after going over it a few more times or asking for help, it clicked. And I have gotten good grades in my courses so far, so that's evidence that I am capable.\n\nTherapist: Great, so there is evidence that you have been able to understand difficult concepts in the past and that you are capable of succeeding in your program. Let's write that down as evidence against the thoughts.\n\nNow, let's look at the thought \"I'm going to fail this exam and my whole degree will be a waste.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess the fact that I'm struggling with some of the material could be evidence. And I do have a fear of failing, even though it hasn't happened yet.\n\nTherapist: And what about evidence against this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've never actually failed an exam before. And even if I did struggle on this one, it wouldn't necessarily mean my whole degree is a waste. One exam doesn't define my entire academic career.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alex. So it seems that while you have some fears and struggles with the material, there is also evidence that you are capable and that one exam does not determine your entire future. Let's write that down as well.\n\nNow, based on this evidence, let's try to come up with some alternative thoughts that are more balanced and realistic. What could be a more helpful way to view this situation?",
