  "transcript": "Patient: I think it was just hard to focus and get started on them. And when I did try to do a thought record, I had trouble identifying my thoughts and challenging them.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed and depressed. Let's see if we can simplify the process a bit. One option is to focus on just one column of the thought record at a time, rather than trying to complete the entire thing in one sitting.\n\nFor example, you could start by simply noticing and writing down your negative thoughts as they occur, without trying to challenge them right away. Once you've practiced that for a while, you could move on to rating the emotions and identifying evidence for and against the thoughts.\n\nWe could also try a more structured approach, like setting aside a specific time each day to work on a thought record, rather than trying to do it in the moment when you're feeling distressed. What do you think of these ideas?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of breaking it down into smaller steps. I think that could make it feel more manageable. And setting aside a specific time could help me be more consistent with it.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's plan to start with just noticing and recording your negative thoughts for the next week. Try to set aside 10-15 minutes each day, at a time when you typically feel a bit more energized, like after a meal or a shower.\n\nYou can use a notebook or the notes app on your phone, whichever is more convenient. Just jot down the thought and the situation that triggered it. We'll review your list together in our next session and start working on the next steps of the thought record.\n\nPatient: Okay, I think I can manage that. I'll try to do it after dinner each day, since that's usually when I have a bit more energy.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. Remember, the goal is not to do it perfectly, but to start building the habit of noticing your thoughts. Even if you only manage to write down one thought a day, that's still progress.\n\nBefore we wrap up, let's do a quick check-in on how you're feeling now. Has anything shifted for you during our conversation today?\n\nPatient: I'm still feeling pretty low, but I do feel a bit more hopeful about being able to manage the negative thoughts. And I think breaking down the homework into smaller steps will help me actually do it.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling a bit more hopeful. Remember, recovery is a process, and every small step counts. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough for now.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to:\n1. Practice the chunking strategy we discussed by breaking down one task or assignment into smaller steps and focusing on completing just one step at a time.\n2. Set aside 10-15 minutes each day, after dinner if possible, to notice and record your negative thoughts. Just write down the thought and the situation that triggered it.\n3. Continue practicing the deep breathing and grounding exercises we've discussed in previous sessions, aiming for at least once a day.\n\nDoes this feel manageable to you? Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?\n\nPatient: It feels more manageable than last week's homework. I think I can do it. No questions for now.\n\nTherapist: Great! I'm confident that you can handle this. Remember, if you have any questions or difficulties during the week, you can always bring them up in our next session. We're in this together, and we'll keep adjusting the plan as needed to make sure it works for you.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Managing feelings of overwhelm by breaking tasks into smaller steps (chunking) and prioritizing based on urgency and importance\n  - Identifying and challenging negative thoughts, particularly those related to self-criticism and hopelessness, using thought records\n  - Adjusting homework to make it more manageable given current emotional state\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Chunking: Breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable steps to reduce feelings of overwhelm. Plan to apply this strategy to a specific task or assignment over the next week.\n  - Thought records: Practiced identifying negative thoughts, rating emotions, examining evidence for and against the thoughts, and generating alternative thoughts. Plan to start with just noticing and recording negative thoughts for the next week, setting aside 10-15 minutes each day.\n  - Prioritizing tasks: Discussed prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance to manage overwhelm. Plan to apply this strategy in combination with chunking.\n  - Distress tolerance techniques: Reviewed deep breathing and grounding exercises from previous sessions. Plan to continue practicing these techniques at least once a day.\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Practice the chunking strategy by breaking down one task or assignment into smaller steps and focusing on completing just one step at a time.\n  - Set aside 10-15 minutes each day, after dinner if possible, to notice and record negative thoughts. Just write down the thought and the situation that triggered it.\n  - Continue practicing deep breathing and grounding exercises, aiming for at least once a day.\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - Alex continues to struggle with depression, feelings of overwhelm, and negative thoughts related to self-criticism and hopelessness. They find it challenging to focus and follow through on therapy homework when feeling overwhelmed. However, they are open to trying new strategies like chunking and breaking down thought records into smaller steps.\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs: Not discussed in this session.\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Alex's experiences with feelings of overwhelm, self-criticism, and hopelessness are crucial areas to continue addressing in therapy. Regularly check in on Alex's emotional state and explore any questions or concerns they may have about the therapy process. Continue to build on cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation strategies, adjusting the pace and complexity as needed based on Alex's current capacity.\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review homework (chunking, noticing and recording negative thoughts, distress tolerance techniques); discuss any challenges or insights gained from practicing these skills; continue building on cognitive restructuring by examining evidence for and against negative thoughts and generating alternative thoughts; explore additional coping mechanisms for managing depression, stress, and feelings of overwhelm; discuss progress on academic goals and provide support as needed.",
