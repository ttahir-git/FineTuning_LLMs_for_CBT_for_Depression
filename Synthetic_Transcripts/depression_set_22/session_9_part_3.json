  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job identifying and challenging the negative thoughts that came up when you tried the chunking strategy. Let's discuss how we can apply this same process to managing the overwhelm you experienced when noticing and recording your negative thoughts. Can you tell me more about what made it feel overwhelming?\n\nPatient: It just felt like there were so many negative thoughts, and they were coming up all the time. I didn't know how to keep track of them all, and it felt like I was just focusing on the negative.\n\nTherapist: That's a common concern when people first start practicing thought records. It can feel like the negative thoughts are constant and overwhelming. One strategy that can help is to set aside a specific time each day to practice noticing and recording your thoughts, rather than trying to do it all the time. This can help make the process feel more manageable. What do you think about trying that approach?\n\nPatient: I think that could be helpful. If I know I have a specific time set aside for it, I might not feel as overwhelmed by trying to do it all the time.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. You can start with just 10-15 minutes a day, at a time when you feel relatively calm and not too distracted. During that time, you can practice noticing any negative thoughts that come up and writing them down. It's okay if you don't catch every single thought - the goal is just to start building awareness of your thought patterns.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can try setting aside some time each evening to do that.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. Another strategy that can help with managing the overwhelm is to focus on just one or two main thoughts each day, rather than trying to capture every single negative thought. You can choose the thoughts that feel most distressing or that you notice coming up most frequently. What do you think about that approach?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It feels more manageable to just focus on a couple of thoughts at a time, instead of trying to tackle everything at once.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that feels more manageable for you. As you practice noticing and recording your thoughts, you'll likely start to notice patterns and common themes. This can help you identify the thoughts that are most important to work on challenging. Remember, the goal isn't to get rid of all negative thoughts - everyone has them sometimes. The goal is to learn how to recognize when our thoughts are distorted or unhelpful, and to practice reframing them in a more balanced way.\n\nPatient: That's a good reminder. I guess I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself to \"fix\" all my negative thoughts, but it's really more about learning to manage them differently.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And that's a skill that takes practice, just like any other skill. You've already made great progress in recognizing and challenging some of your negative thoughts today. As we continue with therapy, we'll keep practicing these skills and building on them. Remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself throughout the process. Learning new ways of thinking takes time and practice.\n\nPatient: Thank you, that's really encouraging to hear. I feel like I have a better understanding of how to approach the thought records now.",
