  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I had a situation last week where I got a lower grade than I expected on a programming assignment. I immediately started thinking that I'm not good enough and that I'll never succeed in my major.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Alex. I can understand how receiving a lower grade than expected can trigger negative thoughts about your abilities and future success. Let's walk through the thought record you completed for this situation. What emotions did you experience, and how intense were they?\n\nPatient: I felt really disappointed and frustrated with myself. I think I rated the intensity of those emotions as 8 out of 10.\n\nTherapist: Disappointment and frustration are valid emotions to experience in that situation. What automatic thoughts did you identify when you explored this further?\n\nPatient: My main automatic thought was, \"I'm not good enough at programming, and I'll never succeed in this major.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a significant thought that can have a strong impact on your emotions and behavior. What evidence did you find that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I didn't do as well as I wanted to on the assignment, and I've been struggling with some of the concepts in class. I see other students seeming to grasp things more easily than I do.\n\nTherapist: It's good that you're able to recognize the evidence that supports the thought. Now, let's explore the evidence against this thought. What have you accomplished in your major so far, and what strengths do you bring to your studies?\n\nPatient: I guess I have been able to complete most of the assignments and projects so far, even if they've been challenging. I've also received positive feedback from my professors on some of my work. And I do have a strong work ethic and a passion for the subject.\n\nTherapist: Those are important pieces of evidence to consider. You've demonstrated the ability to complete assignments, receive positive feedback, and maintain a strong work ethic. How can we reframe your original thought to create an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence for and against it?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I may struggle with some concepts, but I have also shown that I can complete assignments and receive positive feedback. One lower grade doesn't define my overall abilities or potential for success in my major.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Alex. It acknowledges the challenges you face while also recognizing your strengths and accomplishments. How did your emotions change after reframing the thought?\n\nPatient: When I rated my emotions again after coming up with the alternative thought, my disappointment and frustration went down to about a 4 out of 10.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in the intensity of your emotions. This shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing how we feel. By examining the evidence and creating a more balanced thought, you were able to reduce the intensity of your negative emotions.\n\nPatient: It's still challenging to do this in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed, but I can see how it helps when I take the time to go through the process.\n\nTherapist: You're right; it does take practice to apply these skills in the moment. That's why we start by practicing them in less emotionally charged situations, like we're doing now. With time and repetition, it will become easier to catch and reframe negative thoughts as they occur.",
