  "transcript": "Therapist: Hi Alex, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in navigating your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session? I'd love to hear about any changes, challenges, or successes you've experienced.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and behavioral activation. It's been challenging at times, especially with the added stress of upcoming exams. I find myself getting caught up in negative thoughts about my academic performance and my ability to cope with everything.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that the upcoming exams are causing you additional stress, and it's great that you're aware of the negative thoughts that have been coming up. We can definitely explore those further today. I also want to acknowledge the effort you've been putting into practicing the skills we've discussed, even when it's challenging. \n\nBefore we dive in, let's take a moment to set an agenda for our session today. We can review your homework, discuss the negative thoughts related to your exams, and explore additional coping strategies for managing stress. We can also touch on your progress with reaching out to local organizations for gender identity support. Does that sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think it would be helpful to discuss my negative thoughts about exams in more depth, as that's been a big source of stress lately. I'm also curious about exploring more coping strategies for managing stress and overwhelm. I haven't made much progress with reaching out to local organizations yet, but I'm open to discussing that further.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's prioritize discussing your negative thoughts about exams and exploring additional coping strategies for stress and overwhelm. We can touch on reaching out to local organizations if time allows. \n\nTo start, can you share some of the specific negative thoughts you've been having about your upcoming exams?",
