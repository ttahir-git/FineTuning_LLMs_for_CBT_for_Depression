  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share one of the thought records I completed. It was from a few days ago when I was feeling particularly low. I had the thought, \"I'm never going to be able to live as my true self, and I'll always be miserable.\" I identified this as all-or-nothing thinking and fortune-telling, but I struggled to find evidence against the thought.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing this, Alex. Identifying the cognitive distortions is an important first step. All-or-nothing thinking and fortune-telling can make us feel trapped and hopeless. Let's explore this thought further and see if we can find some evidence against it. Have there been any moments, however small, when you felt like you were living as your true self?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been moments when I felt more like myself, especially when I'm engaging with the online community I mentioned before. But those moments feel so fleeting, and I'm not sure if they really count.\n\nTherapist: Those moments absolutely count, Alex. They show that it is possible for you to experience moments of authenticity and connection, even if they're not as frequent or long-lasting as you'd like. This is evidence against the all-or-nothing thinking that you'll \"never\" be able to live as your true self. What about the fortune-telling aspect, the idea that you'll \"always\" be miserable? Have there been any times when you felt less miserable, even if it was just a slight improvement?\n\nPatient: I suppose there have been times when I felt a bit better, like when I'm focused on a board game or when I have a good day at school. But those moments don't last, and the misery always comes back.\n\nTherapist: It's true that the moments of relief may not last as long as we'd like, but the fact that they exist at all is evidence against the idea that you'll \"always\" be miserable. These exceptions, however small, show that your mood is not fixed and that there is potential for change. This is a key principle of CBT - that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected and can influence each other. By identifying and challenging distorted thoughts, we can start to shift our feelings and behaviors in a more positive direction.\n\nPatient: I see what you mean, but it's hard to hold onto those moments of relief when the negative thoughts are so strong.\n\nTherapist: I understand, Alex. Challenging long-standing negative beliefs takes time and practice. That's why we'll be working together to build up your skills in recognizing and reframing distorted thoughts. As we set goals for your therapy, we can keep this in mind and look for ways to increase the frequency and duration of those moments of relief and authenticity.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I think one of my goals could be to find more ways to connect with others who understand what I'm going through, like the online community I mentioned.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Alex. Building a support network of people who understand and accept you can be a powerful antidote to feelings of isolation and hopelessness. We can break that down into smaller, specific steps, like reaching out to one new person in the online community or attending a virtual event related to your interests.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It feels more manageable when it's broken down into smaller steps.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Setting SMART goals - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound - can make them feel more attainable and help us track your progress. Another goal we could consider is related to your thought records. Perhaps we could set a goal of completing a certain number of thought records per week, with a focus on finding evidence against distorted thoughts.\n\nPatient: I think that could be helpful. Maybe I could aim to complete three thought records per week, and try to find at least one piece of evidence against the distorted thoughts in each one.\n\nTherapist: That's a great SMART goal, Alex. It's specific, measurable, achievable, relevant to our work together, and time-bound. As we continue to practice this skill, it will likely become easier to find evidence against distorted thoughts, and you may start to notice a shift in your overall thinking patterns.\n\nPatient: I hope so. It feels like a lot of work, but I'm willing to try.\n\nTherapist: It is work, but it's work that can lead to real changes in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. We'll be working together to build up your skills and find strategies that work for you. How are you feeling about the goals we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful. It's good to have some specific goals to work towards, and I appreciate you breaking things down into smaller steps.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Alex. Setting goals can provide a sense of direction and purpose, and breaking them down into smaller steps can make them feel more manageable. As we continue to work together, we can revisit these goals and adjust them as needed based on your progress and any new insights you gain.",
