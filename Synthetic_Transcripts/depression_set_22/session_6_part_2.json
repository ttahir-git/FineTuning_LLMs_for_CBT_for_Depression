  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I had a situation last week where I was working on a programming assignment, and I just couldn't figure out how to solve this one problem. I started thinking, \"I'm never going to be able to do this. I'm not smart enough to be a computer science major.\"\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a challenging situation, Alex. I appreciate you sharing it with me. Let's walk through the thought record together. So, the situation was working on a difficult programming assignment. The emotions you experienced were perhaps frustration, hopelessness, and self-doubt. How intense would you say those emotions were on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I'd say the frustration was around 80, the hopelessness was 75, and the self-doubt was 90.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have the situation, emotions, and their intensity. Now, let's look at the automatic thought you identified: \"I'm never going to be able to do this. I'm not smart enough to be a computer science major.\" What evidence did you find that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I was having trouble with the assignment, and I've struggled with some concepts in my classes before. I see other students seeming to understand things more easily than I do.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence did you find that goes against this thought?\n\nPatient: I mean, I have gotten good grades in my classes so far. I've been able to complete other assignments, even if they were challenging. And I know that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Alex. It's important to recognize that struggling with one assignment doesn't define your overall abilities or intelligence. Now, based on the evidence for and against the automatic thought, what would be an alternative, more balanced thought?\n\nPatient: I guess an alternative thought could be, \"This assignment is challenging, but I've overcome difficulties before. One tough problem doesn't mean I'm not capable of being a computer science major.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought, Alex! It acknowledges the challenge while also recognizing your past successes and capabilities. Now, if you were to re-rate the intensity of your emotions with this alternative thought in mind, how intense would they be?\n\nPatient: I think the frustration would still be around 60 because the problem is still difficult, but the hopelessness might go down to 40, and the self-doubt to 50.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant decrease in intensity for the hopelessness and self-doubt, which shows how powerful challenging those negative automatic thoughts can be. How did it feel to work through this thought record?\n\nPatient: It felt good to break it down and look at the evidence objectively. It helped me see that my initial thoughts weren't entirely accurate or helpful.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Alex. You did a great job with this thought record. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to catch those negative automatic thoughts and challenge them in the moment. Now, you mentioned earlier that you struggled with the thought records at times. Can you tell me more about those challenges?\n\nPatient: Sometimes, when I'm really overwhelmed, it's hard to think clearly enough to go through the process. And there are times when I feel like the evidence supporting the negative thoughts is stronger than the evidence against them.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid challenges, Alex. When you're feeling overwhelmed, it can be difficult to access the more rational part of your mind. That's where pairing the thought records with distress tolerance techniques can be helpful. If you find yourself too overwhelmed to think clearly, try doing some deep breathing or grounding exercises first, and then come back to the thought record when you're feeling a bit calmer.\n\nAs for feeling like the evidence supporting the negative thoughts is stronger, that's a common experience. Our negative thoughts can be very convincing, especially when we're feeling down. That's why it's important to look at the evidence objectively, almost like a scientist or a detective. Try to consider the situation from an outsider's perspective, or think about what you would say to a friend in a similar situation.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't to dismiss the negative thoughts entirely or to put a positive spin on everything. It's about finding a more balanced, realistic perspective. Does that make sense?",
