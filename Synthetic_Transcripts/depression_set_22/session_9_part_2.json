  "transcript": "Patient: No, I think that covers the main things I wanted to discuss today.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's start by exploring the negative thoughts and anxiety that came up when you tried the chunking strategy. Can you tell me more about the thoughts you noticed?\n\nPatient: Well, like I said before, I kept thinking \"This is too much. I'll never be able to do it all.\" I also had thoughts like \"I'm going to fail this assignment\" and \"I'm not smart enough to handle this.\"\n\nTherapist: Those sound like some really distressing thoughts. Let's look at them more closely. When you had the thought \"This is too much. I'll never be able to do it all,\" what emotions did you feel?\n\nPatient: I felt really overwhelmed and anxious. I also felt hopeless, like there was no point in even trying.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why those thoughts would lead to feelings of overwhelm, anxiety, and hopelessness. Let's examine the evidence for and against the thought \"This is too much. I'll never be able to do it all.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've struggled with big assignments in the past. I've had times where I couldn't finish something or I did poorly because I got too overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you have had some experiences in the past that might make you doubt your ability to handle large tasks. What about evidence against the thought? Have there been times when you were able to break down a large task and make progress on it?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been a few times when I was able to break things down and get them done. Like last semester, I had a big project that I thought was too much at first, but I managed to get it done by focusing on one part at a time.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of evidence against the thought \"This is too much. I'll never be able to do it all.\" It shows that you have been able to handle large tasks in the past by breaking them down. Let's look at an alternative thought that takes into account both the evidence for and against the original thought. What might be a more balanced way of looking at this situation?\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought would be \"Even though this feels overwhelming right now, I have been able to break down large tasks in the past and make progress on them. If I focus on one step at a time, I might be able to handle this assignment.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought! It acknowledges the difficulty of the task and your feelings of overwhelm, but it also recognizes your past successes and the possibility of making progress by focusing on one step at a time. How do you feel when you consider this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit more hopeful. It reminds me that I have been able to handle big tasks before, even if it felt impossible at first.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. This is a great example of how examining the evidence for and against our negative thoughts can help us come up with more balanced and helpful ways of thinking about a situation. As we continue with therapy, we'll keep practicing this skill of cognitive restructuring to help manage the negative thoughts that contribute to feelings of overwhelm and hopelessness.",
