  "transcript": "Patient: That does make sense. It's just hard to be objective when I'm in the middle of those negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Alex. It takes practice to be able to step back and look at your thoughts objectively, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. That's why we start by practicing the thought records when you're feeling a bit calmer, like we did just now with the example from your homework. As you continue to practice, it will become easier to apply the skill in the moment when those negative thoughts arise.\n\nAnother helpful technique is to imagine what you would say to a friend who was in a similar situation and having those same negative thoughts. Often, we're much kinder and more objective with others than we are with ourselves. By taking that perspective, it can help you challenge your own negative thoughts more effectively.\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be helpful. I'm definitely harder on myself than I am on my friends.\n\nTherapist: Many people find that to be true, Alex. It's a common experience. As you continue to practice these skills, you'll likely find it easier to extend that same compassion and objectivity to yourself.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and talk about building in-person connections, which you mentioned was a priority for you. What are some of the barriers you've experienced in making those connections?\n\nPatient: I think a big part of it is my anxiety around people knowing that I'm transgender. I'm worried about how they'll react, so I tend to keep people at a distance.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, Alex. It takes a lot of trust to share something so personal, and it's understandable that you'd want to protect yourself. At the same time, it sounds like keeping people at a distance is also contributing to feelings of loneliness and disconnection. What do you think might be a small step you could take towards building more in-person connections, while still honoring your need for safety and privacy?\n\nPatient: I'm not sure. I guess maybe I could try to find some clubs or groups on campus that align with my interests, like computer science or board games. That way, I could connect with people over shared interests without necessarily having to disclose anything too personal right away.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Alex! Joining clubs or groups related to your interests is a fantastic way to meet people and build connections gradually. It allows you to focus on the shared activity and get to know people in a more low-pressure setting. You can take your time and disclose personal information at your own pace, as you feel more comfortable.\n\nAnother option might be to look for LGBTQ+ groups or resources on campus. That could provide an opportunity to connect with others who may have similar experiences and understand some of the unique challenges you face.\n\nPatient: That's true. I have been hesitant to get involved with LGBTQ+ groups because I didn't want to out myself, but it might be worth looking into.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to have hesitations about getting involved with LGBTQ+ groups, given your concerns about privacy and safety. If you do decide to explore that option, remember that you can take things at your own pace and share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. The important thing is that you're taking steps towards building connections and finding support, in whatever way feels right for you.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I'll think about it some more. I know I need to do something to feel less alone, but it's just hard to put myself out there.\n\nTherapist: It is hard, Alex. It takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there and try to make new connections, especially when you've had experiences of feeling judged or misunderstood in the past. Remember that it's okay to take small steps and go at your own pace. Even something as simple as attending a club meeting or event and just observing, without necessarily talking to anyone, can be a good starting point.\n\nAs you continue to work on challenging your negative thoughts and building your self-confidence, it may become easier to take those steps towards connecting with others. And remember, you don't have to do this alone. I'm here to support you every step of the way, and we can continue to brainstorm strategies and work through any challenges that come up.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your support. It helps to know that I don't have to figure this all out on my own.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alex. I'm glad I can be here to support you. Remember, building connections and overcoming social anxiety is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Let's continue to explore this topic and brainstorm strategies together.\n\nNow, I'd like to spend some time reviewing the other homework assignments from last session, specifically the distress tolerance techniques and the graded task assignments related to your coursework. How did those go for you?\n\nPatient: The distress tolerance techniques were helpful. I tried doing the deep breathing and grounding exercises when I was feeling overwhelmed, and it did help me feel a bit calmer in the moment. I'm still working on remembering to do them consistently, but I think it's getting easier with practice.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Alex! It's wonderful that you're finding the distress tolerance techniques helpful in managing overwhelming emotions. Remembering to use them consistently can be a challenge, especially when you're feeling distressed. That's why pairing them with existing habits can be so helpful.\n\nFor example, you could try doing a quick grounding exercise every time you sit down to work on your coursework, or practice deep breathing whenever you're waiting for a class to start. By linking the techniques to things you already do regularly, it can help them become more automatic and easier to remember.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I'll try to find some ways to pair them with my existing routines.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful! Let's talk a bit more about your graded task assignments related to your coursework. How did that go?",
