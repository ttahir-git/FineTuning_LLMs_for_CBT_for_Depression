  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great insights today, Alex. Before we wrap up, I want to check in on how you're feeling now. How would you describe your current mood?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better than when we started. I still feel overwhelmed, but I think I have a clearer idea of how to manage it now.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling a bit better and have some new tools to work with. Remember that progress isn't always linear - there will be ups and downs, but the important thing is that you keep practicing these skills and reaching out for support when you need it.\n\nPatient: Thanks, I'll try to keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: Let's discuss some homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing the chunking strategy we discussed earlier, breaking down one task or assignment into smaller steps and focusing on completing just one step at a time. You can also try applying the cognitive restructuring skills we practiced today to any negative thoughts that come up as you work on the task.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can try that.\n\nTherapist: Great. I'd also like you to set aside 10-15 minutes each day, at a time that works for you, to practice noticing and recording your negative thoughts. Remember to focus on just one or two main thoughts each day, rather than trying to capture every single one. And don't forget to practice the deep breathing and grounding exercises we've discussed in previous sessions, aiming for at least once a day.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best to practice those things.\n\nTherapist: I'm confident that with continued practice, these skills will start to feel more natural and helpful. Remember that you can always reach out if you have any questions or concerns between sessions.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alex. I'm here to support you. Let's plan to meet again next week at the same time. In the meantime, take care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.\n\nPatient: Sounds good, I'll see you next week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Managing feelings of overwhelm when trying new coping strategies like chunking\n  - Strategies for making thought records feel more manageable, such as setting aside a specific time each day and focusing on one or two main thoughts\n  - Practicing cognitive restructuring to challenge negative thoughts related to self-doubt and hopelessness\n  - Checking in on overall mood and any other challenges or successes since the last session\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Chunking: Breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable steps to reduce feelings of overwhelm.
