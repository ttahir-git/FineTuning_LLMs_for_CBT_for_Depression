  "transcript": "Therapist: It's great that you're recognizing the importance of questioning those negative thoughts and looking for evidence against them. That's a key skill in cognitive restructuring.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, I'd like to explore some strategies for managing the stress you're feeling about your upcoming exams. One technique that can be helpful is called \"worry time.\"\n\nWith worry time, you set aside a specific, limited period each day to focus on your worries. During that time, you allow yourself to worry freely, without judgment. But outside of that designated time, you practice letting go of those worries and focusing on the present moment.\n\nWhat do you think about trying something like that?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of having a specific time to worry, instead of letting it take over my whole day. I'm not sure how easy it will be to let go of the worries outside of that time, but I'm willing to try.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Alex. Like any new skill, it might take some practice to get the hang of it. But setting that boundary around your worry time can help you feel more in control of your thoughts and less overwhelmed by them.\n\nAnother strategy that can be helpful during times of stress is mindfulness. Mindfulness is simply the practice of focusing your attention on the present moment, without judgment.\n\nThere are many ways to practice mindfulness, but one simple technique is called \"five senses.\" You take a moment to notice one thing you can see, one thing you can hear, one thing you can touch, one thing you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This helps ground you in the present moment and can be a calming way to take a break from stressful thoughts.\n\nWhat do you think about incorporating some mindfulness practice into your daily routine, especially during times of high stress?\n\nPatient: I've heard of mindfulness before, but I've never really tried it. The five senses technique seems pretty straightforward, so I'm definitely willing to give it a shot.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Alex. Even just a few minutes of mindfulness practice each day can make a difference in how you feel.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, I'd like to assign some homework for the coming week. First, I'd like you to continue practicing the thought records and Positive Data Log we've been working on. Try pairing the thought records with a daily activity, like doing them after dinner each night.\n\nSecond, I'd like you to try setting aside some worry time each day, maybe 15-20 minutes. During that time, let yourself worry freely, but try to let go of those worries outside of that designated time.\n\nFinally, try incorporating some mindfulness practice into your daily routine, using the five senses technique we discussed. Even just a few minutes each day can be helpful.\n\nHow does that sound?\n\nPatient: That all sounds good. I'll definitely try the worry time and mindfulness, and keep working on the thought records and Positive Data Log.\n\nTherapist: Great, Alex. I'm really proud of the progress you've made and the effort you're putting into this work. Remember, it's okay if it feels challenging at times. The important thing is that you keep showing up and trying.\n\nBefore we end today's session, I'd like to check in with you one last time. How are you feeling now, and do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better than when we started. It's helpful to have some new strategies to try, and I feel a bit more hopeful about managing my stress and depression. I know it's not going to be easy, but I'm committed to keeping at it.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Alex. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nThank you for your hard work today. I look forward to hearing about your experiences with the homework next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed and practiced cognitive restructuring skills, including thought records and evidence-gathering\n  - Discussed the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors using the CBT triangle\n  - Introduced the Positive Data Log technique for reframing negative core beliefs\n  - Checked in on the patient's emotional state and explored any final thoughts\n  - Explored strategies for managing stress, including worry time and mindfulness\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Continued practicing identifying negative thoughts, examining evidence for and against the thoughts, and generating alternative thoughts. Plan to continue setting aside time each day to notice and record negative thoughts, focusing on one or two main thoughts each day.\n  - CBT triangle: Discussed the connection between situations, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Practiced identifying these elements in a recent experience and explored how challenging negative thoughts could lead to more positive feelings and actions.\n  - Positive Data Log: Introduced the technique of collecting evidence that supports new, more adaptive beliefs. Encouraged the patient to start a log, focusing on evidence that contradicts the belief \"I'm not worthy of love or happiness.\"\n  - Worry time: Introduced the concept of setting aside a specific, limited period each day to focus on worries, while practicing letting go of worries outside of that designated time.\n  - Mindfulness: Introduced the \"five senses\" technique for grounding in the present moment and taking a break from stressful thoughts.\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue practicing thought records, setting aside time each day to notice and record negative thoughts, focusing on one or two main thoughts each day. Examine evidence for and against the thoughts and generate alternative thoughts.\n  - Practice the Positive Data Log technique, recording experiences or observations that support the new belief \"I am worthy of love and happiness, even when I'm not perfect or when I'm going through a hard time.\"\n  - Set aside 15-20 minutes of worry time each day, allowing worries to flow freely during that time but practicing letting go of worries outside of that designated time.\n  - Incorporate mindfulness practice into daily routine, using the \"five senses\" technique to ground in the present moment and take a break from stressful thoughts.\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - The patient is making progress in recognizing the impact of negative thoughts on mood and behavior. They are open to trying new techniques and willing to put in the effort to change unhelpful thinking patterns. The patient struggles with feelings of worthlessness and finds it challenging to motivate themselves to engage in activities when feeling depressed.\n  - The patient had a couple of rough days where they struggled to get out of bed and missed classes, but overall is making progress in managing depressive symptoms.\n  - The patient is feeling stressed about upcoming exams and financial concerns related to student loans, but is willing to try new stress management techniques like worry time and mindfulness.\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Core belief: \"I'm not worthy of love or happiness\"\n  - Intermediate belief: \"If I can never live as my authentic self, it means that I'll always be trapped in this body that doesn't feel like mine, and I'll never truly be happy or at peace with myself.\"\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - The patient's core belief \"I'm not worthy of love or happiness\" and the intermediate beliefs related to living authentically are crucial areas to continue addressing in therapy. Regularly check in on the patient's emotional state and explore any questions or concerns they may have about the therapy process. Continue to build on cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, self-compassion, and Positive Data Log techniques, adjusting the pace and complexity as needed based on the patient's current capacity.\n  - The patient's upcoming exams and financial concerns are potential stressors that may impact their mood and should be monitored in future sessions.\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review homework (thought records, Positive Data Log, worry time, mindfulness); discuss any challenges or insights gained from practicing these skills; continue challenging the core belief \"I'm not worthy of love or happiness\" and build on cognitive restructuring skills; explore additional coping mechanisms for managing depression, stress, and feelings of overwhelm; discuss progress on academic goals and provide support as needed.",
