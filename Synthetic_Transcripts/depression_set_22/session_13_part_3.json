  "transcript": "Here is Part 3 of 4 of the CBT session transcript:\n\nPatient: When I was lying in bed, feeling overwhelmed, I kept thinking about how behind I am in my classes and how I'll never be able to catch up. I also started worrying about my student loans and how I'm going to pay them back. It just felt like everything was piling up on me.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like really heavy thoughts, Alex. I can understand how they would make it difficult to get out of bed and face the day. Let's explore these thoughts further and see if we can identify any cognitive distortions or underlying beliefs that might be contributing to them.\n\nWhen you think about being behind in your classes, what evidence do you have that supports the idea that you'll never be able to catch up?\n\nPatient: Well, I've missed a few assignments, and I'm struggling to understand some of the material. I just feel like I'm so far behind that it's impossible to get back on track.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, and it's valid to feel concerned about missed assignments and difficult material. However, I wonder if there might be some cognitive distortions at play here, such as all-or-nothing thinking or catastrophizing.\n\nAll-or-nothing thinking is when we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms, without acknowledging the shades of gray in between. In this case, it might sound like, \"If I'm not completely caught up, I'm a total failure.\"\n\nCatastrophizing is when we assume the worst possible outcome, even if it's not the most likely. It might sound like, \"If I don't understand this material right away, I'll never be able to learn it, and I'll fail the class.\"\n\nDo either of these distortions resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think I do fall into those patterns sometimes. It's hard to see the gray areas when I'm feeling so overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Alex. Recognizing these distortions is an important step in challenging them. Let's try to find some evidence against the thought that you'll never be able to catch up.\n\nHave there been times in the past when you've fallen behind but managed to get back on track? Or times when you've struggled with material but eventually understood it?\n\nPatient: Actually, yeah. Last semester, I got really behind in one of my classes, but I was able to work with the professor to make up the work and ended up doing well. And there have been plenty of times when I didn't understand something at first, but I kept working at it and eventually figured it out.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples, Alex! They show that even when you're facing challenges, you have the ability to overcome them. It might take some extra effort and support, but it's not impossible.\n\nNow, let's look at the thoughts about your student loans. What makes you feel like you won't be able to pay them back?\n\nPatient: I just feel like I'm never going to make enough money to cover my expenses and my loans. I'm already struggling financially, and it just seems like an impossible situation.\n\nTherapist: I can hear the worry in your words, Alex. This is another situation where it might be helpful to challenge some of those cognitive distortions, like catastrophizing or fortune-telling.\n\nFortune-telling is when we predict a negative outcome without enough evidence to support it. In this case, it might sound like, \"I'll never be able to pay back my loans, so I'm doomed to be in debt forever.\"\n\nWhile it's true that student loans can be a significant financial burden, there are often options for managing them, such as income-driven repayment plans or loan forgiveness programs. Have you had a chance to explore any of these options?\n\nPatient: Not really. I guess I've been so caught up in worrying about it that I haven't really looked into what my options are.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, Alex. Worry can be overwhelming and make it difficult to take action. However, seeking out accurate information about your options can be a powerful way to challenge those worries and feel more in control of your situation.\n\nAs we've been discussing these thoughts, I've noticed that they seem to be connected to some of the intermediate and core beliefs we've identified, such as \"I'm not worthy of love or happiness\" and \"If I can never live as my authentic self, I'll never truly be happy or at peace with myself.\"\n\nDo you see any connections between these thoughts and those beliefs?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think there is a connection. When I'm worrying about school or money, it feels like confirmation that I'm not capable or worthy. And the thought of being trapped in debt feels like being trapped in a life that doesn't feel true to who I am.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important insights, Alex. Recognizing these connections can help us understand why certain thoughts or situations feel so triggering and overwhelming.\n\nAs we continue to work on reframing those core beliefs, it can also help to challenge the thoughts and assumptions that stem from them. For example, the thought \"I'll never be able to pay back my loans\" might be connected to the belief \"I'm not capable or worthy.\"\n\nBy challenging that thought and seeking out accurate information about your options, you can start to build evidence against that core belief and develop a more balanced, compassionate view of yourself.\n\nWhat do you think about that?\n\nPatient: It makes sense. I guess I've been so focused on the negative thoughts that I haven't really stopped to question them or look for evidence against them.",
