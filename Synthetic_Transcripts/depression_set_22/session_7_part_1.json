  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for our seventh session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to acknowledge that I am an AI, and my capabilities are limited. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide me during our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I lack the ability to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like deep breathing and grounding when I feel overwhelmed. It's been challenging, but I think it's helping a bit. I completed a few thought records, but I'm still struggling with negative thoughts about my coursework and productivity.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the distress tolerance techniques and working on thought records. It's okay if it feels challenging; that's a normal part of the process. I'm here to support you as we continue to work on these skills. Before we dive in, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing my negative thoughts about coursework and productivity. It's been really affecting my mood and motivation. I'm also feeling isolated and lonely, so maybe we could discuss strategies for building connections with others.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. Let's start with addressing the negative thoughts related to your coursework and productivity. We can review the thought records you completed and explore any challenges or insights you gained from the process. Then, we can discuss strategies for building connections with others and expanding your support network. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm hoping to find ways to manage my thoughts and feelings better, so I can focus on my work and feel more connected to others.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging it can be to manage negative thoughts and feelings of isolation. Let's start by reviewing one of the thought records you completed since our last session. Can you share an example of a situation that triggered negative thoughts about your coursework or productivity?",
