  "transcript": "Patient: I could try thinking something like \"I may be struggling with this concept right now, but that doesn't mean I'm stupid or incapable. I've been able to understand difficult material before, and I can do it again.\" And for the thought about failing, maybe something like \"One exam doesn't define my entire academic career. Even if I don't do as well as I'd like, it's not the end of the world and I can still be successful.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are great alternative thoughts, Alex! They acknowledge the current challenges you're facing, but also recognize your past successes and the bigger picture. Let's write those down.\n\nNow that we have these alternative thoughts, let's consider how believing them might impact your feelings and behaviors. How do you think you would feel if you truly believed these alternative thoughts?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel less anxious and stressed about the exam. I might feel more motivated to keep trying, even if I'm struggling, because I believe that I can understand the material eventually.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. And how might your behavior change if you believed these alternative thoughts?\n\nPatient: I think I would be more likely to reach out for help when I need it, instead of just giving up. And I might be more willing to take breaks and practice self-care, instead of just studying non-stop out of fear of failing.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like really positive changes in your behavior that could help reduce your stress and improve your overall well-being. Let's write those down as well.\n\nYou've done a great job using the thought record to challenge your negative thoughts about the upcoming exams. I know it's not always easy to remember to do this in the moment, but the more you practice, the more automatic it will become. \n\nAnother technique that can be helpful for managing stress and overwhelm is called \"worry time.\" This involves setting aside a specific time each day to focus on your worries and write them down, instead of letting them consume your thoughts all day long. During this designated worry time, you can use thought records or other techniques to challenge and reframe your worries. What do you think about trying this technique?\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. I like the idea of having a specific time to focus on my worries, instead of letting them take over all the time. How long do you think I should set aside for worry time each day?\n\nTherapist: It's really up to you and what feels manageable. I would suggest starting with about 15-20 minutes per day, at a time when you can be alone and focus without distractions. It's important to be consistent and try to do it at the same time each day, so it becomes a habit. \n\nDuring your worry time, you can write down all the worries that are on your mind, and then go through them one by one using thought records or other techniques we've practiced. The goal is not to eliminate your worries completely, but to contain them to a specific time and place, so they don't interfere with the rest of your day.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can try setting aside 20 minutes each evening for worry time. I'll write down my worries and then challenge them using thought records. I'll let you know how it goes at our next session.\n\nTherapist: That sounds great, Alex. I'm really proud of you for being willing to try new techniques and put in the effort to manage your stress and negative thoughts. Remember, it's a process and it takes practice, so be patient with yourself.\n\nWe have a few minutes left in our session today. I wanted to check in on how you've been feeling about reaching out to local organizations for gender identity support. I know that's something we've talked about before, but I understand it can be a big and scary step. How has that been going for you?",
