  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive into today's agenda, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm committed to working with you to the best of my abilities. How are you feeling today, and what's been on your mind since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. I've had some good days where I felt motivated and productive, but I've also had days where I struggled with low mood and anxiety, especially with my upcoming exams. I've been trying to use the worry time technique we discussed, but it's been challenging to stick to it consistently.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience a range of emotions, and I'm glad you've had some good days mixed in with the more challenging ones. Consistency can be difficult when implementing new coping strategies. Let's explore what specific challenges you've faced with the worry time technique, and perhaps we can brainstorm some solutions. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing my stress and anxiety related to my upcoming exams, as well as discussing my progress with reaching out to local organizations for gender identity support. I'm also interested in reviewing the CBT techniques we've covered so far and discussing how I can continue using them after our sessions end.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Alex. Let's start by discussing your upcoming exams and the stress and anxiety you've been experiencing. Can you tell me more about your thoughts and feelings surrounding the exams?\n\nPatient: I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself to perform well, and I'm worried that if I don't do well, it will somehow confirm that I'm not worthy of love or happiness. I know it's irrational, but I can't seem to shake the thought.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel pressure to perform well, but it's important to recognize that your self-worth is not determined by your exam results. This thought seems to be connected to your core belief, \"I'm not worthy of love or happiness.\" Let's explore this further using a thought record. Can you identify any evidence that supports or refutes this thought?",
