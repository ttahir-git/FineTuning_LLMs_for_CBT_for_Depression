  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by discussing some strategies to manage the overwhelming feelings you've been experiencing. One effective technique is called \"chunking,\" which involves breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This can help prevent the feeling of being overwhelmed by the entirety of a task.\n\nFor example, if you have a big assignment due, instead of focusing on the entire project, you could break it down into smaller chunks like researching, outlining, drafting, and editing. Then, focus on completing just one chunk at a time, taking breaks in between as needed. How do you think this strategy could be applied to your current situation?\n\nPatient: I can see how that might help. I often get stuck thinking about everything I need to do, and it feels impossible to even start. Breaking things down into smaller steps could make it less daunting.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Chunking can be a powerful tool in managing overwhelm. Another strategy is to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance. This can help you focus on what truly needs to be done first and let go of less critical tasks, at least temporarily.\n\nLet's practice applying these strategies to a specific task or situation you're currently facing. Can you think of something that's been causing you to feel overwhelmed?\n\nPatient: Well, I have a programming project due next week, and I haven't even started it yet. Every time I think about it, I just feel paralyzed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's break down the project into smaller chunks. What are some of the steps involved in completing this project?\n\nPatient: I guess the first step would be to read through the project requirements and make sure I understand what I need to do. Then, I'd need to plan out the structure of the program and start writing the code. After that, I'd need to test and debug the program, and finally, submit it.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! You've already identified several clear steps. Now, let's prioritize these steps. It seems like reading through the project requirements is the most urgent and important first step, as it will guide the rest of your work. Does that feel manageable to start with?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think I could handle reading through the requirements. It's a smaller task, and it would help me feel like I'm making some progress.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Starting with a smaller, manageable task can help build momentum and reduce the feeling of overwhelm. Remember to take breaks as needed and celebrate each small accomplishment along the way.\n\nNow, let's discuss how to handle the negative thoughts that have been creeping in, particularly those related to self-criticism and hopelessness. Can you give me an example of a negative thought you've been having recently?\n\nPatient: I keep thinking that I'm not doing enough, that I'm falling behind in my classes and in life in general. And sometimes, I feel like I'll never get better, like I'm just stuck in this cycle of depression.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts can be incredibly painful and discouraging. Let's examine them more closely using a thought record. First, can you identify the situation or trigger that tends to precede these thoughts?\n\nPatient: It usually happens when I'm trying to work on an assignment or when I see my classmates seeming to do well and enjoy their lives.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so in those situations, the thoughts \"I'm not doing enough\" and \"I'll never get better\" arise. What emotions do you feel when you have these thoughts?\n\nPatient: I feel really sad, hopeless, and ashamed.\n\nTherapist: Those are heavy emotions to carry. Let's rate the intensity of each emotion on a scale of 0-100. How intense would you say the sadness is? The hopelessness? The shame?\n\nPatient: The sadness is probably around 80, the hopelessness is 90, and the shame is about 85.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the thought \"I'm not doing enough\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm behind on a lot of my assignments, and I haven't been participating much in class. I also haven't been taking care of myself like I should, and I'm not really connecting with people.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against this thought? In what ways might you be doing enough, or at least doing the best you can given your current circumstances?",
