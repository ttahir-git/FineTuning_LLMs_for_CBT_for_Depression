  "transcript": "Patient: I guess I'm doing the best I can given how depressed I've been feeling. It's hard to focus and motivate myself when I'm feeling so low. And I did manage to go to most of my classes this week, even if I didn't participate much.\n\nTherapist: That's an important piece of evidence against the thought \"I'm not doing enough.\" Despite the depression, you're still showing up to classes, which is a significant accomplishment. What about the thought \"I'll never get better\"? What evidence do you have for and against this thought?\n\nPatient: The evidence for it is that I've been feeling depressed for a long time, and it seems like nothing I do makes a difference. But against it, I guess I have made some progress in therapy, and there have been times when I've felt a bit better, even if it didn't last.\n\nTherapist: It's true that progress in therapy isn't always linear, and setbacks can happen. However, the fact that you've made some progress and had moments of feeling better suggests that recovery is possible, even if it's gradual. Let's look at some alternative thoughts that might be more balanced and helpful.\n\nFor \"I'm not doing enough,\" an alternative thought could be \"I'm doing the best I can given my current circumstances, and showing up to classes is a significant accomplishment.\" How does that feel to you?\n\nPatient: It feels a bit more compassionate and realistic. I guess I am doing the best I can, even if it doesn't always feel like enough.\n\nTherapist: And for \"I'll never get better,\" an alternative thought might be \"Recovery is a gradual process with ups and downs, but the progress I've made in therapy so far shows that change is possible.\" What do you think of that?\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's hard to remember the progress when I'm feeling really low, but I know there have been some improvements.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Now, let's re-rate the intensity of the emotions you were feeling. How intense is the sadness now? The hopelessness? The shame?\n\nPatient: The sadness is still pretty high, maybe around 70. But the hopelessness has gone down to about 60, and the shame is around 65.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in the intensity of those emotions, especially the hopelessness and shame. This shows how challenging negative thoughts can have a powerful impact on how we feel.\n\nAs we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to catch and reframe negative thoughts in the moment. Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate negative thoughts entirely, but to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective.\n\nNow, let's revisit the homework from last session and see how we can adjust it to make it more manageable given your current emotional state. You mentioned having difficulty completing the thought records. What specifically made it challenging?",
