  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, let me pull up my Positive Data Log. I've been trying to notice times when I prioritize my own needs, like the example I shared earlier about playing my flute in the park. But even in that moment, I felt guilty afterwards. It's like I can't fully enjoy it because I'm always thinking about what I \"should\" be doing instead.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, and it highlights how deeply ingrained that belief is. Let's look at that example through the lens of a thought record. What was the situation? What emotions did you feel, and how intense were they? What thoughts were going through your mind?\n\nPatient: The situation was me playing my flute in the park. In the moment, I felt content and peaceful, maybe at a 3 out of 10 intensity. But afterwards, the guilt set in, and that was more like a 7 out of 10. The thoughts were things like, \"I should have been helping my child with college applications\" or \"I'm being selfish by taking this time for myself.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have the situation, emotions, and thoughts. Now let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you were being selfish by taking that time for yourself?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the evidence would be that I wasn't doing something productive, like helping my child or cleaning the house. My family always put a high value on productivity and self-sacrifice.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against the thought that you were being selfish?\n\nPatient: Hmm, well, I know that taking breaks and doing things I enjoy can actually make me more productive in the long run. And like we talked about earlier, it can help me be more present and supportive in my relationships. So in that sense, it's not really selfish.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. You're starting to challenge that belief by looking at the evidence objectively. Let's keep going with this thought record. What's an alternative, more balanced thought you could have about taking time for yourself?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"It's okay to take breaks and do things I enjoy. It doesn't mean I'm selfish or neglecting my responsibilities. In fact, it can actually help me be a better parent and partner.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. How does that feel compared to the original thought?\n\nPatient: It feels more compassionate and less judgmental. Like I'm giving myself permission to have my own needs and desires.\n\nTherapist: That's a big shift, and it takes practice to internalize those new thoughts. This is where your coping card can come in handy. Did you find yourself using it this week?\n\nPatient: I did, actually. There was one day where I was feeling particularly overwhelmed and guilty for not being more available to my child. I pulled out the coping card and read through the affirmations we had written down, like \"I am worthy of love and acceptance, even when I prioritize my own needs.\" It helped a bit in the moment, but the guilt still crept back in later.\n\nTherapist: That's okay. The fact that you used the coping card and found some relief in the moment is a success. And the guilt creeping back in is just a sign that this belief is deeply ingrained and will take time and practice to change. You're doing the work, and that's what matters.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I guess I just get frustrated with myself sometimes for not being able to \"fix\" this belief more quickly.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel frustrated, but I want to remind you that changing long-held beliefs is a process, not a one-time event. You're making progress, even if it doesn't always feel that way. And speaking of progress, I'd like to spend some time reviewing the techniques we've covered so far and how you've been applying them. This will help reinforce your learning and give us a chance to troubleshoot any challenges. Is that okay with you?",
