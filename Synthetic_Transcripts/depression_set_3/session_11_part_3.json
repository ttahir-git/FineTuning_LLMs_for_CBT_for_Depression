  "transcript": "Patient: Yes, that summary captures the main points well. I feel like I have a better understanding of why I might be struggling with the thought records and some specific strategies to try.\n\nTherapist: Great! Before we move on to discussing your anxiety about your child's college decision, I want to check in on how you're feeling about what we've discussed so far. Do you have any questions or concerns, or is there anything you'd like to explore further?\n\nPatient: I think I'm feeling clearer about the thought records and how to approach them. I appreciate you breaking down the steps and helping me identify the cognitive distortions that might be getting in my way. I'm sure I'll still have challenges with it, but I feel more equipped to handle them now.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more equipped to handle the challenges with thought records. Remember, it's okay if it's still difficult at times \u2013 that's part of the process of learning and growing. I'm here to support you as you continue to practice and refine these skills.\n\nPatient: Thank you, that means a lot. I do want to talk more about my anxiety around my child's college decision. It's been weighing on me heavily lately.\n\nTherapist: Of course, let's explore that further. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been causing you anxiety around this decision?\n\nPatient: I think a big part of it is the uncertainty. I don't know where they'll end up or how it will change our relationship. I'm worried about them being far away and whether they'll be able to handle the challenges of college life. I also feel a sense of responsibility, like I should be doing more to help them make the right decision.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel anxious about the uncertainty and changes that come with your child leaving for college. It's a big transition for both of you. Let's break down some of the specific concerns you mentioned and see if we can find ways to manage the anxiety around them.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I think the uncertainty is the biggest thing for me. I like to feel in control and prepared, and this feels like a big unknown.\n\nTherapist: Uncertainty can be really challenging, especially if you tend to feel more comfortable when things are predictable and within your control. One strategy that can be helpful is to focus on what you can control in the situation, rather than what you can't. For example, you can control the support and guidance you offer your child as they make this decision, but you can't control the outcome or what happens once they're at college. Shifting your focus to your own actions and responses can help reduce the anxiety around the uncertainty.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I have been focusing a lot on the things I can't control, like where they'll end up or how they'll adjust.\n\nTherapist: It's a natural tendency to focus on the unknowns, but it can also fuel anxiety. Another strategy is to practice tolerating uncertainty, which means accepting that some things are inherently unknowable and learning to sit with the discomfort of that. This might involve acknowledging your anxious thoughts about the future, but not getting too caught up in them or trying to solve for every possible scenario.\n\nPatient: Tolerating uncertainty is definitely something I need to work on. I tend to get stuck in worst-case scenario thinking and trying to plan for every eventuality.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. We can practice some exercises to help build your tolerance for uncertainty, like visualizing yourself coping with an uncertain situation or intentionally leaving some aspects of a plan open-ended. The goal is not to eliminate the anxiety completely, but to learn to manage it and not let it dictate your actions or decisions.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of visualizing myself coping with uncertainty. It's empowering to think of myself as capable of handling whatever comes my way, even if I don't know exactly what that will be.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Visualizing yourself coping effectively can help build confidence and resilience in the face of uncertainty. Another aspect to consider is the worry about your changing relationship with your child. It's normal to feel some anxiety about this transition, but it can also be an opportunity to redefine your relationship in a positive way.\n\nPatient: I hadn't thought about it that way, but you're right. It is an opportunity to relate to each other in a new way, as adults. I guess I've been focusing more on the loss and the change than on the potential for growth.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel a sense of loss or grief around this transition \u2013 it's a significant change in your role and relationship. But you're right, there is also potential for growth and a new kind of connection with your child. It might help to reframe the change as an evolution of your relationship rather than a loss of what you had before.\n\nPatient: That reframing is helpful. I can see how holding onto the past too tightly could actually make the transition harder for both of us.\n\nTherapist: It's a delicate balance \u2013 honoring the past while also being open to the future. Another strategy is to focus on the present moment and the opportunities you have now to connect with your child, rather than getting too caught up in worries about the future. This might mean being intentional about spending quality time together or having open conversations about your hopes and fears around this transition.\n\nPatient: Focusing on the present moment is something I've been working on in general, but I can see how it applies here too. I want to make the most of the time we have left before they leave for college, rather than letting my anxiety about the future overshadow that.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal. Being present and engaged in the moment can help ease anxiety about the future and also strengthen your connection with your child. It's okay if it's not perfect or if you still feel anxious at times \u2013 the important thing is that you're making an effort to show up and be present with them.\n\nPatient: Thank you for this perspective. I feel like I have some concrete strategies to try now when I start to feel anxious about the college decision and the transition.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. Remember, it's a process and it's okay if it takes time and practice. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you navigate this transition. It's also okay to lean on your support system, whether that's friends, family, or a therapist, when you need some extra help or guidance.",
