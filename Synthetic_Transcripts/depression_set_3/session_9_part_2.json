  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me, Nova. I think focusing on those areas will be really helpful. I don't have anything specific to add, but I'm open to discussing whatever comes up during our conversation.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Jamie. We can always adjust the agenda if needed as we go along. Let's start by reviewing your experiences with boundary-setting and self-compassion practices since our last session. Can you share some examples of when you were able to set boundaries or practice self-compassion, and how it felt for you?\n\nPatient: One example that comes to mind is when my sibling asked me to help them with a project last week. In the past, I would have dropped everything to assist them, even if it meant sacrificing my own needs. This time, I politely told them that I had other commitments and could only help them at a later time. It was difficult, but I reminded myself that my needs matter too.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example of setting a healthy boundary, Jamie. It takes courage to prioritize your own needs, especially when it involves saying no to someone you care about. How did you feel after setting that boundary?\n\nPatient: I felt a mix of emotions. On one hand, I was proud of myself for asserting my needs. On the other hand, I felt guilty for not being able to help my sibling right away. I had to keep reminding myself that it's okay to prioritize myself sometimes.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel that mix of emotions, Jamie. Change is often accompanied by discomfort, and it takes practice to navigate those feelings. The fact that you were able to set the boundary despite the guilt is a significant step forward. Did you use any self-compassion techniques to help you cope with the guilt?\n\nPatient: I tried to practice some of the self-compassionate statements we discussed, like reminding myself that it's okay to have limits and that I'm doing the best I can. It helped a little, but I think I need to keep practicing.\n\nTherapist: You're right, Jamie. Self-compassion is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. The more you use those self-compassionate statements, the more natural they will feel. It's great that you were able to use them in that moment, even if the relief was temporary. Let's explore another example of when you practiced self-compassion. Can you think of a time when you were able to treat yourself with kindness, even in the face of a challenge or setback?",
