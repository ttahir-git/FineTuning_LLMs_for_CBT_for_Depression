  "transcript": "Patient: As my child prepares to leave for college, I'm finding it harder to set boundaries with my family. They expect me to be available all the time, and I feel guilty when I'm not. It's like I'm being pulled in different directions, and I don't know how to balance it all.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and guilty, especially during this time of transition. Setting boundaries with family can be particularly challenging because of the deep emotional connections and long-standing patterns of interaction. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a recent situation where you struggled to set a boundary with your family?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, my sister called me and asked if I could help her with a project she's working on. I had already planned to spend that day preparing for my child's graduation party, but I felt obligated to say yes. I ended up feeling resentful and exhausted afterwards.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. It highlights how saying yes when you really want or need to say no can lead to feelings of resentment and exhaustion. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle. What thoughts were going through your mind when your sister asked for your help?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"If I don't help her, she'll think I'm selfish,\" and \"I should always be there for my family, no matter what.\"\n\nTherapist: And what emotions did those thoughts trigger?\n\nPatient: I felt guilty, anxious, and trapped.\n\nTherapist: And what was the behavior that resulted from those thoughts and emotions?\n\nPatient: I said yes to helping her, even though I didn't want to.\n\nTherapist: This is a clear example of how our thoughts can influence our emotions and behaviors. The thought that you should always be there for your family, regardless of your own needs, led to feelings of guilt and anxiety, which then led to the behavior of saying yes when you wanted to say no. Does this make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes, it does. I can see how my thoughts are driving my actions, even when it's not what I really want.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. So, let's practice generating an alternative thought that might lead to a different emotional response and behavior. What could you have told yourself in that moment that would have allowed you to set a boundary with your sister?\n\nPatient: I could have told myself, \"It's okay to prioritize my own needs sometimes,\" or \"Helping my sister this time doesn't mean I'm selfish.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are great alternative thoughts! Let's practice using them in a role-play scenario. I'll play the role of your sister, and you can practice responding assertively, using the boundary-setting statements we discussed earlier. Are you ready to give it a try?\n\nPatient: Yes, I'm ready.",
