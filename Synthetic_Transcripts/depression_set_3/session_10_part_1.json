  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for our 10th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Finally, I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me so far. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the boundary-setting and self-compassion techniques we discussed. It's been challenging, but I've had some small successes. I've also been working on the thought records, but I'm still struggling with consistency and motivation.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you've had some successes with the boundary-setting and self-compassion techniques. It's normal to face challenges when implementing new skills, and the fact that you're persisting despite these difficulties is a testament to your resilience. Regarding the thought records, let's explore what specific obstacles you're encountering and see if we can find ways to make the process more manageable for you. Before we do that, could you share a bit more about how your mood has been since our last session?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. I've had moments of feeling more hopeful, especially when I successfully set a boundary or practice self-compassion. But there are also times when I feel overwhelmed and question whether I'm making any real progress. I know change takes time, but it's hard to be patient with myself.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to experience a range of emotions during this process. Recognizing and celebrating small victories, like setting boundaries and practicing self-compassion, is crucial. At the same time, it's okay to acknowledge the challenges and doubts that arise. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are a normal part of the journey. Today, let's focus on strategies to help you maintain consistency with the thought records and explore any underlying beliefs that might be contributing to your doubts about progress. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I think I could benefit from some strategies to make the thought records more manageable. And I'm curious about what underlying beliefs might be holding me back.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by setting an agenda for today's session. We can begin by discussing your experiences with the thought records and identifying any specific challenges you've faced. Then, we can explore strategies to make the process more manageable and consistent. After that, we can delve into any underlying beliefs that might be contributing to your doubts about progress and work on reframing those beliefs. Finally, we can review your Positive Data Log and discuss any additional experiences you've had with acting \"as if\" to build evidence for your new core belief. How does that agenda sound to you?",
