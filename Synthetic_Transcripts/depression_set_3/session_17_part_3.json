  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made an important connection here, Jamie. This thought record really illustrates how your intermediate belief about always putting others' needs first can lead to feelings of guilt and anxiety when you try to set boundaries. Let's explore this further. Can you think of a recent situation where this belief influenced your behavior?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. Just last week, my neighbor asked me to help them move some heavy furniture. I had plans to spend that day working on a personal project I'm passionate about, but I immediately said yes to my neighbor without even thinking about it. I ended up feeling resentful and frustrated with myself afterwards.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle. What thoughts were going through your mind when your neighbor made the request?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I can't say no, they really need my help,\" and \"If I don't help, they'll think I'm selfish and unneighborly.\"\n\nTherapist: And what emotions did those thoughts trigger?\n\nPatient: I felt guilty at the thought of saying no, and anxious about my neighbor's potential judgment.\n\nTherapist: And then, what behavior did you engage in based on those thoughts and feelings?\n\nPatient: I said yes to helping, even though I had other plans, and I ended up feeling frustrated and resentful afterwards.\n\nTherapist: This is a clear example of how our thoughts can influence our feelings and behaviors. In this case, your intermediate belief about always putting others' needs first led to thoughts of guilt and anxiety, which in turn influenced your behavior of saying yes when you really wanted to say no. Does this make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes, I can see that pattern playing out. It's almost like I'm on autopilot, always defaulting to putting others first, even at the expense of my own needs and wants.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Recognizing this pattern is the first step in changing it. Now, let's practice challenging this intermediate belief using the evidence you've gathered in your thought records and Positive Data Log. Can you think of a time when you prioritized your own needs and it turned out okay?",
