  "transcript": "Patient: The self-critical thoughts I notice are usually related to feeling like I'm not doing enough or that I'm not good enough. For example, I might think \"I should be doing more to help my child prepare for college\" or \"I'm not being a good enough parent because I'm struggling with my own emotions.\" These thoughts make me feel guilty and like I'm failing in some way.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. Those self-critical thoughts can be really painful and can contribute to feelings of guilt and inadequacy. It's important to remember that these thoughts are not facts, and they often stem from underlying beliefs that may not be entirely accurate.\n\nOne strategy for addressing self-critical thoughts is to practice self-compassion. This involves treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a good friend who was struggling. For example, if a friend came to you and said \"I feel like I'm not doing enough to help my child prepare for college,\" what might you say to them?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that they're doing the best they can and that it's okay to struggle sometimes. I might remind them of all the ways they have supported their child and that it's not solely their responsibility to ensure their child's success.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how you might respond to a friend with compassion and understanding. The challenge is to offer that same compassion to yourself when you notice self-critical thoughts arising. One way to do this is to practice speaking to yourself as if you were your own good friend.\n\nAnother strategy is to examine the evidence for and against the self-critical thoughts. For example, when you think \"I'm not being a good enough parent because I'm struggling with my own emotions,\" you could ask yourself: \"What evidence do I have that supports this thought? What evidence do I have that contradicts it?\"\n\nPatient: When I think about it that way, I can see that there is evidence that I am a good parent, even if I'm struggling with my own emotions. For example, I know that I love my child deeply and that I'm doing my best to support them. I also know that struggling with emotions doesn't mean I'm a bad parent \u2013 it just means I'm human.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! By examining the evidence for and against the self-critical thoughts, you can start to see that they may not be entirely accurate. This can help you develop a more balanced and compassionate perspective.\n\nAnother important aspect of addressing self-criticism is to identify the underlying beliefs that may be fueling these thoughts. For example, you mentioned earlier that you have a core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" This belief may be contributing to your self-critical thoughts and making it harder to practice self-compassion.\n\nOne way to start shifting this core belief is to look for evidence that contradicts it. For example, you could keep a \"Positive Data Log\" where you write down instances that demonstrate your worth and capabilities, no matter how small they may seem.\n\nWhat do you think about trying out some of these strategies for addressing self-criticism? We could practice speaking to yourself with compassion, examining the evidence for and against self-critical thoughts, and keeping a Positive Data Log to challenge the core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\"\n\nPatient: I like the idea of practicing self-compassion and examining the evidence for and against my self-critical thoughts. The Positive Data Log also seems like a good way to start challenging my core belief. I'm willing to give these strategies a try and see how they work for me.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Jamie. I'm really encouraged by your willingness to try out these strategies. Remember, it's okay if it feels challenging at first, and we can always adjust the plan as needed. The most important thing is that you're making an effort to relate to yourself with more compassion and to challenge the thoughts and beliefs that are contributing to your distress.\n\nBefore we move on, I want to check in on how you're feeling about these strategies for addressing self-criticism. Do you feel a bit more hopeful about being able to challenge these thoughts and beliefs?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I do feel more hopeful. I can see how practicing self-compassion and examining the evidence could help me challenge the self-critical thoughts. And I like the idea of keeping a Positive Data Log to start shifting my core belief. It feels like a more concrete way to work on changing my thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful, Jamie. That's a really positive sign that you're open to trying new strategies and making progress. Remember, changing long-standing thoughts and beliefs takes time and practice, so be patient with yourself as you work on these skills.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and check in on your mood and overall progress. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have you noticed any changes in your mood or thought patterns?\n\nPatient: Since our last session, I've been feeling a bit more hopeful overall. I've had some good days where I feel more motivated and able to engage in activities that I enjoy. But I've also had some harder days where I feel more down and struggle to get out of my own head.\n\nTherapist: It's really common to have ups and downs in your mood, especially when you're working on making changes to long-standing thought patterns. The fact that you've had some good days where you feel more motivated and engaged is a really positive sign that the work you're doing in therapy is starting to have an impact.\n\nOn the harder days, what do you notice happening with your thoughts and behaviors? Do you find yourself getting stuck in self-critical thoughts or engaging in behaviors that might not be helpful?",
