You've been actively engaging in the techniques we've discussed, and I can see the effort you're putting into challenging your negative thoughts and beliefs. Remember that change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks along the way. What are your thoughts and feelings as we come to the end of today's session?\n\nPatient: I feel encouraged by the progress I've made, even if it's not always easy. I appreciate the tools you've given me, like the Positive Data Log, to help me continue working on my beliefs and thoughts between sessions. I'm looking forward to practicing these techniques and seeing how they impact my daily life.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you find the tools helpful, Jamie. Remember, consistency is key, and even small steps can lead to significant changes over time. Before we end, let's discuss your homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing the boundary-setting and self-compassion techniques we've discussed, and to start using the Positive Data Log to collect evidence for your new core belief. Additionally, try to complete at least one thought record per day, breaking it down into smaller steps if needed.
