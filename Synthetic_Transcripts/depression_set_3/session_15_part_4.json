  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made, Jamie. You've been working hard to notice and challenge cognitive distortions, practice self-compassion, and set healthy boundaries. These skills take time to develop, and it's normal to have ups and downs along the way. What are your thoughts and feelings as we close out today's session?\n\nPatient: I feel encouraged by the progress I've made, even though I know I still have work to do. It's helpful to have these tools and strategies to manage my negative thoughts and practice self-compassion. I'm looking forward to continuing our work together.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Jamie. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have challenging moments. The key is to keep practicing these skills and being kind to yourself along the way.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the loving-kindness meditation, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. You can also extend the phrases of kindness and well-wishes to others, such as loved ones or friends. Additionally, keep working on the thought records, focusing on one thought at a time and examining the evidence for and against it. Finally, see if you can set another small boundary with someone in your life, and notice how it feels to assert your needs.\n\nWe'll continue to build on these skills in our next session. If any challenges or insights come up between now and then, feel free to jot them down so we can discuss them.\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll do my best to practice these skills between now and our next session.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at our next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Reviewed patient's experience with setting boundaries and explored how it relates to their intermediate belief about always putting others' needs first\n- Discussed strategies for managing overwhelming negative thoughts and making the thought record process more manageable, including focusing on the most distressing thought first and examining the evidence for and against it\n- Practiced self-compassion through loving-kindness meditation and explored ways to make it feel more accessible, even when the critical voice is loud\n- Checked in on patient's progress with noticing cognitive distortions and discussed new examples of \"all-or-nothing thinking\"\n\nTechniques or exercises used:\n- Thought records: Discussed strategies to make the process more manageable, including focusing on the most distressing thought first and examining the evidence for and against it\n- Self-compassion: Practiced loving-kindness meditation and explored ways to make it feel more accessible, even when the critical voice is loud\n- Cognitive distortions: Reviewed patient's progress with noticing cognitive distortions and discussed new examples of \"all-or-nothing thinking\"\n- Behavioral experiments: Reviewed patient's experience with setting boundaries and explored how it relates to their intermediate belief about always putting others' needs first\n\nHomework assigned:\n1.
