  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. With all that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today? How have things been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. I've had some good days where I felt more hopeful and motivated, but also some tough days where I struggled with low mood and self-doubt. I tried to work on the homework you assigned, but I found it challenging at times.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to have ups and downs, and I'm glad you're sharing your experiences openly with me. Can you tell me more about the challenges you faced with the homework?\n\nPatient: Well, I started the Positive Data Log, but I found it hard to come up with evidence for the new belief. I kept getting stuck in the old pattern of thinking that my worth is tied to sacrificing for others. And when I tried to set a boundary with a friend, I felt guilty afterwards, like I was being selfish.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging it can be to shift long-held beliefs and patterns of thinking. The fact that you're noticing these thoughts and feelings is an important first step. Perhaps today we can explore these experiences further and work on strengthening your new, more balanced belief. What do you think about including that in our agenda for today's session, along with reviewing your thought records and discussing any other topics that feel important to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'd also like to talk more about how my cultural background and family experiences influence my beliefs about setting boundaries and prioritizing my own needs. I think that's a big part of why I struggle with this so much.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's a crucial area for us to explore further. So, our agenda for today includes:\n\n1. Reviewing your thought records and discussing any challenges or successes you had with them.\n2. Exploring the challenges you faced with the Positive Data Log and setting boundaries, and working on strengthening your new core belief.\n3. Discussing how your cultural background and family experiences influence your beliefs and behaviors around setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs.\n4. Checking in on your overall progress and any other topics that feel important to you.\n\nDoes this agenda feel comprehensive and prioritized according to your needs?\n\nPatient: Yes, that covers everything I wanted to discuss today. I feel good about this plan.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your thought records. Can you share an example of a thought record you completed since our last session?",
