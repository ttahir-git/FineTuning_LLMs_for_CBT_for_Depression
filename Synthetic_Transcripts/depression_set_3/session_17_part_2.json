  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I had a situation come up with my sister again. She asked me to watch her kids for the weekend, and my initial thought was \"I have to say yes, because if I don't, she'll think I'm selfish and uncaring.\" I felt guilty and anxious, rating those emotions as 8 out of 10. \n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's walk through the thought record together. What evidence did you find that supported the thought \"I have to say yes, because if I don't, she'll think I'm selfish and uncaring\"?\n\nPatient: Well, in the past, when I've tried to set boundaries with my family, they've often reacted negatively. My sister has made comments before about how I'm not as family-oriented as she is because I don't always drop everything to help out.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so that past experience is influencing your current thought. What evidence did you find that didn't support the thought?\n\nPatient: When I really thought about it, I realized that I've set boundaries with my sister before and she didn't completely cut me off or stop speaking to me. And there have been times when she's respected my needs, even if it took some discussion. Also, I know that I do care about my family and I show that in many ways, not just by always saying yes to requests.\n\nTherapist: That's an important realization. Based on that evidence, what was the alternative thought you came up with?\n\nPatient: I reframed it as \"I can set boundaries and still be a caring person. My sister may not always like it, but that doesn't mean she'll think I'm completely selfish and uncaring. I need to prioritize my own needs sometimes, and that's okay.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent work! How did your emotions change after coming up with that alternative thought?\n\nPatient: My guilt and anxiety went down to about a 4 out of 10. I still felt a bit uncomfortable, but it was more manageable.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift. This thought record really shows how examining the evidence and coming up with a more balanced perspective can help reduce intense negative emotions. Let's discuss how this relates to the intermediate belief we identified last session, about needing to always put others' needs first.",
