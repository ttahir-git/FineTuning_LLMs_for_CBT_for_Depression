  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 9. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I appreciate you sharing those limitations, Nova. It's good to be aware of them. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the boundary-setting and self-compassion techniques we discussed. I've had some successes, but I'm still struggling with consistency, especially when it comes to thought records. My mood has been up and down, but I do feel a bit more hopeful overall.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've had some successes with boundary-setting and self-compassion, and that you're feeling a bit more hopeful. Consistency can be challenging, especially when it comes to thought records. We can definitely explore that further today. Before we set our agenda, can you share a bit more about your experiences with the Positive Data Log? How has it been collecting evidence for the new core belief, \"I am good enough, and my needs matter\"?\n\nPatient: The Positive Data Log has been an interesting exercise. I've been trying to notice moments when I prioritize my own needs or when others respond positively to my boundaries. It's not always easy to remember to write things down, but when I do, it helps me see that there is evidence for this new belief. At the same time, I still find myself questioning whether I'm really \"good enough\" and whether my needs truly matter.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Jamie. Recognizing the moments that support your new core belief is an important step in the process of changing those deeply held beliefs. It's also completely normal to have doubts and questions along the way. We can definitely explore those doubts further and continue building evidence for your new core belief. \n\nGiven what you've shared, here are some topics I think could be helpful to focus on today:\n1. Reviewing your experiences with boundary-setting and self-compassion practices\n2. Discussing strategies to make thought records more manageable and consistent\n3. Exploring the doubts and questions that come up around your new core belief\n4. Continuing to build evidence for your new core belief using the Positive Data Log\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or focus on today?",
