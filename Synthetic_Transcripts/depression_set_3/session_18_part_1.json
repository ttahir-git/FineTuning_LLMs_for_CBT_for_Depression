  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times, and I want you to feel comfortable letting me know if something doesn't seem quite right. Additionally, as an AI, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm not able to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so I'll be relying on your openness and honesty in sharing your thoughts and feelings with me. With all that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards improved mental health and well-being. How are you feeling today, and what's been on your mind since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. Some days have been better than others, but overall, I feel like I'm making progress, even if it's slow at times. I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned, like adding to my Positive Data Log and practicing thought records, but it hasn't always been easy. I find myself struggling with the idea of prioritizing my own needs and setting boundaries, especially when it comes to my family and cultural background. It's like there's this constant voice in my head telling me that I'm being selfish or that I'm not doing enough for others.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to experience a range of emotions and to face challenges while working on these skills, Jamie. I'm glad to hear that you've noticed some progress, even if it feels slow at times. Remember, change takes time, and every small step counts. I appreciate you sharing your struggles with prioritizing your own needs and setting boundaries, especially in the context of your family and cultural background. These beliefs and expectations can be deeply ingrained, and it takes courage to challenge them. Let's explore this further today. What would you like to focus on in our session? We can review your homework, discuss the challenges you've faced, and work on strengthening your new core belief.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on setting boundaries and challenging that voice in my head that tells me I'm being selfish. It's something that keeps coming up for me, and I feel like it's holding me back from truly prioritizing my own needs and well-being.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great focus for today's session, Jamie. Setting boundaries and challenging those negative self-beliefs can be difficult, but it's an important step in asserting your own needs and values. Let's start by reviewing your Positive Data Log and thought records to see how you've been applying these skills in your daily life. Then, we can explore some strategies for setting boundaries and reframing those negative thoughts. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I'm ready to dive in.",
