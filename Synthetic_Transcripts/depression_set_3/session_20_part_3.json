  "transcript": "Patient: Considering that evidence does make me question the validity of my initial thought. It's not always true that people will think I'm selfish for prioritizing my needs. But it's still hard to shake that belief, especially when I'm in the moment and feeling pressured to say yes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Jamie. Challenging these deeply ingrained beliefs takes practice and persistence. It's not always easy to do in the heat of the moment. That's where having a coping card can be helpful. Did you have a chance to use your coping card this week, with the new affirmations we added about maintaining progress after therapy?\n\nPatient: I did look at it a few times, especially when I was struggling with the thought of our sessions ending. The affirmations helped a bit, reminding me that I've made progress and that I have the tools to keep moving forward. But I still feel anxious about not having this regular support.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel anxious about the end of therapy. It's a big transition, and it's natural to worry about maintaining your progress on your own. That's why I want to make sure we spend some time today creating a relapse prevention plan and a wellness action plan. These will be your roadmaps for navigating challenges and setbacks after our sessions end.\n\nPatient: That sounds really helpful. I like the idea of having a plan to fall back on when things get tough.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. The relapse prevention plan will outline the signs to look out for that might indicate your depression symptoms are worsening. It will also include a list of coping strategies and resources you can turn to if you need support. The wellness action plan, on the other hand, will focus on the positive steps you can take to maintain your well-being and continue building on the progress you've made.\n\nPatient: I think having both of those plans will give me a sense of direction and control. Can we start working on them now?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Let's begin with the relapse prevention plan. One of the first steps is identifying your early warning signs - the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that might indicate your depression is starting to worsen. Based on what you've shared with me, what do you think some of your early warning signs might be?\n\nPatient: I think one early warning sign for me is when I start isolating myself more and avoiding social interactions. Another sign is when I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning and lose motivation to do things I usually enjoy, like playing music.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of early warning signs. Isolating yourself and losing interest in activities you typically enjoy can be red flags that your depression might be worsening. What about thoughts? Are there any specific thought patterns that tend to come up when you're starting to struggle more?\n\nPatient: Definitely. I start having more of those self-critical thoughts, like \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I'm letting everyone down.\" I also tend to ruminate more on negative experiences and mistakes I've made.\n\nTherapist: You're identifying some key cognitive distortions there, like all-or-nothing thinking and overgeneralization. Those types of thought patterns can definitely contribute to a downward spiral. It's great that you're able to recognize them as potential warning signs. Now, let's think about some coping strategies you can use when you notice these signs popping up. What has worked for you in the past?\n\nPatient: When I'm starting to feel down, it helps to reach out to my close friends, even if I don't feel like it at first. Talking to someone who understands and validates my feelings can make a big difference. I also find that engaging in creative activities, like playing music or writing in my journal, can help shift my mood.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent coping strategies. Connecting with supportive people and engaging in activities that bring you joy and meaning can be powerful tools in managing your depression symptoms. Another important strategy is using your CBT skills, like doing thought records or referring to your coping card. These tools can help you challenge those negative thought patterns and reframe your perspective.\n\nPatient: You're right. I need to remember to use the skills I've learned, even when it feels hard. It's just difficult to motivate myself to do it sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. Motivation can be a challenge, especially when you're feeling depressed. That's where having a solid plan in place can help. We can outline specific steps you can take when you notice your early warning signs, like setting a small goal to reach out to a friend or committing to doing a thought record once a day. Breaking it down into manageable steps can make it feel less overwhelming.",
