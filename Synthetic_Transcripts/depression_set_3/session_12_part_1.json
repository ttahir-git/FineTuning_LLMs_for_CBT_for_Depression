  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for our 12th session. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'd love to hear how you've been doing since our last session. Can you tell me a bit about your mood and any significant experiences you've had over the past week?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. This past week has been a mix of ups and downs. I had some really nice moments with my child, but I also struggled with motivation and low mood at times. I did my best to practice the techniques we discussed, like tolerating uncertainty and focusing on the present moment.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you had some positive moments with your child, Jamie. The ups and downs you mentioned are a normal part of the process. I'm glad you've been practicing the techniques we discussed. Can you share a bit more about your experience with tolerating uncertainty and focusing on the present moment? What worked well, and what did you find challenging?\n\nPatient: Focusing on the present moment was helpful when I found myself getting caught up in worries about my child's college decision. I tried to remind myself that I can't control the future and that the best thing I can do is be present and supportive in the moment. But tolerating uncertainty is still really hard for me. I find myself wanting to plan and prepare for every possible outcome, even though I know that's not realistic.\n\nTherapist: You're making an important insight, Jamie. Recognizing that you can't control the future and that the best thing you can do is be present and supportive is a significant step. Tolerating uncertainty is a skill that takes practice, and it's normal to find it challenging at times. Remember that it's about accepting that uncertainty is a part of life and learning to sit with the discomfort it brings, rather than trying to eliminate it entirely.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just need to keep practicing and reminding myself that uncertainty is inevitable.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. It's a process of building that mental muscle over time. Now, let's take a look at the agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it could be helpful to discuss your experience with thought records and any challenges you encountered with that. We can also explore how your cultural background and family experiences might be influencing your beliefs and behaviors around setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care. What do you think about that? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I definitely want to talk more about the thought records because I did find them challenging. And I think exploring how my cultural background and family experiences are influencing my beliefs and behaviors could be really helpful. I've been thinking a lot about that lately.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start with the thought records then. Can you tell me more about the challenges you encountered when practicing them over the past week?\n\nPatient: Well, I found it hard to identify my automatic thoughts sometimes. And even when I could identify them, I struggled to come up with alternative thoughts that felt believable to me.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Jamie. Identifying automatic thoughts can take practice, and it's okay if it feels difficult at first. When you're having trouble identifying them, it can be helpful to ask yourself questions like, \"What was going through my mind just before I started feeling this way?\" or \"If someone asked me what I was thinking, what would I tell them?\" \n\nAs for generating alternative thoughts, it's not about coming up with something that feels 100% believable right away. It's about considering other perspectives and looking for evidence that might support a different way of thinking. Remember the strategies we discussed, like considering what you would say to a friend in a similar situation or identifying cognitive distortions.",
