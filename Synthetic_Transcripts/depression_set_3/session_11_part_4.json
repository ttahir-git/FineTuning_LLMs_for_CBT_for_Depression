  "transcript": "Patient: Thank you for this perspective. I feel like I have some concrete strategies to try now when I start to feel anxious about the college decision and the transition.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. Remember, it's a process and it's okay if it takes time and practice. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you navigate this transition. It's also okay to lean on your support system, whether that's friends, family, or a therapist, when you need some extra help or guidance.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling now. What are some of the main takeaways or insights you're leaving with today?\n\nPatient: I feel more equipped to handle the challenges with thought records and the anxiety around my child's college decision. I appreciate you breaking down the steps and helping me identify the cognitive distortions that might be getting in my way. I also feel more empowered to focus on the present moment and the opportunities I have now to connect with my child, rather than getting too caught up in worries about the future.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more equipped and empowered. Those are important shifts in perspective. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there may be ups and downs along the way. The important thing is that you keep showing up for yourself and putting in the effort to challenge these negative thoughts and beliefs. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the thought records, using the strategies we discussed today. Try to catch yourself when you notice cognitive distortions like discounting the positive or all-or-nothing thinking, and practice challenging those thoughts with evidence and alternative perspectives. I also encourage you to practice tolerating uncertainty and focusing on the present moment, especially when it comes to your child's college decision. Finally, consider setting aside some dedicated time to connect with your child and have open conversations about your hopes and fears around this transition.\n\nPatient: That all sounds good. I appreciate having specific tasks to focus on. I'll do my best to practice these strategies and be patient with myself in the process.\n\nTherapist: That's all we can ask of ourselves \u2013 to do our best and be patient with the process. I'm confident that with continued practice and self-compassion, you'll start to see some shifts in your thought patterns and anxiety levels. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. Lean on your support system and don't hesitate to reach out if you need some extra guidance or encouragement.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I will. I'm grateful for your support and guidance through this process.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. I'm here for you every step of the way. Let's plan to meet again next week to check in on your progress and explore any challenges that come up. In the meantime, take care of yourself and remember to celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\nSession Summary:\nMain topics discussed:\n- Challenges with thought records and strategies to make them more manageable\n- Anxiety around child's college decision and strategies to manage uncertainty and focus on the present moment\n- Reframing the transition as an opportunity for growth and evolution in the parent-child relationship\n\nTechniques or exercises used:\n- Thought records: Reviewed challenges and discussed strategies to make the process more manageable, such as considering what you would say to a friend in a similar situation and identifying cognitive distortions\n- Tolerating uncertainty: Discussed the importance of accepting inherent unknowability and sitting with the discomfort of uncertainty\n- Focusing on the present moment: Encouraged being intentional about spending quality time with child and having open conversations about hopes and fears around the transition\n- Reframing: Practiced reframing the transition as an opportunity for growth and evolution in the relationship rather than a loss\n\nHomework assigned:\n1.
