  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me, Nova. I don't have anything else to add at the moment.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your experience with setting boundaries. You mentioned that you tried setting a small boundary with a friend, and it went better than expected. Can you tell me more about that situation and how it made you feel?\n\nPatient: Sure. My friend asked me to help them move some furniture on a day when I had already made plans for some much-needed self-care time. Normally, I would have canceled my plans and agreed to help them, but this time, I politely told them that I had already made commitments and wouldn't be able to help. They were understanding and said they'd find someone else to help. It made me feel relieved and a bit more in control of my own time and needs.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of setting a healthy boundary, Jamie. By asserting your needs and prioritizing your self-care, you challenged the intermediate belief that you must always put others' needs before your own. How did it feel to go against that belief?\n\nPatient: It felt a bit uncomfortable at first, because I'm so used to saying yes to everyone. But after the initial discomfort, I felt a sense of relief and even a bit of pride for standing up for myself. It made me realize that setting boundaries doesn't mean I'm being selfish or that others will reject me.\n\nTherapist: That's an important insight, Jamie. Challenging long-held beliefs can feel uncomfortable at first, but as you experienced, it can lead to positive outcomes and a greater sense of self-worth. Let's continue to explore this in our work together.\n\nNow, let's discuss strategies for managing overwhelming negative thoughts and making the thought record process more manageable. You mentioned that focusing on the most distressing thought first might be helpful. Can you think of a recent situation where you could apply this strategy?\n\nPatient: Yes, just the other day, I was feeling overwhelmed by thoughts like \"I'm not doing enough for my child,\" \"I'm a bad parent,\" and \"I'm failing at everything.\" It felt like a barrage of negative thoughts all at once.\n\nTherapist: That sounds really challenging, Jamie. When you have multiple negative thoughts like that, it can be helpful to identify the most distressing one and focus on that first. Of the thoughts you mentioned, which one felt the most distressing or had the strongest emotional impact?\n\nPatient: I think the thought \"I'm a bad parent\" felt the most distressing. It's tied to my core belief of \"I'm not good enough,\" and it hits me on a deep emotional level.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's focus on that thought. When you have a thought like \"I'm a bad parent,\" what emotions do you feel, and how intense are they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I feel a mix of sadness, guilt, and shame. The intensity is probably around 80-85.\n\nTherapist: Those are strong emotions, Jamie. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm a bad parent.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I sometimes struggle to set boundaries with my child, and I feel like I'm not always as present or attentive as I should be. I also compare myself to other parents who seem to have it all together, and I feel like I'm falling short.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have that goes against the thought \"I'm a bad parent\"?\n\nPatient: When I really think about it, there's quite a bit of evidence against that thought. My child is doing well in school, has friends, and is generally happy. I make sure they have what they need, and I try to be supportive and loving. I may not be perfect, but I'm doing my best.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Jamie. You've identified evidence that challenges the thought \"I'm a bad parent.\" When you consider this evidence, how does it impact the intensity of the emotions you feel?\n\nPatient: When I look at the evidence against the thought, the intensity of the sadness, guilt, and shame decreases. It's probably more like 50-55 now.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant decrease in intensity, Jamie. This shows how examining the evidence for and against our negative thoughts can help us see things in a more balanced way and reduce the emotional impact. As we continue with the thought records, remember to focus on one thought at a time and really examine the evidence on both sides.",
