  "transcript": "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job, Jamie. I appreciate your willingness to share your experiences and work through these challenges together. Now, let's explore how your cultural background and family experiences may be influencing your beliefs and behaviors around setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care.\n\nPatient: Growing up in a conservative East Asian family, there was always an emphasis on putting others' needs before your own. I was taught that being selfless and accommodating was a virtue, and that asserting my own needs was selfish.\n\nTherapist: That's a valuable insight, Jamie. It's common for cultural and familial messages to shape our beliefs and behaviors, sometimes in ways that can be detrimental to our well-being. Can you think of a specific situation where you found it challenging to set boundaries or prioritize self-care due to these beliefs?\n\nPatient: Recently, my parents asked me to help organize a family gathering, even though I had already made plans for some much-needed alone time. I felt guilty saying no, and ended up canceling my plans to help them, even though it left me feeling drained and resentful.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Jamie. Let's break down this situation using the CBT triangle. What thoughts and emotions did you experience when your parents asked for your help, and how did those influence your behavior?\n\nPatient: When they asked, I thought, \"If I don't help, they'll think I'm selfish and ungrateful.\" I felt guilty and anxious, which led me to cancel my plans and agree to help, even though it wasn't what I truly wanted.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. Now, let's explore the intermediate and core beliefs that may be underlying these thoughts and emotions. What deeper beliefs might be driving the thought that your parents will think you're selfish and ungrateful if you don't help?\n\nPatient: I think there's a core belief that \"I'm not good enough,\" and an intermediate belief that \"I must always put others' needs before my own to be accepted and loved.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are powerful beliefs, Jamie, and they can make it very difficult to set boundaries and prioritize self-care. Let's challenge these beliefs using the evidence you've gathered through your recent experiences with boundary-setting.\n\nPatient: Well, when I set boundaries with my sibling, they didn't react negatively. In fact, they expressed understanding and respect for my needs. That's evidence against the belief that I must always put others' needs first to be accepted.\n\nTherapist: Excellent observation, Jamie. That's a strong piece of evidence against your intermediate belief. Now, let's introduce a new technique called the \"Positive Data Log\" to help you accumulate more evidence for a more balanced and adaptive core belief. The idea is to actively look for and record experiences that support a new, healthier core belief, such as \"I am good enough, and my needs matter.\"\n\nPatient: I like the sound of that. How do I go about creating a Positive Data Log?\n\nTherapist: To create a Positive Data Log, start by identifying a new, more adaptive core belief you want to reinforce, such as \"I am good enough, and my needs matter.\" Then, throughout your day, pay attention to experiences, interactions, or moments that provide evidence for this new belief. Record these experiences in your log, along with a brief description of how they support the new belief.\n\nFor example, you might write: \"My sibling expressed understanding when I set a boundary. This supports the belief that my needs matter and setting boundaries doesn't lead to rejection.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I think this could be a helpful tool for me to start shifting my core beliefs.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find it helpful, Jamie. Remember, the goal is to actively seek out and record evidence that supports your new, more balanced core belief. Over time, this can help you develop a more compassionate and accepting relationship with yourself.",
