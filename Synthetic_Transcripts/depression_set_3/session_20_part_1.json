  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I strive to provide evidence-based support, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a chance I could generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to supporting you in our work together. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand and appreciate you sharing those limitations. It's been an up and down week for me. I've had some good moments where I felt more hopeful and motivated, but also some tough days where I struggled with low mood and self-doubt. I tried to keep up with the homework assignments, but it wasn't always easy.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're aware of both the positive moments and the challenges you faced this past week. It's common to have ups and downs, especially when working on making meaningful changes. Can you share a bit more about what made it difficult to engage with the homework at times?\n\nPatient: Well, I find it hard to prioritize my own needs and set boundaries with others, even though I know it's important for my well-being. I get caught up in worrying about disappointing people or not being there for them. It's like I have this belief that I'm only worthy if I'm constantly sacrificing for others.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. This belief that your worth is tied to sacrificing for others seems to be a core belief that we've been working on challenging throughout our sessions. I'm curious, how did this belief impact your mood and behavior this past week?\n\nPatient: When I act on that belief and put everyone else's needs before my own, I end up feeling exhausted, resentful, and down on myself. I neglect my own self-care and the things that bring me joy, like playing music or reading. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, it is a cycle. Our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. The more you prioritize others at the expense of your own well-being, the more it reinforces that core belief and leads to those difficult emotions. Let's make sure to address this cycle as we set our agenda for today. What else would you like to prioritize in our session?\n\nPatient: I definitely want to talk more about challenging that core belief and finding ways to set healthier boundaries. I also want to discuss how I can maintain my progress after our sessions end. I'm feeling a bit anxious about not having this regular support.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. We can explore strategies for setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care, and we can also work on developing a relapse prevention plan to help you maintain your progress independently. I want to make sure we also save some time to review your homework and discuss any successes or challenges you had with the Positive Data Log, thought records, and using your coping card. How does that sound for an agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think it covers the main things I'm struggling with right now.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your homework. Can you share some entries from your Positive Data Log where you were able to prioritize your own needs and the positive outcomes that followed?",
