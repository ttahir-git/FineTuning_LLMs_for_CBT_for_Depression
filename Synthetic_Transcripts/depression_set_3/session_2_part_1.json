  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's good to see you again. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and sometimes I might generate inaccurate responses. I also can't provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't observe non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: I'm doing alright, thanks for asking. I understand the limitations you mentioned. I'm just hoping to make some progress in managing my depression.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you're open to working together despite those limitations. Before we review your homework, let's set an agenda for today's session. I think it would be helpful to start by discussing the thought record you kept over the past week and exploring any patterns or insights that emerged. We can also continue building on the CBT framework we introduced last time, focusing on how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. Does that sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the patterns in my thought record. I don't have anything else to add to the agenda right now.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your thought record then. Can you share some of the situations, emotions, and thoughts you wrote down over the past week?",
