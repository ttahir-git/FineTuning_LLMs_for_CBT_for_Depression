  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some excellent points, Jamie. Let's continue to explore how you can apply the techniques we've discussed to challenge your long-held beliefs and prioritize your own needs. I'd like to introduce a new concept called \"meta-thought records.\" This involves completing thought records about the experience of CBT itself and the progress you've made. It can help address any concerns or anxieties you may have about ending therapy. What do you think about giving it a try?\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. I'm a bit nervous about ending therapy, so maybe this could help me work through those feelings.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Let's start by identifying any negative thoughts you have about ending therapy. What comes to mind?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm worried that I'll slip back into old patterns once I'm not coming to sessions anymore. Like, what if I can't keep up with using the skills on my own?\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern. Let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that you might slip back into old patterns?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been in therapy for a while now, and I still struggle with prioritizing my own needs sometimes. It's hard to imagine doing it all on my own.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against that thought? What progress have you made that suggests you can continue using these skills independently?\n\nPatient: I guess I have been able to set some boundaries and challenge my negative beliefs, like with the example of going to my support group. And I've been using my coping card and thought records more regularly.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of progress. It shows that you're internalizing the skills and using them even outside of sessions. Another piece of evidence is that we'll create a relapse prevention plan together. This will outline steps you can take if you start to feel yourself slipping back into old patterns. It's like a roadmap for maintaining your progress.\n\nPatient: That does make me feel a bit better. I like the idea of having a plan to fall back on.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And we'll also create a \"wellness action plan\" that outlines steps to take if you start to notice your depression symptoms worsening. It's all about being proactive and having strategies in place.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just need to keep reminding myself that I have the tools and the support, even if I'm not in therapy anymore.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. And that's where your coping card can come in handy. We can add some affirmations related to your ability to maintain progress after therapy. What's an affirmation you could tell yourself in those moments of doubt?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I have the skills and the strength to prioritize my own needs, even when it's challenging. I can reach out for support when I need it.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic affirmation. Let's add that to your coping card. And remember, you can always come back for periodic \"booster\" sessions if you need a refresher or some extra support.\n\nPatient: That's good to know. I think I'm feeling a bit more confident about ending therapy now.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Before we wrap up, let's do a quick check-in on your current mood and any final thoughts you have about today's session.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful and empowered, I think. It's still a bit scary to think about ending therapy, but I know I have the tools and the support to keep making progress.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Jamie. Remember, progress isn't always linear. There may be ups and downs, but what matters is that you keep using the skills you've learned and reaching out for support when needed.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate all your help and guidance throughout this process.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. I'm so proud of the progress you've made and the work you've put in. Remember, this is a journey, and you have the strength and resilience to keep moving forward.\n\nPatient: Thank you. That means a lot.\n\nTherapist: Before we end, let's assign some homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue adding to your Positive Data Log, noting instances where you prioritize your own needs and the positive outcomes that follow. Keep practicing your thought records, focusing on challenging the belief that you must always put others' needs first. And use your coping card, including the new affirmations we added today, when you're struggling with negative thoughts or feeling guilty for asserting your needs.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. I'll keep working on those things.\n\nTherapist: Great. And if you have any questions or concerns before our next session, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I'll see you next week.\n\nTherapist: See you then, Jamie.
