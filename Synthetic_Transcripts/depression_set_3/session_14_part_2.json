  "transcript": "Therapist: It's understandable how those early experiences and cultural values have shaped your beliefs around setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs. The guilt and fear of being seen as selfish can be powerful barriers to self-care. In CBT, we often talk about cognitive distortions, which are biased or irrational ways of thinking that can contribute to emotional distress. One common distortion is \"should statements,\" where we have rigid rules about how we or others \"should\" behave. It sounds like you may have some \"should statements\" around always putting others' needs first. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I definitely recognize that I have a lot of \"should statements\" when it comes to prioritizing others' needs. I often catch myself thinking, \"I should be available whenever my family needs me\" or \"I shouldn't say no to a request for help, even if I'm exhausted.\" These thoughts make it hard for me to set boundaries without feeling guilty.\n\nTherapist: You're not alone in struggling with \"should statements.\" They can be very deeply ingrained, especially when they're tied to cultural or family values. One way to start challenging these thoughts is to reframe them as preferences rather than absolutes. For example, instead of \"I should always put others' needs first,\" you could say, \"I value being supportive to others, but sometimes I need to prioritize my own well-being too.\" How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: Reframing \"should statements\" as preferences does make them feel a bit less rigid and all-or-nothing. I like the idea of acknowledging my values while also recognizing the importance of self-care. It's just hard to put that into practice when I'm in the moment and feeling pressured to say yes to something.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. Reframing thoughts is a helpful first step, but it's also important to practice setting boundaries in real-life situations. One strategy we can discuss is using \"I statements\" to assert your needs in a clear and non-confrontational way. For example, \"I appreciate that you need help with this project, but I'm feeling overwhelmed with my own workload right now and need to prioritize that.\" How do you think that approach might work for you?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of using \"I statements.\" It feels less accusatory than saying something like \"You're asking too much of me.\" I think practicing those kinds of phrases could help me feel more comfortable setting boundaries in the moment. It's still scary to think about how others might react, though.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel anxious about setting boundaries, especially if you're not used to doing it. One way to build confidence is to start small and gradually work up to more challenging situations. For example, you could practice saying no to a small request from a friend or family member and see how it goes. We can also role-play some boundary-setting conversations in our sessions to help you feel more prepared. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: Starting small and practicing in session sounds like a good plan. I think I would feel more confident if I had some successes under my belt, even if they're in lower-stakes situations. And role-playing could help me find the right words to use when I'm feeling put on the spot.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that approach resonates with you. Building up your boundary-setting skills gradually can make the process feel less overwhelming. As you practice, it's also helpful to remember that setting boundaries is a way of honoring your own needs and well-being, not a sign of selfishness or weakness. It's about finding a balance between supporting others and taking care of yourself. What thoughts come up for you when I say that?\n\nPatient: When you frame it that way, setting boundaries does feel more like an act of self-care rather than selfishness. I guess I've always seen it as a binary choice \u2013 either I'm completely selfless or completely selfish. But it's more nuanced than that. It's about finding a middle ground where I can be supportive without sacrificing my own well-being.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Finding that middle ground is key. It's not about swinging to the opposite extreme of always putting your own needs first, but rather recognizing that your needs matter too. As you practice setting boundaries, it can be helpful to remind yourself of that balanced perspective. You're not being selfish; you're taking care of yourself so that you can show up more fully for others in the long run.",
