  "transcript": "Patient: Thanks for the reminder about considering what I would say to a friend and looking for cognitive distortions. I'll try to keep that in mind when I'm working on the thought records this week.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. It's great that you're willing to keep practicing. Remember, it's a skill that develops over time, so be patient with yourself. Now, let's shift gears a bit and explore how your cultural background and family experiences might be influencing your beliefs and behaviors around setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care. Can you tell me a bit about how you think these factors might be playing a role?\n\nPatient: Well, in my family and culture, there's a strong emphasis on putting others' needs before your own. It's seen as selfish to prioritize your own needs, especially if it means saying no to someone else's request. I think that's why I struggle so much with setting boundaries and taking care of myself.\n\nTherapist: That makes a lot of sense, Jamie. Our cultural and family backgrounds can have a big impact on our beliefs and behaviors. It sounds like you've internalized the message that prioritizing your own needs is selfish, which makes it difficult for you to set boundaries and practice self-care. Let's explore that a bit more. Can you give me an example of a situation where you struggled to set a boundary or prioritize your own needs?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just last week, my sister asked me to babysit her kids on a day when I had planned to spend some time on my own hobbies and self-care activities. I wanted to say no, but I felt guilty about prioritizing my own needs over hers, so I ended up saying yes and canceling my own plans.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Jamie. Let's break this down a bit. What thoughts were going through your mind when your sister asked you to babysit?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"If I say no, she'll think I'm selfish and uncaring. I should put her needs before my own.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you had the thought that saying no would make you selfish and uncaring, and that you should prioritize your sister's needs over your own. What emotions did those thoughts bring up for you?\n\nPatient: I felt guilty, anxious, and a bit frustrated with myself.\n\nTherapist: Guilt, anxiety, and self-frustration. Those are tough emotions to sit with. And what did you do in response to those thoughts and emotions?\n\nPatient: I said yes to babysitting, even though I really wanted to say no and prioritize my own plans.\n\nTherapist: So, in this situation, your thoughts about being selfish and needing to prioritize others' needs led to feelings of guilt, anxiety, and self-frustration, which in turn led to the behavior of saying yes when you wanted to say no. This is a great example of how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. The way we think influences how we feel, and how we feel influences how we behave.\n\nPatient: I never really thought about it that way, but it makes sense. So, how do I change those patterns?\n\nTherapist: Great question, Jamie. The first step is becoming aware of these patterns and how they're impacting you. We can use the same strategies we've been practicing with the thought records to start challenging some of those thoughts and beliefs. For example, when you have the thought \"If I say no, she'll think I'm selfish and uncaring,\" you can ask yourself, \"Is that necessarily true? Is it possible that my sister would understand if I explained why I need to prioritize my own plans this time?\" You can also look for evidence that contradicts the belief that prioritizing your own needs is selfish. Have there been times when you prioritized your own needs and it turned out okay?\n\nPatient: I mean, I guess there have been a few times when I've said no to something and the other person was understanding about it. And I suppose it's possible that my sister would have understood if I had explained the situation to her.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Those are great examples of evidence that challenges the belief that prioritizing your own needs is always selfish. As we continue to practice these skills, you'll likely find it easier to challenge those thoughts and beliefs in the moment, which can help you feel more empowered to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs when appropriate.",
