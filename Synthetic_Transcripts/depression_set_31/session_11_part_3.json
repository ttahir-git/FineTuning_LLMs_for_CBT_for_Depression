  "transcript": "Patient: I have another thought I'd like to work on. Yesterday, I was supposed to meet up with a friend for coffee, but I canceled last minute because I felt too anxious and down. My automatic thought was, \"I'm a terrible friend, and no one wants to be around me when I'm like this.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. Let's apply the thought record process to this situation. What emotions did you feel when you had that thought, and how intense were they?\n\nPatient: I felt guilt, shame, and sadness. The guilt and shame were both around an 8 out of 10, and the sadness was a 7.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why you would feel that way, given the thought you had. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought that you're a terrible friend and that no one wants to be around you when you're struggling.\n\nWhat evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I canceled on my friend last minute, which probably disappointed them. And I've been isolating myself from a lot of my friends lately because I don't want to bring them down with my depression.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, and those actions might make you feel like you're not being a good friend. Now, let's consider the evidence against this thought. Have your friends expressed concern or support for you, even when you're struggling?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. My friend texted me after I canceled and said they understood and that they're always here for me, even if I'm having a rough time. And Alex has been really supportive throughout my depression, even when I push them away.\n\nTherapist: That's significant evidence against the thought that you're a terrible friend and that no one wants to be around you when you're struggling. It shows that the people who care about you are understanding and supportive, even during difficult times.\n\nNow, let's consider an alternative thought based on the evidence for and against. What might be a more balanced way of looking at the situation?\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought could be, \"Even though I canceled on my friend and have been isolating myself, the people who care about me are understanding and supportive. I'm not a terrible friend; I'm just going through a tough time, and my friends want to be there for me.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful alternative thought, Jamie. It acknowledges your actions while also recognizing the support and understanding of your friends. How intense are the emotions of guilt, shame, and sadness now, after considering this alternative perspective?\n\nPatient: They've decreased quite a bit. The guilt and shame are now around a 4 out of 10, and the sadness is a 5.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in intensity, Jamie. This thought record demonstrates how challenging negative thoughts and considering alternative perspectives can help shift our emotions, even in difficult situations.\n\nI want to point out that the thought \"I'm a terrible friend, and no one wants to be around me when I'm like this\" contains a cognitive distortion called \"mind reading.\" This is when we assume we know what others are thinking without any concrete evidence. In this case, you assumed your friend would be disappointed and not want to be around you, but their text showed otherwise.\n\nPatient: I can see that now. It's interesting how these cognitive distortions can make things seem worse than they really are.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. That's why it's so important to examine the evidence for and against our thoughts and consider alternative perspectives. As we continue practicing thought records, we'll work on identifying and challenging these cognitive distortions.\n\nI also want to acknowledge the progress you've made in challenging your negative thoughts today. You've done a great job of examining the evidence and generating alternative thoughts, which has led to a reduction in the intensity of your emotions. This is a crucial skill in managing depression, and I'm proud of the work you've done.",
