  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to remind you that while I'm here to support you, I do have some limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me, and there's a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to working with you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your commitment to helping me. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and behavioral activation. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood when I engage in meaningful activities. However, I still struggle with feelings of guilt and shame related to productivity and self-worth.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements in your mood. It's completely normal to still experience challenges with feelings of guilt and shame. We'll continue working on those areas together. For today's session, what would you like to focus on? We could review your homework, discuss your experience with thought records and incorporating meaningful activities, or explore your feelings of guilt and shame in more depth.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to review my homework and discuss my experience with the thought records and meaningful activities. I've been trying to challenge my negative thoughts, but I sometimes find it difficult to come up with alternative perspectives. I'd also like to explore my feelings of guilt and shame more, as they seem to be a recurring theme for me.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan for today's session. We'll start by reviewing your homework and discussing your experience with the thought records and meaningful activities. Then, we'll dive deeper into your feelings of guilt and shame, and work on developing strategies to challenge those negative thoughts. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.",
