  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your experience with the thought records in more detail. Can you walk me through an example of a thought record you completed this week, focusing on a situation that triggered negative thoughts about your career or productivity?\n\nPatient: Sure. Earlier this week, I saw a post on social media about someone I went to high school with getting a big promotion at their job. It immediately made me feel like a failure in comparison. My emotions were intense feelings of worthlessness and shame, probably around an 8 out of 10. The automatic thought that came up was \"I'll never be successful like them because I'm not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. It's a great opportunity to practice challenging some of those negative thoughts. Let's start by looking at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'll never be successful like them because I'm not good enough.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the evidence that supports it is that I'm currently unemployed, and I've been struggling to find a job that feels fulfilling. I also often feel like I'm not living up to my family's expectations for my career.\n\nTherapist: Okay, that's an important perspective to acknowledge. Now, let's look at the evidence against this thought. What are some reasons why this thought might not be entirely accurate?\n\nPatient: Hmm, well, I suppose that success can be defined in many different ways, not just by having a high-powered career. I have had successes in other areas of my life, like my photography and my relationship with Alex. And just because I'm struggling right now doesn't mean I'll never be successful in the future.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. Success is multi-dimensional, and it's essential to recognize your achievements in other areas of your life. It's also important to remember that struggles are often temporary, and they don't define your entire future. Now, based on the evidence for and against, can you come up with an alternative thought that feels more balanced?\n\nPatient: I guess an alternative thought could be \"My current situation doesn't mean I'm a failure. Success looks different for everyone, and I have strengths and achievements in areas outside of my career. With time and effort, I can find a path that feels fulfilling for me.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought! It acknowledges the challenges you're facing while also recognizing your strengths and the potential for growth and change. How does your emotional intensity feel after coming up with this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: It definitely feels a bit lower, maybe around a 5 out of 10. I can see how challenging the negative thought and coming up with a more balanced perspective can help shift my mood.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful progress, Jamie. It's great that you're able to recognize the impact of challenging your negative thoughts. As we continue to practice this skill, it will likely become easier to generate alternative thoughts and experience more lasting shifts in your mood.\n\nNow, let's explore the feelings of guilt and shame that came up for you around productivity. Can you tell me more about what triggers those feelings and how they impact you?",
