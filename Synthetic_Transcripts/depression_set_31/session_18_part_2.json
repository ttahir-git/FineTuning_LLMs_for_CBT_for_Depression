  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me, Nova. I'm open to focusing on those key areas you mentioned. I don't have anything specific to add, but I appreciate you checking in with me.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's dive in then. First, I'd like to review your experience with the homework from our last session. You mentioned that you've been working on tracking your mood and energy levels and engaging in meaningful activities. Can you share more about how that's been going for you? What challenges have you faced, and what insights have you gained?\n\nPatient: Well, tracking my mood and energy levels has been helpful in making me more aware of my patterns. I've noticed that my energy tends to be lowest in the mornings, which makes it harder to get out of bed and start my day. As for the meaningful activities, I've been trying to do small things like taking a short walk or spending a few minutes on photography, like we discussed. It's not always easy to find the motivation, but I've noticed that when I do engage in these activities, I tend to feel a bit better afterwards.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation about your energy levels being lowest in the mornings, Jamie. Recognizing those patterns can help us develop strategies to work with them. For example, we could explore ways to make getting out of bed a bit easier, like setting a gentle alarm or having a comforting routine to look forward to.\n\nI'm glad to hear that engaging in meaningful activities has had a positive impact on your mood, even if it's challenging to find the motivation at times. That's a common experience, and it's okay to start small. Every little bit counts, and it's the consistent effort that makes a difference over time.\n\nYou also mentioned that you've been using thought records to challenge the thought \"What's the point? It's not going to make a difference anyway.\" Can you share more about your experience with that? How has it felt to challenge that thought, and what kind of evidence have you been using?\n\nPatient: Challenging that thought has been difficult, but also kind of eye-opening. When I take the time to really examine the evidence, I can see that there are moments when things do feel a bit better, even if it's just a small improvement. It's hard to hold onto that perspective when I'm feeling really low, but having the thought records to look back on helps me remember that there is some evidence against that hopeless thought.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Jamie. Challenging deeply ingrained thoughts takes practice and persistence, especially when we're feeling low. It's okay if it feels difficult at times. The fact that you're putting in the effort and finding some evidence against the hopeless thought is a significant step forward.\n\nI'd like to introduce a concept called \"cognitive distortions\" that can help us understand why certain thoughts might feel so convincing, even when there's evidence against them. Cognitive distortions are like mental filters or biases that can skew our perception of reality. One common distortion is called \"all-or-nothing thinking,\" where we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms.\n\nFor example, the thought \"What's the point? It's not going to make a difference anyway\" might be an example of all-or-nothing thinking. It suggests that if things aren't completely better, then nothing makes a difference at all. In reality, progress often happens in small, incremental steps, and every little bit counts.\n\nDoes that concept resonate with you at all? Can you think of any other examples where all-or-nothing thinking might show up in your experience?",
