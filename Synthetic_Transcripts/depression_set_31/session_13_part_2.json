  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying to do the thought records every day, but sometimes I find it hard to identify the evidence against my negative thoughts. It's like my mind just goes blank, and I can't think of anything positive.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge when working with thought records. When our minds are clouded by negative thoughts, it can be difficult to see past them and find evidence to the contrary. One strategy that can be helpful is to imagine what you might say to a close friend or loved one who was in a similar situation and had the same thoughts. We often find it easier to be compassionate and understanding with others than with ourselves. Can you think of a recent situation where you struggled to find evidence against your negative thoughts? Let's walk through it together and see if we can come up with some alternative perspectives.\n\nPatient: Sure, I remember a few days ago when I was trying to work on a photography project, but I just couldn't seem to get it right. I started thinking that I'm not good enough and that I'll never be successful in anything I do.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's break this down using the thought record. What emotions were you feeling in that moment, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I was feeling really frustrated, hopeless, and sad. I'd say the intensity was around 85 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: And what was the specific negative thought you identified?\n\nPatient: The thought was, \"I'm not good enough, and I'll never be successful in anything I do.\"\n\nTherapist: Now, let's look for evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I was struggling with the photography project, and I haven't been able to find a job in a long time. It feels like I'm not making progress in any area of my life.\n\nTherapist: I understand how those experiences can make you feel like you're not good enough. Now, let's try to find evidence against this thought. What would you say to a friend who was in a similar situation and expressed the same thought?\n\nPatient: I guess I would remind them that everyone struggles sometimes, and it doesn't mean they're not good enough. I'd probably point out their strengths and past successes, even if they're small.\n\nTherapist: That's a great perspective to take. Can you think of any strengths or past successes that challenge the thought that you're not good enough and will never be successful?\n\nPatient: I mean, I have had some good feedback on my photography in the past, and I did manage to complete a few projects that I was proud of. And I know that I'm a caring and supportive partner to Alex, even if I don't always feel like I'm doing enough.\n\nTherapist: Those are significant pieces of evidence against the negative thought. It's important to recognize that struggles and setbacks don't define your worth or your ability to be successful. Now, based on the evidence for and against the thought, what might be a more balanced and realistic alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"I may be struggling with this project right now, but that doesn't mean I'm not good enough or that I'll never be successful. I have had successes in the past, and I have strengths that I can rely on.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. It acknowledges the current struggle while also recognizing your past successes and strengths. How does the intensity of the emotions feel now, after coming up with this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: The intensity has gone down a bit. I'd say it's more like 60 out of 100 now.\n\nTherapist: That's progress! It shows that by challenging negative thoughts and finding evidence against them, we can start to shift our emotional state. This is a skill that takes practice, and the more you do it, the easier it will become to find alternative perspectives in the moment. Let's keep working on this throughout our sessions together.\n\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense. I'll keep trying to use the thought records, even when it feels tough.\n\nTherapist: That's great. Remember, it's okay if you don't always find the evidence against negative thoughts right away. The important thing is to keep practicing and be patient with yourself. Now, let's move on to discussing the meaningful activities you've been engaging in. How has that been going?",
