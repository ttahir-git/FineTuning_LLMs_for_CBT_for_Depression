You've been consistently practicing your CBT skills, challenging negative thoughts, and engaging in meaningful activities. These efforts are contributing to improvements in your mood and overall well-being. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are a normal part of the journey. The key is to keep applying your skills and reaching out for support when needed.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I know I still have work to do, but it feels good to recognize the small victories along the way.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Celebrating those victories is an essential part of maintaining your motivation and building confidence in your abilities. Before we end today's session, let's discuss your homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue practicing your thought records, focusing on challenging cognitive distortions related to your job search and self-worth. Additionally, keep engaging in meaningful activities and adding them to your \"small victories\" log. Finally, I encourage you to have that conversation with Alex about mutual support and schedule a regular check-in with each other.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll make sure to keep up with my thought records and meaningful activities. I'm also looking forward to talking with Alex and strengthening our support for each other.\n\nTherapist: Great! I'm confident that these steps will contribute to your ongoing progress. Remember, if you encounter any challenges or have questions, don't hesitate to bring them up in our next session. How are you feeling as we wrap up today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling more hopeful and motivated. I know there will be ups and downs, but I feel better equipped to handle them now.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Jamie. Your resilience and dedication to your mental health are truly inspiring. Let's plan to meet again next week at our usual time. In the meantime, take care of yourself and remember to celebrate your small victories.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your ongoing support.
