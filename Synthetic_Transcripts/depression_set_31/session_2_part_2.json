  "transcript": "Patient: That makes sense. I've never really thought about how my thoughts could be influencing my feelings and behaviors so much.\n\nTherapist: It's a powerful realization, and it's the foundation of CBT. By becoming more aware of our thoughts and learning to challenge and reframe them, we can start to shift our feelings and behaviors in a more positive direction. This is where the concept of \"cognitive distortions\" comes in. Cognitive distortions are inaccurate or irrational thought patterns that can contribute to negative emotions. Some common examples include all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, and jumping to conclusions.\n\nPatient: I think I might be guilty of some of those. Like, when I think \"I'm never going to get better,\" that's kind of jumping to conclusions, isn't it?\n\nTherapist: Exactly! That's a great insight, Jamie. When we say things like \"I'm never going to get better,\" we're making a prediction about the future based on how we feel in the moment, without considering other possibilities. This is a type of cognitive distortion called \"fortune telling.\" Another distortion that might be at play here is \"all-or-nothing thinking,\" where we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms. In this case, it might sound like \"If I'm not completely better, then I'm a total failure.\"\n\nPatient: Yeah, that definitely sounds familiar. I feel like I'm always putting that kind of pressure on myself.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, especially given your family background and the high expectations you've experienced. One of the goals of CBT is to help you recognize these cognitive distortions and learn to challenge them with more balanced, realistic thoughts. For example, instead of saying \"I'm never going to get better,\" you might try something like \"I'm struggling right now, but I'm taking steps to improve my mental health, and recovery is a process.\"\n\nPatient: That does sound more balanced. But it's hard to believe it sometimes, when I'm feeling really low.\n\nTherapist: That's a very common experience, Jamie. Challenging long-held beliefs and thought patterns takes practice and patience. It's not about trying to force yourself to think positively all the time, but rather learning to recognize when your thoughts might be distorted and finding more helpful ways to frame things. As we continue working together, we'll practice identifying and challenging these thoughts, and you'll start to build new, more adaptive thought patterns over time.\n\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense. I'm willing to give it a try.",
