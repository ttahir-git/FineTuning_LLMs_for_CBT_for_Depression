  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share a recent situation that triggered feelings of guilt and shame. A few days ago, I woke up feeling really low and couldn't bring myself to get out of bed. I had planned to work on some job applications, but I ended up spending most of the day in bed, just feeling overwhelmed and hopeless. I kept thinking, \"I'm such a failure. I can't even do the bare minimum to improve my situation.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. I can hear how much that experience impacted you. Let's explore this further using a thought record. First, can you tell me what emotions you were feeling in that moment and how intense they were on a scale of 0 to 100?\n\nPatient: I was feeling really sad, probably around 80 out of 100. I also felt guilty and ashamed, both around 90 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write that down. Now, you mentioned the thought, \"I'm such a failure. I can't even do the bare minimum to improve my situation.\" Let's look at the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been unemployed for months now, and I still haven't found a new job. I'm not even applying consistently. I feel like I'm not doing enough to change my situation.\n\nTherapist: I understand how that can make you feel like a failure. Now, let's look at the evidence against this thought. What are some things that challenge the idea that you're a failure?\n\nPatient: I guess I have been trying to work on my mental health, and that's not nothing. And I have been doing some photography projects here and there, even if they're not bringing in money.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you're able to recognize those efforts, Jamie. Let's add those to the evidence against the thought. Now, based on the evidence for and against, can you come up with an alternative thought that feels more balanced?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I'm struggling right now, but I'm taking steps to improve my mental health, and that's important too. Not being able to apply for jobs every day doesn't mean I'm a failure.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Jamie. It acknowledges your struggles while also recognizing the progress you're making. Now, let's re-rate the intensity of your emotions after considering this alternative thought.\n\nPatient: My sadness is probably around 60 now, and my guilt and shame are both around 70.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant decrease in intensity, Jamie. This shows how challenging our thoughts can help shift our emotions. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to catch and reframe negative thoughts in the moment.",
