  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for our 10th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the thought records and incorporating meaningful activities into my daily routine. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood. I'm still struggling with feelings of guilt and shame, especially when it comes to productivity and my sense of self-worth.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on the thought records and trying to engage in meaningful activities. It's okay if it feels challenging; progress takes time, and small improvements are still significant. I appreciate you sharing your ongoing struggles with guilt, shame, and self-worth. These are important areas for us to continue exploring together. Before we dive deeper, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize in our time together today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my feelings of guilt and shame, and how they're connected to my thoughts about productivity and self-worth. I also want to discuss how I can continue to improve my communication with Alex and lean on them for support.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Jamie. We can definitely explore the connection between your feelings of guilt and shame and your thoughts around productivity and self-worth. We can also discuss strategies for continuing to improve your communication with Alex and leaning on them for support. To start, let's focus on the guilt and shame you've been experiencing. Can you share a specific situation or thought that triggered these feelings recently?",
