  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share an example from earlier this week. I was sitting at home, trying to work on a photography project, but I couldn't seem to focus. I started feeling really down on myself, thinking \"I'm never going to finish this project. I'm just wasting my time.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Jamie. Let's break this down using a thought record. What emotions were you feeling in that moment, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I was feeling really frustrated and disappointed in myself. I'd say the intensity was around 80.\n\nTherapist: Okay, and what automatic thoughts came up for you in that situation?\n\nPatient: My main thought was \"I'm never going to finish this project. I'm just wasting my time.\" I also had thoughts like \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'll never be successful.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are some powerful thoughts. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm never going to finish this project. I'm just wasting my time.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I haven't made much progress on the project, and I keep getting distracted. I feel like I should be further along by now.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess I have made some progress, even if it's not as much as I'd like. And I know that creativity takes time. It's not always a linear process.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Jamie. Creativity does take time, and it's not always a straightforward path. Now, let's look at an alternative thought. Based on the evidence, what's a more balanced way of looking at this situation?\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought would be \"I'm making progress on my project, even if it's slower than I'd like. Taking breaks and allowing myself time to be creative is not a waste of time.\"\n\nTherapist: I really like that alternative thought, Jamie. It acknowledges the progress you've made and the importance of giving yourself time and space for creativity. Now, if you were to re-rate the intensity of your emotions with this alternative thought in mind, where would they be on that 0-100 scale?\n\nPatient: I think they'd be lower, maybe around 50. I still feel frustrated, but I don't feel as hopeless about the project.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, Jamie. This is a great example of how challenging our automatic thoughts can help us see situations in a more balanced way and reduce the intensity of our emotions. Let's keep practicing this skill with other situations you encountered this week.",
