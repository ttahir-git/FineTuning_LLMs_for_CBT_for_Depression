  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your support. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned. I've been doing the thought records and scheduling meaningful activities, but it's still a struggle. My mood has been up and down, and I've had moments where I feel really overwhelmed by guilt and shame.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Jamie. It's common to experience ups and downs throughout the therapy process. I'm glad to hear you've been working on the thought records and meaningful activities, even though it's been challenging. Can you tell me more about the moments when you felt overwhelmed by guilt and shame? What thoughts or situations triggered those feelings?\n\nPatient: It usually happens when I think about how unproductive I've been or when I compare myself to others who seem to be doing so much better than me. I start thinking that I'm a failure and that my life is meaningless because I'm not accomplishing anything.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts can be incredibly distressing and can really impact your mood. I want to explore this further, but first, let's set an agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to review your experience with the thought records and meaningful activities, and to continue working on challenging the core belief that \"I'm a failure, and my life is meaningless.\" We can also discuss strategies for managing the intense emotions that come up when you're feeling guilty or ashamed. Does that sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think it would also be helpful to talk about how I can be more consistent with the meaningful activities, because I struggle with motivation sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss strategies for staying motivated and consistent with the meaningful activities. Thank you for adding that to the agenda. Let's start by reviewing your experience with the thought records. Can you walk me through an example of a situation where you used a thought record to challenge your negative thoughts related to guilt and shame?",
