  "transcript": "Patient: Some activities that give me a sense of accomplishment are completing DIY projects around the house and helping my partner with their work when I can. As for pleasure, I used to enjoy photography and going for walks in nature, but I haven't done those things in a while.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've identified some activities that give you a sense of accomplishment and pleasure. Engaging in these activities more regularly can help counteract the negative effects of anxiety and depression. I understand that it might feel challenging to start doing things you used to enjoy, like photography and nature walks. We can work on gradually incorporating these activities back into your routine. What do you think about setting a small, achievable goal related to one of these activities for the coming week?\n\nPatient: I think that could be helpful. Maybe I could start by taking a short walk in the park near my house a couple of times this week. I used to really enjoy that, and it might help me feel more grounded and less anxious.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great goal to start with. Taking small, manageable steps is key to building momentum and increasing your engagement in enjoyable activities. As you mentioned earlier, you've been struggling with completing the thought records for homework. Can you tell me more about the challenges you've faced with this exercise?\n\nPatient: I find it hard to identify the evidence against my automatic thoughts. When I'm in that negative headspace, it feels like all the evidence supports the negative thoughts, and I can't see any other perspective.\n\nTherapist: It's common to struggle with finding evidence against automatic thoughts, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed by negative emotions. One strategy that can be helpful is to imagine what you might say to a close friend or loved one who was having similar thoughts. We often have more compassion and objectivity when it comes to others than we do for ourselves. Another approach is to consider whether you might be engaging in any cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking or overgeneralization. Let's practice this together with one of the thought records you completed for homework. Can you share an example of a situation where you had trouble finding evidence against your automatic thoughts?\n\nPatient: Sure, I had a situation this week where I applied for a job and didn't hear back. My automatic thought was, \"I'm never going to find a job I enjoy, and I'll be stuck in this rut forever.\" I couldn't think of any evidence against that thought because it feels like it's been true for so long.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. I can understand how that thought feels very true and convincing in the moment. Let's break this down together. First, let's consider if there might be any cognitive distortions at play. One distortion that stands out to me is \"fortune-telling,\" where you're predicting a negative outcome without evidence. Another might be \"all-or-nothing thinking,\" where you're seeing the situation as either you find a job you enjoy or you're stuck forever, without considering the possibility of a middle ground. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I can see how those distortions might be at play. It's hard to recognize them in the moment, but when you point them out, it makes sense.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're able to recognize the distortions when we discuss them. With practice, it will become easier to catch them in the moment. Now, let's try to find some evidence against the automatic thought. I know it feels true, but is there any evidence from your past experiences that might suggest otherwise? Have you ever been in a situation where you felt stuck, but eventually, things improved?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess there have been times in the past where I felt stuck, but eventually, I found a way to move forward. Like when I got laid off from my last job, I felt like I'd never find another one, but I did manage to find some temporary work after a few months.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of evidence against the automatic thought. It shows that even when you feel stuck, there have been times when things have improved, and you've been able to move forward. Another piece of evidence might be the fact that you're actively applying for jobs and taking steps to find work you enjoy, even if it hasn't happened yet. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: That's true. I guess I have been taking steps, even if they haven't led to the outcome I want yet. It's just hard to remember that when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's why practicing this skill is so important. The more you practice finding evidence against your automatic thoughts, the easier it will become to challenge them in the moment. I want to acknowledge that this is hard work, and you're doing a great job of engaging with the process. As we continue with therapy, we'll keep working on building these skills and finding ways to manage the anxiety and depression you've been experiencing.",
