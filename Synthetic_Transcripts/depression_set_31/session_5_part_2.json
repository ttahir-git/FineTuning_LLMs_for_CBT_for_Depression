  "transcript": "Patient: I'm glad we can focus on my career and future today. It's been weighing on me heavily, and I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts about it.\n\nTherapist: I understand how those negative thoughts can be overwhelming and contribute to feelings of being stuck. Let's explore this further. Can you share some of the specific thoughts you've been having about your career and future?\n\nPatient: Well, I keep thinking that I'm a failure because I haven't found a stable, successful career like my family expects me to. I feel like I'm letting them down and that I'll never be able to live up to their expectations. It makes me feel hopeless and like I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound very distressing, and it's clear how they contribute to your feelings of hopelessness and inadequacy. I want to acknowledge the pain and frustration these thoughts cause you. Let's examine them more closely. When you think, \"I'm a failure,\" what evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess the fact that I'm unemployed right now and haven't had a steady job for a while. I also compare myself to my siblings and friends who seem to have their lives together and are successful in their careers.\n\nTherapist: I see. Those are valid points, and it's common to compare ourselves to others. However, let's consider some evidence that doesn't support the thought that you're a failure. What are some strengths or accomplishments you have that challenge this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I do have my creative pursuits, like photography and DIY projects. I enjoy those and feel a sense of accomplishment when I complete a project. And I've had jobs in the past where I performed well and received positive feedback from my employers.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you're able to recognize those strengths and accomplishments. It shows that there's evidence against the thought that you're a failure. Let's look at another thought you mentioned: \"I'll never be able to live up to my family's expectations.\" What do you think is the impact of this thought on your emotions and behavior?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel anxious and like I'm not good enough. It also makes me want to avoid trying new things or pursuing my interests because I'm afraid of failing and disappointing them even more.\n\nTherapist: That's a valuable insight. This thought seems to contribute to feelings of anxiety and inadequacy, as well as avoidance behaviors. Let's explore this further. What do you think your family's expectations are based on, and how do they align with your own values and goals?",
