  "transcript": "Patient: When I think about my family's expectations, I realize they're based on their own experiences and values. They want me to have a stable, high-paying job because they think that's the key to happiness and success. But I'm not sure that aligns with my own values and goals. I want to do something creative and meaningful, even if it doesn't fit their definition of success.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Jamie. Recognizing that your family's expectations may not align with your own values and goals is a significant step in developing a healthier perspective. It's okay to have different definitions of success and happiness. Let's explore this further. What would a fulfilling and meaningful career look like for you, based on your own values and interests?\n\nPatient: I think a fulfilling career for me would involve using my creativity and helping others in some way. Maybe something related to photography or design, where I could work on projects that have a positive impact on people's lives. But I'm not sure how to make that happen or if it's even realistic.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're able to identify what a fulfilling career might look like for you. Your interests in photography and design, combined with your desire to help others, could lead to many meaningful opportunities. I understand it might feel daunting to figure out how to make it happen, but let's break it down into smaller steps. What are some actions you could take to explore these interests further and potentially turn them into a career?\n\nPatient: I guess I could start by researching different career paths related to photography and design. Maybe look for online courses or workshops to build my skills. And I could reach out to people in those fields to learn more about their experiences and get advice.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent ideas, Jamie. Taking small, concrete steps like researching, learning, and networking can help you gain clarity and confidence in pursuing a career that aligns with your values and interests. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take your time exploring different options. As you take these steps, pay attention to how they impact your thoughts and feelings about your future. Let's discuss how you can use the thought records to examine any negative thoughts that may arise during this process.\n\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense. I can use the thought records to identify any negative thoughts I have while exploring these career options and try to find evidence against them. Like if I think, \"I'll never be successful in a creative field,\" I can look for examples of people who have found success doing something similar.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Using thought records to challenge negative thoughts about your career exploration can help you maintain a more balanced and realistic perspective. It's also important to celebrate the small victories along the way, like taking a course or reaching out to someone in the field. These actions, no matter how small they may seem, are steps towards building a fulfilling career that aligns with your values. Remember to include these experiences in your activity schedule and track how they impact your mood.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I'll make sure to include these career exploration activities in my schedule and pay attention to how they make me feel. It might give me a sense of progress and purpose, even if it's just small steps.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Engaging in activities that align with your values and goals, even in small ways, can have a significant impact on your mood and overall sense of well-being. It's about building momentum and creating positive experiences that challenge the negative thoughts and beliefs you've been struggling with. As you continue this process, remember to practice the distress tolerance techniques we've discussed, like deep breathing and grounding exercises, to help manage any overwhelming emotions that may arise.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely keep practicing those techniques. They've been helpful when I start to feel really anxious or hopeless about the future. I'm still struggling with the thought records sometimes, though. I have trouble identifying the evidence against my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Jamie. Identifying evidence against negative thoughts can be difficult, especially when those thoughts feel so ingrained and automatic. One strategy is to imagine what you would say to a friend who expressed a similar thought. We're often more compassionate and objective when it comes to others. Another approach is to look for exceptions to the thought, even if they seem small or insignificant. For example, if you think, \"I'll never be successful in a creative field,\" you could consider any positive feedback you've received on your creative work, even if it's just from friends or family.\n\nPatient: That's helpful. I'll try to think about what I would say to a friend and look for those exceptions. It's just hard sometimes because the negative thoughts feel so true and overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging it can be to combat those negative thoughts, especially when they feel so powerful. Remember, the goal isn't to completely eliminate these thoughts but to develop a more balanced perspective. It's okay if the evidence against the thought doesn't feel as strong at first. With practice, it will become easier to challenge these thoughts and find alternative viewpoints. Let's practice with an example from your thought records this week. Can you share a thought you struggled to find evidence against?\n\nPatient: Sure. One thought I had a lot of trouble with was, \"I'm not good enough to pursue a creative career.\" I just couldn't think of any evidence against it.\n\nTherapist: That's a tough thought to challenge, but let's break it down together. What would you say to a friend who expressed that same thought? How would you support them in finding evidence against it?",
