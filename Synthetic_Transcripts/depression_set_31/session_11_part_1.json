  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our previous session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the thought records and incorporating meaningful activities into my daily routine. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood when I engage in activities I enjoy. However, I still struggle with feelings of guilt and shame related to productivity and self-worth.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on the thought records and behavioral activation. It's great that you've noticed some improvements in your mood, even if they're small. Change is often a gradual process, and every step counts. I understand that feelings of guilt and shame can be difficult to overcome. Let's make sure to address those feelings in today's session. How has your experience been with practicing open communication with Alex?\n\nPatient: It's been a bit easier to share my thoughts and feelings with Alex, but I still find myself holding back at times. I worry about burdening them with my struggles. Alex has been supportive and encourages me to open up, but it's a work in progress.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that you might worry about burdening Alex, but it's great that they've been supportive and encouraging. Building open communication in a relationship takes time and practice. Remember that your thoughts and feelings are valid, and sharing them with Alex can help strengthen your connection. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I'd like to focus on continuing to work on challenging my negative thoughts related to productivity and self-worth. I also want to discuss how I can be more consistent with incorporating meaningful activities into my daily routine. And maybe we could explore some of the underlying beliefs that might be contributing to my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Jamie. We can definitely work on challenging those negative thoughts and explore the underlying beliefs. Consistency with meaningful activities is also an important goal. Let's start by reviewing some of the thought records you've completed since our last session. Can you share an example of a thought record that you found particularly challenging or insightful?",
