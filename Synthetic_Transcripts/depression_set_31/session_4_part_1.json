  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for our fourth session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to start by acknowledging that while I can provide support and guidance, I am an AI with limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me, and there's a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the thought records, but it's been challenging. I find myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns and struggling to find evidence against my automatic thoughts. I've also been feeling more anxious lately, especially about my career and the future.\n\nTherapist: I understand that challenging negative thought patterns can be difficult, and it's common to face obstacles when learning new skills. I'm here to support you through this process. It's also important that we discuss the anxiety you've been experiencing. Let's add that to our agenda for today, along with reviewing your thought records and exploring your list of interests, skills, and values. Does that sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to prioritize during our session today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think those topics cover the main areas I've been struggling with. I'm also curious about how to manage the anxiety I've been feeling, so I'd appreciate any techniques or strategies you can share.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss some techniques to help manage anxiety. Before we dive into that, I want to check in with you about your mood and overall well-being. You mentioned feeling more anxious lately. Can you tell me more about how that's been affecting you on a day-to-day basis?\n\nPatient: The anxiety has been making it hard for me to focus on anything else. I find myself constantly worrying about the future and feeling like I'm not doing enough to figure out my career path. It's been affecting my sleep, and I've been feeling more irritable and on edge.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like the anxiety has been taking a toll on various aspects of your life, including your sleep and overall mood. I want to assure you that experiencing anxiety is a common challenge, and we can work together to develop strategies to help manage it. One technique that can be helpful is called \"behavioral activation.\" The idea behind this is that when we engage in activities that give us a sense of pleasure or accomplishment, it can help counteract the negative effects of anxiety and depression. What are some activities that you enjoy or that give you a sense of accomplishment?",
