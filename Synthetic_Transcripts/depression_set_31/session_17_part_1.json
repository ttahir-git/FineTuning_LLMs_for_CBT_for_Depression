  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted person in your life. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in any way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your support. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned, but it's been challenging. I've been feeling really low and struggling to find the motivation to do much of anything. I did try to track my mood and energy levels, but I haven't been consistent with it. I'm just feeling really stuck and hopeless right now.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Jamie. It's not uncommon to have ups and downs throughout the therapy process. I'm here to support you through these challenges. Let's take a closer look at what's been happening since our last session. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and feelings you've been experiencing when you try to work on the homework or engage in meaningful activities?\n\nPatient: Whenever I think about doing the homework or trying to do something meaningful, I just feel overwhelmed and exhausted. I think to myself, \"What's the point? It's not going to make a difference anyway.\" I feel like I'm just going through the motions, and nothing is really changing. It's hard to see a way out of this darkness.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you've been experiencing a lot of hopelessness and despair, which can make it incredibly difficult to take steps towards change. I want to acknowledge the strength and courage it takes to show up here today, even when you're feeling this way. The thought you mentioned, \"What's the point? It's not going to make a difference anyway,\" is a great place for us to start today. Would you be open to exploring this thought further and seeing if we can find a more balanced perspective?\n\nPatient: I guess so. I just don't know if it will help, but I'm willing to try.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for your willingness to explore this, Jamie. Before we dive in, let's set an agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it could be helpful to focus on:\n\n1. Exploring the thought \"What's the point? It's not going to make a difference anyway\" and seeing if we can find a more balanced perspective.\n2. Discussing your experience with tracking your mood and energy levels and see if we can problem-solve any challenges that have come up.\n3. Identifying one small, manageable meaningful activity you can commit to trying before our next session.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or focus on today?",
