  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share an example of a thought record I found challenging. A few days ago, I woke up feeling really low and didn't want to get out of bed. My automatic thought was, \"I'm useless and can't even get up to face the day.\" The emotions I felt were sadness and hopelessness, both at an intensity of about 8 out of 10.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. I can understand how that thought would be challenging to work with. Let's break it down using the thought record. What evidence did you find that supported the thought that you're useless?\n\nPatient: Well, I haven't been able to find a job for months, and I feel like I'm not contributing anything to society or my relationship with Alex. I just feel like a burden.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, and those feelings are valid. Now, let's look at the evidence against that thought. Have there been times when you've contributed to your relationship with Alex or engaged in activities that brought you a sense of accomplishment or joy?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been moments when I've been able to support Alex emotionally, and they've expressed appreciation for that. And when I do manage to work on a photography project or help out a friend, I feel a bit better about myself.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you've identified those moments of contribution and accomplishment. They serve as evidence against the thought that you're useless. Now, let's consider an alternative thought. Based on the evidence for and against, what might be a more balanced way of looking at the situation?\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought could be, \"Even though I struggle with depression and finding a job, I still have value as a person and can contribute in other ways, like supporting Alex and engaging in activities I enjoy.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought, Jamie. It acknowledges your struggles while also recognizing your inherent value and the different ways you can contribute. How intense are the emotions of sadness and hopelessness now, after considering this alternative perspective?\n\nPatient: They've definitely decreased. I'd say the sadness is now at a 5 out of 10, and the hopelessness is at a 4.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in intensity, Jamie. This thought record demonstrates how challenging negative thoughts and considering alternative perspectives can help shift our emotions. Let's continue practicing this skill with other thoughts you've had since our last session.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. I have another example from a couple of days ago when I was trying to work on a photography project but got frustrated and had the thought, \"I'll never be successful at anything I do.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to work with. Let's apply the same process to this thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you'll never be successful at anything?\n\nPatient: Well, I haven't been able to hold down a steady job, and my photography projects never seem to turn out the way I want them to. I feel like I'm constantly failing.\n\nTherapist: I understand how those experiences could lead to that thought. Now, let's look at the evidence against it. Have there been times when you've experienced success or received positive feedback on your photography or other endeavors?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been a few times when people have complimented my photography skills, and I've even had a couple of small exhibitions in local galleries. And in my previous jobs, I did receive some positive performance reviews.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you'll never be successful. It shows that you've had experiences of success and recognition in the past. Now, let's consider an alternative thought based on the evidence for and against.\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"While I've faced challenges and setbacks in my career and creative pursuits, I have also experienced moments of success and recognition. It's possible for me to find success in the future, even if it doesn't look exactly how I imagined.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful alternative thought, Jamie. It acknowledges the challenges you've faced while also recognizing the successes you've had and the potential for future success. How do you feel after considering this alternative perspective?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit more hopeful and less defeated. It reminds me that success isn't always a straight path and that setbacks don't define my entire future.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. This thought record demonstrates how challenging all-or-nothing thinking and considering a more nuanced perspective can help shift our emotions and outlook. Let's continue practicing this skill with other thoughts you've had since our last session.",
