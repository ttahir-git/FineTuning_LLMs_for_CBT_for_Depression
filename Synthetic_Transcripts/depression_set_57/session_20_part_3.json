  "transcript": "Patient: Thanks for helping me celebrate those victories, Nova. It feels good to acknowledge the progress I've made, even if it's small.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. Celebrating small victories is an important part of the process, and it's something you can continue to do on your own after our sessions end. Speaking of which, since this is our second-to-last session together, I want to start focusing on how you can maintain the progress you've made and continue using the skills you've learned independently. One way to do that is to create a personalized \"toolbox\" of CBT skills and strategies that you can refer back to when needed. What are some of the skills and strategies that you've found most helpful?\n\nPatient: I think the thought records have been really helpful for me in challenging negative thoughts and shifting my perspective. I've also found the mindfulness techniques, like deep breathing and focusing on the present moment, to be useful in managing my emotions and my chronic pain.\n\nTherapist: Those are great tools to have in your toolbox, Jamie. Thought records and mindfulness techniques are both really effective in managing negative thoughts and emotions. Another tool that can be helpful is coping cards, which are small cards with reminders of adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs. You can create coping cards for different situations or challenges and carry them with you to refer back to when needed. What are some adaptive thoughts or beliefs that you'd like to include on your coping cards?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to include reminders that feedback is part of the process and doesn't mean I'm not good enough, and that it's okay to take breaks and pace myself when I'm in pain. I'd also like to include some affirmations, like \"I am worthy of love and belonging\" and \"I am capable of managing my thoughts and emotions.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are all excellent reminders and affirmations, Jamie. Writing them down on coping cards can help solidify them in your mind and make them more accessible when you need them. Another important part of maintaining your progress is having a plan for how to handle potential setbacks or challenges. Let's call this your \"relapse prevention plan.\" What are some early warning signs that your depression might be starting to worsen?\n\nPatient: I think some early warning signs for me are isolating myself from others, having trouble sleeping or sleeping too much, and getting caught up in negative thoughts more often.\n\nTherapist: Those are really common warning signs, Jamie. Being able to recognize them early on is key in preventing a full-blown relapse. What are some strategies you can use when you notice those warning signs?\n\nPatient: I think I can try to reach out to my support system, like my sibling or my friends in the writing group, and let them know I'm struggling. I can also try to use my coping cards and thought records to challenge any negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Reaching out to your support system and using your coping strategies are both really important strategies, Jamie. It's also important to have a plan for how to access professional help if needed. Do you have a therapist or doctor that you can reach out to if your symptoms start to worsen?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I have a primary care doctor that I trust, and I know they can refer me to a therapist if needed. I also have the number for a local crisis hotline saved in my phone, in case I ever need it.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Jamie. Having those resources lined up ahead of time can make it easier to reach out for help if you need it. Remember, asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes a lot of courage to recognize when you need support and to reach out for it.",
