Celebrating the small steps and practicing problem-solving skills are key parts of building self-efficacy and maintaining your progress. As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling about everything we've discussed.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a little overwhelmed, but also hopeful. It's a lot to take in, but I can see how these strategies could really help me keep moving forward.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, Jamie. We've covered a lot of ground today. Remember, you don't have to implement everything at once. Start small and be patient with yourself. What's one small step you feel confident you can take this week to practice building your self-efficacy?\n\nPatient: I think I can start by noticing and celebrating one small success each day, even if it feels insignificant. Like, if I get out of bed at a regular time or reach out to a friend, I can give myself credit for that.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic small step, Jamie. Noticing and celebrating one success each day can make a big difference in how you feel about yourself and your progress. I'd also like to assign some homework related to the meta-thought records we discussed earlier. Would you be willing to try completing a meta-thought record on your own this week, maybe focused on a thought about your progress in therapy?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think I can do that. It'll be good practice for catching those negative thoughts about therapy and challenging them.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jamie. Practicing the meta-thought records can help you build confidence in your ability to challenge negative thoughts about the therapy process itself. Remember, it's okay if it feels challenging at first. The more you practice, the easier it will get.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll give it a try. Is there anything else I should focus on for homework this week?\n\nTherapist: I think continuing to practice the coping strategies we discussed as part of your relapse prevention plan would be really helpful. Maybe pick one or two strategies to focus on, like reviewing your thought records or reaching out for support when you need it.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can definitely do that.\n\nTherapist: Great, Jamie. I'm confident that practicing these skills will help you keep moving forward. Before we end today's session, I want to summarize what we've covered and make sure we're on the same page about the plan going forward.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Reviewing Jamie's progress with thought records and communication skills, introducing meta-thought records, developing a relapse prevention plan, building self-efficacy.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Thought records, communication skills practice, meta-thought records, problem-solving skills, celebrating small successes. In previous sessions, we have also used examining the evidence for and against negative thoughts, considering the costs and benefits of perfectionistic beliefs, loving-kindness meditation, and graded task assignments. We will continue to build on these techniques in future sessions, with a focus on applying them to specific challenges and situations in Jamie's life.\n- Homework assigned: Complete a meta-thought record focused on a thought about progress in therapy, practice one or two coping strategies from the relapse prevention plan (e.g., reviewing thought records, reaching out for support), notice and celebrate one small success each day.\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details: Jamie is making progress in recognizing and challenging negative thoughts related to their chronic pain and depression. They are starting to develop new coping skills, such as mindfulness and self-compassion, but continue to struggle with feelings of frustration, disappointment, and anxiety. Jamie's chronic pain remains a significant challenge that impacts their mood and motivation. They are also struggling with feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt related to their writing and have been avoiding sharing their struggles with their loved ones due to fear of being a burden.\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs: In this session, we identified a core belief: \"I'm fundamentally unlovable and a burden to anyone who gets close to me.\" We also discussed intermediate beliefs related to being powerless and unable to achieve goals due to chronic pain. We started to challenge these beliefs and develop new, more helpful beliefs.\n- Important information to carry forward: Jamie's specific goals and treatment plan, their struggles with chronic pain and its impact on their mood and motivation, and their commitment to completing homework and reporting back on progress. Jamie's support system, including their trusted friend in the writing group and their sibling.\n- Plan for the next session: Review Jamie's progress with homework (meta-thought record, coping strategies practice, celebrating small successes), continue building skills in thought records, mindfulness, and cognitive restructuring, and explore any challenges or successes Jamie has had in implementing their relapse prevention plan.\n\nTherapist: How are you feeling about that summary, Jamie? Does it capture the main points from today's session?\n\nPatient: Yeah, that summary covers everything really well. It's helpful to have it all laid out like that.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad it's helpful, Jamie. Having a clear summary can make it easier to remember what we've discussed and stay focused on your goals. Before we end, I want to check in on how you're feeling emotionally. What's your mood like now, compared to the beginning of the session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful than I was at the beginning. I'm still a little overwhelmed, but I feel like I have some clear steps I can take to keep moving forward.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful, Jamie. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, too. Remember, you don't have to do everything at once. Start small and be patient with yourself. If you find yourself getting stuck or needing extra support, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the reminder to be patient with myself. I'll do my best to keep practicing these skills and reach out if I need help.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. I'm confident that with continued practice and support, you'll keep making progress towards your goals. I look forward to hearing about your successes and challenges in our next session. Until then, take care of yourself and remember to celebrate those small steps along the way.",
