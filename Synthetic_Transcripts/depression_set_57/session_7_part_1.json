  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 7. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also want to remind you that since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm committed to working with you and providing the best support I can within my capabilities. How have you been since our last session? I'd love to hear about any changes, challenges, or successes you've experienced.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the sleep hygiene techniques we discussed, like establishing a consistent sleep schedule and bedtime routine. It's been challenging, but I have noticed some improvement in my sleep quality. I've also been working on completing thought records, especially when I notice negative thoughts about my worth or abilities creeping in.\n\nHowever, I've been struggling with reaching out to my support system. I know it's important, but I often find myself making excuses not to connect with others. I'm not sure why I keep avoiding it, even though I know it would be helpful.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been implementing the sleep hygiene techniques and noticing some improvement in your sleep quality. Consistency is key, and it's normal to face challenges along the way. I'm also glad to hear that you've been using thought records to address negative thoughts about your worth and abilities. This is an important step in recognizing and challenging these thoughts.\n\nRegarding reaching out to your support system, avoidance is a common challenge for many people dealing with depression. It's helpful that you've identified this pattern. We can explore this further and work on strategies to help you connect with others more easily. Would you like to add this to our agenda for today's session?\n\nPat",
