  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that triggered negative thoughts was when I tried to go for a walk in the park, but my chronic pain flared up, and I had to turn back home. I felt like a failure and thought, \"I'll never be able to do the things I used to enjoy.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. That's a great example of how a specific situation can trigger negative thoughts. The thought \"I'll never be able to do the things I used to enjoy\" is a good one for us to explore further. This type of thinking is called a cognitive distortion, which is essentially an inaccurate or exaggerated thought pattern that can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety.\n\nOne common cognitive distortion is called \"all-or-nothing thinking\" or \"black-and-white thinking.\" This is when we see things in extreme, absolute terms, like \"never\" or \"always.\" In your case, the thought \"I'll never be able to do the things I used to enjoy\" is an example of all-or-nothing thinking. While your chronic pain may limit some activities, it doesn't necessarily mean you'll never be able to enjoy any of the things you used to do.\n\nAnother cognitive distortion that might be at play here is \"overgeneralization.\" This is when we take one negative experience and assume that it will always happen in the future. For example, just because you had to cut your walk short due to pain this time doesn't mean that you'll never be able to go for a walk again.\n\nDoes this make sense, Jamie? Can you think of any other examples of cognitive distortions in your thought record?",
