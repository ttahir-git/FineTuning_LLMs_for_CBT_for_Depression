  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for our third session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm feeling a bit low today, but I'm hoping our session will help me gain some clarity and motivation.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're here, and I'm committed to working with you to improve your well-being. Before we start, let's set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review your homework from the previous session, finalize our conceptualization of your depression, and begin setting specific, measurable goals for your therapy. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm curious to see how my homework fits into the bigger picture.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your thought record and the cognitive distortions you identified. Can you share some examples of negative thoughts you noticed and the distortions present in them?",
