  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some really important points, Jamie. Recognizing the progress you've made and the tools you have to maintain that progress is key as we wrap up our sessions together. I want to acknowledge the hard work you've put in and the courage you've shown in facing your challenges head-on. Before we end today, let's take a moment to check in on how you're feeling now and if there's anything else you'd like to discuss.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a lot better than when we started today. It's been helpful to review the skills I've learned and make a plan for how to keep using them. I do have one last question, though. What if I start to feel really overwhelmed or like I'm not making progress? How do I know if I need to come back to therapy?\n\nTherapist: That's a really important question, Jamie. It's normal to have ups and downs, even after therapy ends. If you start to feel overwhelmed or like you're not making progress, the first step is to use the skills and tools we've discussed, like your thought records, coping cards, and relapse prevention plan. If you find that you're still struggling after trying those strategies, it might be a good idea to reach out for additional support. That could mean coming back to therapy for a few \"booster\" sessions, joining a support group, or talking to your doctor. The most important thing is to be honest with yourself about how you're doing and not be afraid to ask for help if you need it.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just worry that needing more help means I've failed somehow.\n\nTherapist: I understand that worry, Jamie. But needing more help doesn't mean you've failed at all. It means you're human and you're facing challenges, just like everyone else. Asking for help when you need it is a sign of strength and self-awareness, not weakness. And even if you do come back to therapy, that doesn't erase all the progress you've made. You'll still have all the skills and insights you've gained, and you'll be starting from a different place than when we first began.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I guess I just need to keep reminding myself that progress isn't always linear and that it's okay to need help sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. And you have the tools to help yourself now, even if it doesn't always feel that way. Remember, you've made so much progress already, and that progress is yours to keep, no matter what happens next. I have a lot of faith in you and your ability to keep moving forward.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate all your support and guidance. I feel like I've learned a lot and I'm ready to keep using these skills on my own.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Jamie. It's been a pleasure working with you and seeing all the progress you've made. Before we end, let's assign some homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing your thought records and mindfulness techniques, and to start creating your coping cards. You can also start thinking about how you'll use your relapse prevention plan if needed. We'll review all of that at our final session next week.\n\nPatient: Sounds good. I'll keep practicing and start working on those coping cards. Thanks again for everything.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. I look forward to our final session next week. Take care until then.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Managing conflicts in relationships, handling feedback, celebrating small victories, creating a \"toolbox\" of CBT skills, developing a relapse prevention plan, discussing options for ongoing support after therapy ends.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Thought records, mindfulness techniques, coping cards, relapse prevention planning, problem-solving future challenges.
