  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's work on developing some coping statements that you can use when you're feeling overwhelmed by pain and negative thoughts. Coping statements are short, positive phrases that can help you challenge negative thoughts and refocus your attention on more helpful perspectives. For example, you could try saying to yourself, \"I've managed my pain before, and I can do it again\" or \"I am doing the best I can, and that's enough.\"\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's simple, but I can see how it could be effective in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. The key is to practice these statements regularly, even when you're not in a crisis, so that they become more automatic. You can write them down on index cards or in your phone, and review them daily. Over time, they can help shift your overall thinking patterns.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely give that a try. It's nice to have a tool I can use in the moment when things feel overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find it helpful. Remember, managing chronic pain and depression is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Let's also discuss how you can continue to use thought records to address negative thoughts related to your pain and its impact on your life.\n\nPatient: I think I need to practice recognizing when I'm having those negative thoughts in the first place. Sometimes they just feel like facts, you know?\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Negative thoughts can often feel very convincing, especially when we're dealing with chronic pain and depression. One way to start recognizing them is to look for common cognitive distortions, like all-or-nothing thinking or overgeneralization.\n\nPatient: Can you give me an example of how that might show up for me?\n\nTherapist: Sure. Let's say you have a day where your pain is particularly bad, and you think to yourself, \"I'll never be able to do the things I love again.\" That thought might be an example of overgeneralization, where you take one difficult day and assume it means your entire future will be the same. Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can definitely see myself falling into that trap. It's like I get stuck in this negative spiral.\n\nTherapist: That's very common. By identifying those cognitive distortions, you can start to challenge them using thought records. For example, you could look for evidence against the thought that you'll never be able to do the things you love again. Maybe there are times when your pain is more manageable, or you've found adaptations that allow you to still engage in activities you enjoy.\n\nPatient: I guess that's true. There are some days when I'm able to do more, even if it's not exactly the same as before.\n\nTherapist: That's an important insight. It shows that there's more to the story than that initial negative thought. As you continue to practice thought records, you'll likely find it easier to recognize and challenge those cognitive distortions.",
