  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's dive into the meta-thought record. Can you identify a thought you've had about the therapy process itself that we could explore together?\n\nPatient: Sure, one thought that comes to mind is \"I'm not making progress fast enough in therapy.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, great. And what emotion do you notice alongside that thought?\n\nPatient: I feel frustrated and discouraged when I have that thought.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense. Those emotions are important to acknowledge. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you see that supports the idea that you're not making progress fast enough?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the fact that I'm still struggling with depression symptoms, and I still have days where I feel really low and hopeless. And I'm not back to writing as much as I was before my pain got worse.\n\nTherapist: That's valid evidence. It's true that you're still facing challenges, and it's understandable to want to see more progress. Now, what about evidence against the thought? What evidence do you have that you are making progress, even if it doesn't feel fast enough?\n\nPatient: Hmm, well, I have been doing the homework consistently, and I've had some good conversations with my loved ones where I felt supported and understood. And I have been able to keep writing, even if it's not as much as before.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Those are clear pieces of evidence that you are making progress. Consistency with homework, successful conversations with loved ones, and continuing to write despite the challenges are all significant steps forward. What might be a more balanced thought based on the evidence for and against?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like \"I am making progress in therapy, even though it's not always as fast as I'd like. The small steps I'm taking are adding up over time.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great balanced thought, Jamie. It acknowledges the progress you've made while also validating the frustration of wanting to move faster. How does that thought feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It feels more hopeful and encouraging. Like, I can see that I am moving forward, even if it's slow sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Jamie. Being able to recognize and celebrate the small steps is so important. And the more we practice these meta-thought records, the easier it will get to challenge those discouraging thoughts about the therapy process.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see how this could be really helpful, especially on the days when I'm feeling down about my progress.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And as we keep practicing, it will get easier to catch those thoughts and challenge them in the moment. Speaking of progress, I want to spend some time today starting to develop a relapse prevention plan. This is a plan to help you maintain your progress after our sessions end and manage any potential setbacks. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds really important. I want to make sure I have the tools to keep moving forward, even after we stop meeting regularly.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad you're thinking ahead about maintaining your progress, Jamie. A relapse prevention plan can be really helpful for that. One key part of the plan is identifying early warning signs that your depression symptoms might be starting to worsen again. What do you think some of your early warning signs might be?\n\nPatient: Hmm, I think one early warning sign for me is when I start isolating myself more and avoiding reaching out to people. That's usually a sign that my depression is getting worse.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Avoidance and isolation can definitely be early warning signs of depression. What are some other signs you've noticed?\n\nPatient: Another sign is when I start having more negative thoughts about myself and my future. Like, if I start thinking \"I'll never get better\" or \"I'm not good enough,\" that's usually a red flag.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Noticing an increase in negative thoughts, especially hopeless thoughts about the future, can be a clear early warning sign. What about changes in your behavior or daily routines? What might be some signs there?\n\nPatient: If I start skipping my self-care routines, like not taking my medication consistently or not getting out of bed at a regular time, that's usually a sign that I'm struggling more. And if I stop writing altogether, that's a big red flag.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important signs to pay attention to, Jamie. Changes in self-care routines and losing interest in activities you usually enjoy can be clear indicators that your depression is worsening. The good news is, by being aware of these early warning signs, you can catch them sooner and take action to prevent a full relapse.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. So what kind of action should I take if I notice these warning signs?\n\nTherapist: Great question. That's the next part of the relapse prevention plan - identifying coping strategies you can use when you notice early warning signs. One strategy is to review the skills and techniques we've practiced in therapy, like thought records, behavioral activation, and communication skills. Reminding yourself of the tools you have can be really empowering.\n\nPatient: Yeah, that's a good point. I can look back at the thought records I've done and remind myself of the evidence against my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Another strategy is to reach out for support, whether that's to a trusted loved one, a support group, or a mental health professional. Connecting with others can help challenge the isolation and remind you that you're not alone.\n\nPatient: That's definitely something I need to work on - reaching out for help when I need it. I tend to isolate myself when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Reaching out for support can be challenging, but it's a crucial part of preventing relapse. We can practice that skill more in our remaining sessions. Another strategy is to focus on self-care, even if you don't feel motivated. Things like taking your medication consistently, getting out of bed at a regular time, and engaging in small activities can make a big difference.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I know self-care is important, but it's hard to prioritize it when I'm feeling down. I guess that's where the behavioral activation comes in, right?\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. Using behavioral activation to schedule small, manageable activities can help you maintain your self-care routines, even when your motivation is low. And the more you practice these coping strategies when you notice early warning signs, the more automatic they'll become.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's kind of like building a toolbox of strategies I can use when I need them.\n\nTherapist: That's a great analogy, Jamie. We're building a toolbox of skills and strategies that you can use to maintain your progress and prevent relapse. And the more you practice using those tools, the more confident you'll feel in your ability to handle challenges as they come up.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It feels empowering to know that I have tools I can use, even after therapy ends.\n\nTherapist: It is empowering, Jamie. And that's a great segue into another important part of relapse prevention - building self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is the belief that you have the skills and abilities to navigate challenges and achieve your goals. How would you rate your self-efficacy right now, in terms of managing your depression?\n\nPatient: Hmm, I would say my self-efficacy is still pretty low. I know I've made progress, but I still have a lot of doubts about my ability to keep it up long-term.\n\nTherapist: That's a common feeling, Jamie. Building self-efficacy takes time and practice. One way to build self-efficacy is to look back at the progress you've already made and give yourself credit for the hard work you've put in. What are some examples of progress you've made that you feel proud of?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm proud of myself for being consistent with therapy and doing the homework, even when it's been hard. And I'm proud of the times when I've reached out for support, like with my sibling and my friend from the writing group.\n\nTherapist: Those are huge accomplishments, Jamie. Consistency with therapy and homework takes a lot of effort, and reaching out for support can be really challenging. Recognizing and celebrating those successes can help build your confidence in your ability to keep making progress.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess I don't always give myself credit for the small steps. I tend to focus on the things I'm not doing well.\n\nTherapist: That's a common tendency, Jamie. Our brains are wired to pay more attention to the negative than the positive. But the more we practice noticing and celebrating the small steps, the more we train our brains to see the progress we're making. Another way to build self-efficacy is to practice problem-solving skills for challenges that come up.\n\nPatient: What do you mean by problem-solving skills?\n\nTherapist: Problem-solving skills involve breaking down a challenge into smaller, more manageable steps and brainstorming potential solutions. For example, let's say you notice that your depression symptoms are starting to worsen. What might be some small steps you could take to address that challenge?\n\nPatient: Hmm, I guess one small step could be reviewing my thought records and reminding myself of the evidence against my negative thoughts. Another step could be reaching out to a trusted loved one for support.\n\nTherapist: Those are great small steps, Jamie. And what might be some potential solutions if those steps don't seem to be enough?\n\nPatient: If those steps aren't enough, I could try increasing my self-care routines, like making sure I'm taking my medication consistently and getting out of bed at a regular time. And if I'm still struggling, I could consider reaching out to a mental health professional for additional support.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent solutions, Jamie. And the more you practice breaking down challenges and brainstorming solutions, the more confident you'll feel in your ability to handle whatever comes up. How are you feeling about your self-efficacy now, after discussing these strategies?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a little more hopeful. It's good to know that I have specific steps I can take when I'm facing a challenge. And I can see how practicing these skills could help me feel more confident over time.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Jamie. Building self-efficacy is an ongoing process, but the fact that you're already feeling more hopeful is a great sign. And the more you practice these skills, the more automatic they'll become.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess it's kind of like building a muscle. The more I use it, the stronger it gets.\n\nTherapist: That's a great analogy, Jamie. Building self-efficacy is a lot like building a muscle. It takes time and consistent practice, but the more you work at it, the stronger it gets. And just like with physical exercise, it's okay to start small and gradually increase the difficulty as you get more comfortable.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I don't have to tackle everything at once. I can start with small challenges and work my way up.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. Starting small and gradually increasing the difficulty is a great way to build confidence and avoid overwhelm. And celebrating each small success along the way can help keep you motivated and engaged in the process.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think celebrating the small successes is something I need to work on. I tend to dismiss them and focus on the bigger goals.\n\nTherapist: That's a common tendency, Jamie. But the small successes are what add up to the bigger goals over time. And the more you practice noticing and celebrating them, the easier it will get to see your progress and believe in your ability to keep moving forward.\n\nPatient: That makes a lot of sense. I guess I need to start giving myself more credit for the small steps.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jamie. Giving yourself credit for the small steps is a crucial part of building self-efficacy and maintaining your progress. And the more you practice, the more automatic it will become.",
