  "transcript": "Patient: Hi, I'm back for session 18. Here is the summary you provided me at the end of our last session:\n\n- Main topics discussed: Reviewing Jamie's progress with thought records, exploring the impact of Jamie's feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt on their writing and self-esteem, discussing how Jamie's chronic pain has been affecting their relationship with their sibling, introducing the downward arrow technique to uncover intermediate and core beliefs, planning a behavioral experiment for Jamie to reach out to a friend for support, practicing communication skills to express needs and emotions more effectively.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Thought records, downward arrow technique, behavioral experiments, communication skills role-play. In previous sessions, we have also used examining the evidence for and against negative thoughts, considering the costs and benefits of perfectionistic beliefs, loving-kindness meditation, and graded task assignments. We will continue to build on these techniques in future sessions, with a focus on applying them to specific challenges and situations in Jamie's life.\n- Homework assigned: Continue practicing thought records (at least one per day), collect evidence for new core belief that Jamie is good enough and can succeed, practice communication skills by having at least one conversation with sibling or loved one expressing needs and emotions directly, continue implementing pain management plan and tracking progress (noting changes in pain or mood and any challenges encountered).\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details: Jamie is making progress in recognizing and challenging negative thoughts related to their chronic pain and depression. They are starting to develop new coping skills, such as mindfulness and self-compassion, but continue to struggle with feelings of frustration, disappointment, and anxiety. Jamie's chronic pain remains a significant challenge that impacts their mood and motivation. They are also struggling with feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt related to their writing and have been avoiding sharing their struggles with their loved ones due to fear of being a burden.\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs: In this session, we identified a core belief: \"I'm fundamentally unlovable and a burden to anyone who gets close to me.\" We also discussed intermediate beliefs related to being powerless and unable to achieve goals due to chronic pain. We started to challenge these beliefs and develop new, more helpful beliefs.\n- Important information to carry forward: Jamie's specific goals and treatment plan, their struggles with chronic pain and its impact on their mood and motivation, and their commitment to completing homework and reporting back on progress. Jamie's support system, including their trusted friend in the writing group and their sibling.\n- Plan for the next session: Review Jamie's progress with homework (thought records, collecting evidence for new core belief, communication skills practice, pain management plan), continue building skills in thought records, mindfulness, and cognitive restructuring, and explore the results of Jamie's behavioral experiment with reaching out to their friend and practicing communication skills with their sibling.\n\nTherapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for providing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about that. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the thought records and communication skills we discussed, but it's been challenging at times. My chronic pain has been flaring up more frequently, which makes it harder to focus on anything else.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you've been practicing the skills we've worked on, even though it's been difficult. It's understandable that your chronic pain has been making it harder to focus on other things. How has your mood been in general, and have there been any changes in your depression symptoms?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. Some days I feel more hopeful and motivated, but other days I feel really low and struggle to get out of bed. I've noticed that my sleep has been more disrupted lately, which probably isn't helping. I'm still having trouble with feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt, especially when it comes to my writing.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you've been experiencing some fluctuations in your mood, which can be challenging to navigate. Disrupted sleep can certainly have an impact on your overall well-being and mood. I'm glad you're aware of the connection between your sleep and your depression symptoms. Regarding your writing, have you been able to practice the behavioral experiment we discussed, reaching out to a friend for support?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I did reach out to my friend from the writing group. It was scary to be vulnerable like that, but they were really supportive and understanding. We had a good conversation about the challenges of writing and dealing with self-doubt. It felt good to connect with someone who gets it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great step forward, Jamie. It takes courage to reach out and be vulnerable, and I'm glad to hear that your friend was supportive. Connecting with others who understand your experiences can be incredibly validating and helpful. How did that experience impact your thoughts and feelings about your writing and yourself?\n\nPatient: It definitely helped to hear that I'm not alone in struggling with self-doubt and feeling like an imposter sometimes. My friend shared some of their own experiences, and it made me realize that even successful writers deal with these feelings. It didn't completely get rid of my self-doubt, but it did make me feel a bit more hopeful and less alone.\n\nTherapist: That's a valuable insight, Jamie. Recognizing that even successful writers face self-doubt can help normalize your own experiences and challenge the belief that you're not good enough. It's great that you're able to see the benefits of connecting with others, even if it doesn't eliminate your self-doubt completely. How have you been doing with the other homework assignments, like practicing communication skills with your sibling?\n\nPatient: I had a conversation with my sibling about how my chronic pain has been affecting me and our relationship. It was hard to open up about that, but they were really understanding and supportive. We talked about ways we can stay connected even when I'm having a bad pain day. It felt good to express my needs and have them validated.\n\nTherapist: I'm really proud of you for having that conversation with your sibling, Jamie. It's not easy to open up about something so personal and vulnerable, but it's clear that it had a positive impact on your relationship. Being able to express your needs and have them validated is so important. How did that experience affect your thoughts and beliefs about being a burden to others?\n\nPatient: It definitely challenged that belief. My sibling made it clear that they want to support me and be there for me, even when I'm struggling. It made me realize that maybe I'm not as much of a burden as I thought. It's still hard to shake that belief completely, but it's a start.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant realization, Jamie. Challenging long-held beliefs takes time and practice, but recognizing that your loved ones want to support you is a big step in the right direction. As we continue to work together, we can keep building on these experiences and insights.\n\nFor today's agenda, I'd like to focus on a few key areas. First, I'd like to review your progress with the homework assignments in more detail and discuss any challenges or successes you've had. Second, I'd like to introduce a new technique called meta-thought records, which can help us explore your thoughts and beliefs about the therapy process itself. And third, I'd like to start developing a relapse prevention plan to help you maintain your progress after our sessions end. How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: The agenda sounds good to me. I'm especially interested in learning about the meta-thought records and developing a relapse prevention plan. I want to make sure I have the tools to keep making progress after our sessions end.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Jamie, and it's wonderful that you're thinking ahead about maintaining your progress. Before we dive into those topics, let's review your homework in more detail. You mentioned that you've been practicing the thought records and communication skills we discussed. Can you tell me more about how that's been going?\n\nPatient: Well, with the thought records, I've been trying to do at least one per day like we talked about. Some days it's easier than others. When my pain is really bad, it's hard to focus on anything else, let alone challenge my thoughts. But I have noticed that when I do the thought records, it helps me see things from a different perspective.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been consistent with the thought records, even though it's been challenging at times. Recognizing that it's harder to do when your pain is severe is an important insight. What about the communication skills practice? How has that been going?\n\nPatient: The conversation with my sibling went well, like I mentioned earlier. I've also been trying to be more open with my friend from the writing group. It's still scary to be vulnerable, but it's getting a little easier each time. I'm starting to see that people do want to support me, even when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant realization, Jamie. Challenging that belief about being a burden is a big step forward. It takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable and open up to others, and it's great that you're seeing the benefits of doing so. Have there been any other challenges or successes with the homework that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: One challenge I've had is with collecting evidence for the new core belief that I'm good enough and can succeed. Sometimes it feels like the evidence for the old belief is so much stronger, you know? Like, I see all the ways I'm not measuring up, and it's hard to focus on the positives.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge when trying to shift core beliefs, Jamie. Our brains are wired to pay more attention to negative information, so it can feel like the evidence for the old belief is stronger. But the fact that you're noticing the positives, even if they feel small, is a big deal. Every piece of evidence for the new belief is a step in the right direction. What's one piece of evidence you've collected so far?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess one piece of evidence is that I've been able to keep writing, even though it's been hard. I haven't given up, even on the days when I feel like I'm not good enough. That takes perseverance, which is a strength of mine.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jamie. Perseverance is a huge strength, and the fact that you've been able to keep writing despite the challenges is a clear piece of evidence that you're good enough and can succeed. It's okay if the evidence feels small at first \u2013 every bit counts. As we keep collecting evidence, it will get easier to see the new belief as true.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just need to keep practicing and reminding myself of the evidence I've collected so far.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. And that's where the meta-thought records can come in handy. Meta-thought records are a way to explore your thoughts and beliefs about the therapy process itself. For example, you might have a thought like, \"I'm not making enough progress in therapy,\" or \"I should be further along by now.\" Those thoughts can be discouraging and make it harder to keep going. With meta-thought records, we can challenge those thoughts and look at the evidence for your progress in a more balanced way.\n\nPatient: That sounds really helpful. Can you give me an example of how to do a meta-thought record?\n\nTherapist: Sure, Jamie. Let's say you have the thought, \"I'm not making enough progress in therapy.\" First, we would identify the emotion that goes with that thought \u2013 maybe it's discouragement or frustration. Then, we would look at the evidence for and against that thought. Evidence for the thought might be that you're still struggling with depression symptoms, or that you haven't met all your goals yet. Evidence against the thought might be that you've been consistent with the homework, you've had some successful conversations with your loved ones, and you've been able to keep writing despite the challenges. Then, we would come up with a more balanced thought based on the evidence, like \"I'm making progress in therapy, even though I still have challenges to work on.\" How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That makes a lot of sense. It's kind of like taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture, instead of getting stuck in the negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. Meta-thought records can help us take a more balanced perspective on the therapy process and recognize the progress we've made, even when it feels like we're not moving fast enough. Would you like to try doing a meta-thought record together now?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that would be really helpful. Let's do it.\n\nTherapist: Let's dive into the meta-thought record. Can you identify a thought you've had about the therapy process itself that we could explore together?\n\nPatient: Sure, one thought that comes to mind is \"I'm not making progress fast enough in therapy.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, great. And what emotion do you notice alongside that thought?\n\nPatient: I feel frustrated and discouraged when I have that thought.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense. Those emotions are important to acknowledge. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you see that supports the idea that you're not making progress fast enough?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the fact that I'm still struggling with depression symptoms, and I still have days where I feel really low and hopeless. And I'm not back to writing as much as I was before my pain got worse.\n\nTherapist: That's valid evidence. It's true that you're still facing challenges, and it's understandable to want to see more progress. Now, what about evidence against the thought? What evidence do you have that you are making progress, even if it doesn't feel fast enough?\n\nPatient: Hmm, well, I have been doing the homework consistently, and I've had some good conversations with my loved ones where I felt supported and understood. And I have been able to keep writing, even if it's not as much as before.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Those are clear pieces of evidence that you are making progress. Consistency with homework, successful conversations with loved ones, and continuing to write despite the challenges are all significant steps forward. What might be a more balanced thought based on the evidence for and against?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like \"I am making progress in therapy, even though it's not always as fast as I'd like. The small steps I'm taking are adding up over time.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great balanced thought, Jamie. It acknowledges the progress you've made while also validating the frustration of wanting to move faster. How does that thought feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It feels more hopeful and encouraging. Like, I can see that I am moving forward, even if it's slow sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Jamie. Being able to recognize and celebrate the small steps is so important. And the more we practice these meta-thought records, the easier it will get to challenge those discouraging thoughts about the therapy process.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see how this could be really helpful, especially on the days when I'm feeling down about my progress.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And as we keep practicing, it will get easier to catch those thoughts and challenge them in the moment. Speaking of progress, I want to spend some time today starting to develop a relapse prevention plan. This is a plan to help you maintain your progress after our sessions end and manage any potential setbacks. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds really important. I want to make sure I have the tools to keep moving forward, even after we stop meeting regularly.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad you're thinking ahead about maintaining your progress, Jamie. A relapse prevention plan can be really helpful for that. One key part of the plan is identifying early warning signs that your depression symptoms might be starting to worsen again. What do you think some of your early warning signs might be?\n\nPatient: Hmm, I think one early warning sign for me is when I start isolating myself more and avoiding reaching out to people. That's usually a sign that my depression is getting worse.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Avoidance and isolation can definitely be early warning signs of depression. What are some other signs you've noticed?\n\nPatient: Another sign is when I start having more negative thoughts about myself and my future. Like, if I start thinking \"I'll never get better\" or \"I'm not good enough,\" that's usually a red flag.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Noticing an increase in negative thoughts, especially hopeless thoughts about the future, can be a clear early warning sign. What about changes in your behavior or daily routines? What might be some signs there?\n\nPatient: If I start skipping my self-care routines, like not taking my medication consistently or not getting out of bed at a regular time, that's usually a sign that I'm struggling more. And if I stop writing altogether, that's a big red flag.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important signs to pay attention to, Jamie. Changes in self-care routines and losing interest in activities you usually enjoy can be clear indicators that your depression is worsening. The good news is, by being aware of these early warning signs, you can catch them sooner and take action to prevent a full relapse.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. So what kind of action should I take if I notice these warning signs?\n\nTherapist: Great question. That's the next part of the relapse prevention plan - identifying coping strategies you can use when you notice early warning signs. One strategy is to review the skills and techniques we've practiced in therapy, like thought records, behavioral activation, and communication skills. Reminding yourself of the tools you have can be really empowering.\n\nPatient: Yeah, that's a good point. I can look back at the thought records I've done and remind myself of the evidence against my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Another strategy is to reach out for support, whether that's to a trusted loved one, a support group, or a mental health professional. Connecting with others can help challenge the isolation and remind you that you're not alone.\n\nPatient: That's definitely something I need to work on - reaching out for help when I need it. I tend to isolate myself when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Reaching out for support can be challenging, but it's a crucial part of preventing relapse. We can practice that skill more in our remaining sessions. Another strategy is to focus on self-care, even if you don't feel motivated. Things like taking your medication consistently, getting out of bed at a regular time, and engaging in small activities can make a big difference.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I know self-care is important, but it's hard to prioritize it when I'm feeling down. I guess that's where the behavioral activation comes in, right?\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. Using behavioral activation to schedule small, manageable activities can help you maintain your self-care routines, even when your motivation is low. And the more you practice these coping strategies when you notice early warning signs, the more automatic they'll become.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's kind of like building a toolbox of strategies I can use when I need them.\n\nTherapist: That's a great analogy, Jamie. We're building a toolbox of skills and strategies that you can use to maintain your progress and prevent relapse. And the more you practice using those tools, the more confident you'll feel in your ability to handle challenges as they come up.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It feels empowering to know that I have tools I can use, even after therapy ends.\n\nTherapist: It is empowering, Jamie. And that's a great segue into another important part of relapse prevention - building self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is the belief that you have the skills and abilities to navigate challenges and achieve your goals. How would you rate your self-efficacy right now, in terms of managing your depression?\n\nPatient: Hmm, I would say my self-efficacy is still pretty low. I know I've made progress, but I still have a lot of doubts about my ability to keep it up long-term.\n\nTherapist: That's a common feeling, Jamie. Building self-efficacy takes time and practice. One way to build self-efficacy is to look back at the progress you've already made and give yourself credit for the hard work you've put in. What are some examples of progress you've made that you feel proud of?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm proud of myself for being consistent with therapy and doing the homework, even when it's been hard. And I'm proud of the times when I've reached out for support, like with my sibling and my friend from the writing group.\n\nTherapist: Those are huge accomplishments, Jamie. Consistency with therapy and homework takes a lot of effort, and reaching out for support can be really challenging. Recognizing and celebrating those successes can help build your confidence in your ability to keep making progress.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess I don't always give myself credit for the small steps. I tend to focus on the things I'm not doing well.\n\nTherapist: That's a common tendency, Jamie. Our brains are wired to pay more attention to the negative than the positive. But the more we practice noticing and celebrating the small steps, the more we train our brains to see the progress we're making. Another way to build self-efficacy is to practice problem-solving skills for challenges that come up.\n\nPatient: What do you mean by problem-solving skills?\n\nTherapist: Problem-solving skills involve breaking down a challenge into smaller, more manageable steps and brainstorming potential solutions. For example, let's say you notice that your depression symptoms are starting to worsen. What might be some small steps you could take to address that challenge?\n\nPatient: Hmm, I guess one small step could be reviewing my thought records and reminding myself of the evidence against my negative thoughts. Another step could be reaching out to a trusted loved one for support.\n\nTherapist: Those are great small steps, Jamie. And what might be some potential solutions if those steps don't seem to be enough?\n\nPatient: If those steps aren't enough, I could try increasing my self-care routines, like making sure I'm taking my medication consistently and getting out of bed at a regular time. And if I'm still struggling, I could consider reaching out to a mental health professional for additional support.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent solutions, Jamie. And the more you practice breaking down challenges and brainstorming solutions, the more confident you'll feel in your ability to handle whatever comes up. How are you feeling about your self-efficacy now, after discussing these strategies?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a little more hopeful. It's good to know that I have specific steps I can take when I'm facing a challenge. And I can see how practicing these skills could help me feel more confident over time.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Jamie. Building self-efficacy is an ongoing process, but the fact that you're already feeling more hopeful is a great sign. And the more you practice these skills, the more automatic they'll become.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess it's kind of like building a muscle. The more I use it, the stronger it gets.\n\nTherapist: That's a great analogy, Jamie. Building self-efficacy is a lot like building a muscle. It takes time and consistent practice, but the more you work at it, the stronger it gets. And just like with physical exercise, it's okay to start small and gradually increase the difficulty as you get more comfortable.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I don't have to tackle everything at once. I can start with small challenges and work my way up.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. Starting small and gradually increasing the difficulty is a great way to build confidence and avoid overwhelm. And celebrating each small success along the way can help keep you motivated and engaged in the process.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think celebrating the small successes is something I need to work on. I tend to dismiss them and focus on the bigger goals.\n\nTherapist: That's a common tendency, Jamie. But the small successes are what add up to the bigger goals over time. And the more you practice noticing and celebrating them, the easier it will get to see your progress and believe in your ability to keep moving forward.\n\nPatient: That makes a lot of sense. I guess I need to start giving myself more credit for the small steps.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jamie. Giving yourself credit for the small steps is a crucial part of building self-efficacy and maintaining your progress. And the more you practice, the more automatic it will become.\n\nTherapist: You've made some great points, Jamie. Celebrating the small steps and practicing problem-solving skills are key parts of building self-efficacy and maintaining your progress. As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling about everything we've discussed.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a little overwhelmed, but also hopeful. It's a lot to take in, but I can see how these strategies could really help me keep moving forward.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, Jamie. We've covered a lot of ground today. Remember, you don't have to implement everything at once. Start small and be patient with yourself. What's one small step you feel confident you can take this week to practice building your self-efficacy?\n\nPatient: I think I can start by noticing and celebrating one small success each day, even if it feels insignificant. Like, if I get out of bed at a regular time or reach out to a friend, I can give myself credit for that.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic small step, Jamie. Noticing and celebrating one success each day can make a big difference in how you feel about yourself and your progress. I'd also like to assign some homework related to the meta-thought records we discussed earlier. Would you be willing to try completing a meta-thought record on your own this week, maybe focused on a thought about your progress in therapy?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think I can do that. It'll be good practice for catching those negative thoughts about therapy and challenging them.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jamie. Practicing the meta-thought records can help you build confidence in your ability to challenge negative thoughts about the therapy process itself. Remember, it's okay if it feels challenging at first. The more you practice, the easier it will get.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll give it a try. Is there anything else I should focus on for homework this week?\n\nTherapist: I think continuing to practice the coping strategies we discussed as part of your relapse prevention plan would be really helpful. Maybe pick one or two strategies to focus on, like reviewing your thought records or reaching out for support when you need it.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can definitely do that.\n\nTherapist: Great, Jamie. I'm confident that practicing these skills will help you keep moving forward. Before we end today's session, I want to summarize what we've covered and make sure we're on the same page about the plan going forward.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Reviewing Jamie's progress with thought records and communication skills, introducing meta-thought records, developing a relapse prevention plan, building self-efficacy.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Thought records, communication skills practice, meta-thought records, problem-solving skills, celebrating small successes. In previous sessions, we have also used examining the evidence for and against negative thoughts, considering the costs and benefits of perfectionistic beliefs, loving-kindness meditation, and graded task assignments. We will continue to build on these techniques in future sessions, with a focus on applying them to specific challenges and situations in Jamie's life.\n- Homework assigned: Complete a meta-thought record focused on a thought about progress in therapy, practice one or two coping strategies from the relapse prevention plan (e.g., reviewing thought records, reaching out for support), notice and celebrate one small success each day.\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details: Jamie is making progress in recognizing and challenging negative thoughts related to their chronic pain and depression. They are starting to develop new coping skills, such as mindfulness and self-compassion, but continue to struggle with feelings of frustration, disappointment, and anxiety. Jamie's chronic pain remains a significant challenge that impacts their mood and motivation. They are also struggling with feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt related to their writing and have been avoiding sharing their struggles with their loved ones due to fear of being a burden.\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs: In this session, we identified a core belief: \"I'm fundamentally unlovable and a burden to anyone who gets close to me.\" We also discussed intermediate beliefs related to being powerless and unable to achieve goals due to chronic pain. We started to challenge these beliefs and develop new, more helpful beliefs.\n- Important information to carry forward: Jamie's specific goals and treatment plan, their struggles with chronic pain and its impact on their mood and motivation, and their commitment to completing homework and reporting back on progress. Jamie's support system, including their trusted friend in the writing group and their sibling.\n- Plan for the next session: Review Jamie's progress with homework (meta-thought record, coping strategies practice, celebrating small successes), continue building skills in thought records, mindfulness, and cognitive restructuring, and explore any challenges or successes Jamie has had in implementing their relapse prevention plan.\n\nTherapist: How are you feeling about that summary, Jamie? Does it capture the main points from today's session?\n\nPatient: Yeah, that summary covers everything really well. It's helpful to have it all laid out like that.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad it's helpful, Jamie. Having a clear summary can make it easier to remember what we've discussed and stay focused on your goals. Before we end, I want to check in on how you're feeling emotionally. What's your mood like now, compared to the beginning of the session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful than I was at the beginning. I'm still a little overwhelmed, but I feel like I have some clear steps I can take to keep moving forward.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful, Jamie. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, too. Remember, you don't have to do everything at once. Start small and be patient with yourself. If you find yourself getting stuck or needing extra support, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the reminder to be patient with myself. I'll do my best to keep practicing these skills and reach out if I need help.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. I'm confident that with continued practice and support, you'll keep making progress towards your goals. I look forward to hearing about your successes and challenges in our next session. Until then, take care of yourself and remember to celebrate those small steps along the way.\n\n",
