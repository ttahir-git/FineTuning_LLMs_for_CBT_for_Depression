  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you explaining the stimulus control technique. It makes sense that I need to break the association between my bed and feeling frustrated about not being able to sleep. I'll try getting up and doing something calming if I can't fall asleep within 30 minutes. Maybe I'll try reading a book or doing some gentle stretches, like you suggested.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like great options for calming activities. Remember, the goal is to help your body and mind relax enough to feel sleepy again. It may take some experimentation to find what works best for you. As we continue to work on improving your sleep, I want to acknowledge the progress you've already made. You've been practicing thought challenging and engaging in small activities, which is a significant step forward. I also want to commend you for attending the gathering with your friends, even though it was draining. This shows that you're taking steps to challenge your avoidance and engage in social situations, which is an important part of your recovery.\n\nPatient: Thank you for acknowledging my progress. It's hard for me to see sometimes, because I still feel so overwhelmed by my depression and anxiety. But I know that I'm trying, and it helps to hear that you recognize my efforts.\n\nTherapist: I absolutely recognize your efforts, Jamie. Recovery is a process, and it's not always a linear one. There will be ups and downs, but what matters is that you keep showing up for yourself and putting in the work. Speaking of social situations, you mentioned earlier that you'd like to discuss strategies for handling them without feeling completely drained afterwards. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels draining about these situations?\n\nPatient: I think a big part of it is the anxiety leading up to the event. I often spend days beforehand worrying about what people will think of me, whether I'll say something embarrassing, or if I'll even be able to enjoy myself. By the time the event actually happens, I'm already exhausted from all the worrying. And then during the event, I feel like I have to be \"on\" all the time, making small talk and pretending to be more outgoing than I feel. It's just really draining.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like the anticipation and the pressure to perform socially are major factors in your exhaustion. This is a common experience for people with social anxiety. One strategy that can be helpful is to challenge the thoughts and beliefs that are fueling your anxiety. For example, you mentioned worrying about what people will think of you. What evidence do you have that people are judging you negatively?\n\nPatient: When you put it that way, I guess I don't have much evidence. It's more of a fear than a reality. I assume that people are judging me, but I don't actually know what they're thinking.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Our fears and assumptions can feel very real, even if they're not based on actual evidence. This is where thought challenging can be helpful. When you notice yourself worrying about what people think, try to pause and examine the evidence for and against that thought. Is there any actual evidence that people are judging you negatively, or is it just your fear talking? By challenging these thoughts, you can start to reduce their power over you.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's just hard to remember to do that in the moment, when I'm feeling really anxious.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid point. It can be challenging to remember to use these strategies in the heat of the moment. That's why it's important to practice them regularly, even when you're not feeling particularly anxious. The more you practice, the more automatic these skills will become. Another strategy that can be helpful in social situations is to set realistic expectations for yourself. Instead of putting pressure on yourself to be \"on\" all the time, give yourself permission to take breaks and recharge when you need to. It's okay to step away from the group for a few minutes to do some deep breathing or just have a moment to yourself.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I often feel like I have to be constantly engaged in conversation, but it's exhausting. Giving myself permission to take breaks could help me pace myself better.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Pacing yourself is key. You can also try setting small, achievable goals for yourself in social situations. For example, instead of telling yourself that you have to stay for the entire event and talk to everyone, you could set a goal to stay for an hour and have one or two meaningful conversations. By setting realistic goals, you can build your confidence and reduce the pressure you put on yourself.\n\nPatient: Setting small goals feels more manageable. I think I could handle staying for an hour and having a couple of conversations. It's when I put too much pressure on myself to be perfect that I end up feeling overwhelmed and drained.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Jamie. Perfectionism can be a major driver of anxiety and exhaustion. By setting more realistic expectations and goals for yourself, you can start to break free from that cycle. Remember, you don't have to be perfect to be worthy of love and connection. You are enough, just as you are.\n\nPatient: Thank you for saying that. It's something I struggle to believe sometimes, but I'm working on it. I appreciate you reminding me.\n\nTherapist: I'm happy to remind you as often as you need to hear it, Jamie. You are worthy, regardless of how you perform in social situations or any other area of your life. As we continue to work together, I want to help you internalize that truth more and more.",
