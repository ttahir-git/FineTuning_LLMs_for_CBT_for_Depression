  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate your guidance, Nova. It's helpful to have a plan for managing those feelings of worthlessness when they come up. I know it'll take time and practice to really internalize this new core belief.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Jamie. Changing long-held beliefs is a process, and it's normal to have moments where those old beliefs resurface. The key is to recognize when it's happening and use the tools we've discussed to challenge those thoughts and reinforce your new, more adaptive belief.\n\nPatient: I have a question about the thought records. Sometimes when I'm feeling really down, it's hard to think of evidence against my negative thoughts. What should I do in those moments?\n\nTherapist: That's a great question, Jamie. When you're feeling particularly low, it can be challenging to come up with evidence against negative thoughts. In those moments, it can be helpful to have a pre-prepared list of evidence that you can refer to. This list might include past successes, positive feedback you've received, or moments when you've overcome challenges. Having this list readily available can help you challenge negative thoughts even when you're struggling to generate evidence in the moment.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can definitely work on creating a list like that.\n\nTherapist: Another strategy is to reach out to someone in your support system when you're having trouble challenging negative thoughts on your own. Sometimes, an outside perspective can help you see things more clearly and remind you of your strengths and accomplishments.\n\nPatient: I've noticed that my negative thoughts often come up in specific situations, like when I'm trying to write or when I'm around certain people. Is there a way to prepare for those situations ahead of time?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jamie. One strategy is to create a plan for managing negative thoughts in those specific situations. This might involve preparing some coping statements ahead of time, such as reminders of your new core belief or affirmations of your strengths and capabilities. You can also plan to use relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or grounding exercises, to help you stay calm and focused in those moments.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of having coping statements prepared. I think that could be really helpful.\n\nTherapist: Another important aspect of managing negative thoughts in specific situations is to be mindful of your self-care. Engaging in regular self-care activities, like exercise, hobbies, or spending time with supportive people, can help build up your emotional resilience and make it easier to handle challenging situations when they arise.\n\nPatient: I've been trying to be more consistent with my self-care, but it's still a work in progress. I know I feel better when I'm taking care of myself, but sometimes it's hard to motivate myself to do those things.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Jamie. One strategy is to start small and build up gradually. Choose one or two self-care activities that feel manageable and make a plan to incorporate them into your routine. As you start to experience the benefits of those activities, it can become easier to motivate yourself to continue. It can also be helpful to enlist the support of friends or family members to help you stay accountable and encouraged.\n\nPatient: I think starting small is a good idea. I can try to set some small goals for myself, like taking a short walk each day or reaching out to a friend once a week.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like great goals, Jamie. Remember, self-care doesn't have to be time-consuming or complicated. Even small actions, like taking a few deep breaths or spending a few minutes doing something you enjoy, can make a big difference in your overall well-being.\n\nPatient: I'm starting to see how all of these pieces fit together - the thought records, the core beliefs, the self-care. It's a lot to work on, but I feel like I'm making progress.\n\nTherapist: You absolutely are making progress, Jamie. It's wonderful to see you making these connections and taking steps to challenge negative thoughts and build more adaptive beliefs. Remember, change is a process, and every small step you take is moving you in the right direction.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I'm grateful for your support and guidance through this process.",
