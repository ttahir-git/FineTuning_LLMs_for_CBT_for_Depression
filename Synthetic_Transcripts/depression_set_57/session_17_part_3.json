  "transcript": "Therapist: It's great to hear that your conversation with your friend went well, Jamie. I'm curious, what was going through your mind before you reached out to them? What thoughts or concerns did you have?\n\nPatient: I was really nervous. I kept thinking, \"They're going to think I'm a burden\" or \"They don't really want to hear about my problems.\" I almost didn't reach out because of those thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That took a lot of courage to reach out despite those thoughts. What do you think it was that allowed you to push through that anxiety and have the conversation anyway?\n\nPatient: I think it was because I knew I needed support, and I remembered our previous discussions about how reaching out to others can be helpful. I also tried to challenge those negative thoughts by reminding myself that my friend cares about me and wants to help.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic. You were able to recognize the negative thoughts, challenge them, and then take a positive action despite the anxiety. That's a really powerful example of how the skills we've been practicing can help you overcome obstacles and connect with others.\n\nI'm wondering, how did you feel after the conversation? Did your emotions or thoughts change at all?\n\nPatient: I felt a lot better after talking to my friend. I was less anxious, and I felt more connected and supported. It made me realize that my negative thoughts weren't necessarily true, and that reaching out for help can make a big difference.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Jamie. When we challenge our negative thoughts and take positive actions, it can have a big impact on our emotions and our relationships. And every time you have an experience like that, it's more evidence against those old negative beliefs and in favor of the new, more helpful ones.\n\nI want to switch gears a bit and talk about your relationship with your sibling. You mentioned earlier that you had a tense conversation recently, and that it brought up some negative thoughts and beliefs. Can you tell me more about what happened?\n\nPatient: Yeah, it's been really hard lately. My sibling called me to check in, and I just snapped at them. I was in a lot of pain that day, and I was feeling really frustrated and hopeless. I ended up saying some things I regret, like \"You don't understand what I'm going through\" and \"I feel like I'm a burden to everyone.\"\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a really difficult interaction. I can imagine how painful it must have been to feel like you were lashing out at someone you care about. What do you think was going on for you in that moment?\n\nPatient: I think I was just really overwhelmed. My pain was bad, and I was feeling really alone and hopeless. When my sibling called, I think it just brought up all those feelings of being a burden and not being good enough.\n\nTherapist: That makes a lot of sense. It's really common for our negative thoughts and beliefs to get triggered when we're feeling overwhelmed or in pain. And unfortunately, that can sometimes lead us to say or do things that aren't helpful or that we later regret.\n\nOne thing that can be helpful in those moments is to try to take a step back and notice what's happening. Instead of getting caught up in the negative thoughts and emotions, we can try to observe them with a bit of distance and curiosity.\n\nFor example, you could try saying to yourself, \"I'm noticing that I'm feeling really overwhelmed and frustrated right now. I'm having thoughts that I'm a burden and not good enough. These are difficult thoughts and feelings, but they're not necessarily the truth.\"\n\nDo you think that's something you could try the next time you're in a situation like that with your sibling?\n\nPatient: I think so. It's hard to remember to do that in the moment, but I can see how it could be helpful. I just don't want to keep pushing my sibling away when they're trying to help.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important goal, Jamie. And it's something we can work on together. One thing that can be helpful is to practice communicating your needs and emotions more directly with your sibling.\n\nFor example, instead of snapping at them when you're feeling overwhelmed, you could try saying something like, \"I'm really grateful that you called to check in, but I'm having a really tough pain day and I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed. Could we talk later when I'm feeling a bit better?\"\n\nThat way, you're still acknowledging their effort and your appreciation, but you're also setting a boundary and taking care of yourself.\n\nWhat do you think about that?\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I think I just get so caught up in my own head that I forget that I can communicate what I need. I worry that I'm being too needy or demanding.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common concern, Jamie. But the truth is, everyone has needs, and it's okay to express them. In fact, when we communicate our needs clearly and directly, it can actually bring us closer to the people we care about.\n\nThink about it this way: if your sibling was struggling and needed some space or support, wouldn't you want them to tell you? Wouldn't you appreciate the opportunity to be there for them in the way they needed?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I would. I guess I just need to work on giving myself the same compassion and understanding that I would give to someone else.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And that's something we can continue to work on together. Every time you practice communicating your needs and setting boundaries, it's a step towards building stronger, healthier relationships.\n\nI want to acknowledge that this is hard work, Jamie. You're challenging deeply held beliefs and patterns that have been with you for a long time. But I believe in you and I know you have the strength to do this.\n\nWhat do you think about adding some communication skills practice to your homework this week? We could role-play some scenarios where you practice expressing your needs and emotions to your sibling or other loved ones.\n\nPatient: That sounds really helpful. I think practicing in a safe space like this could make it easier to do in real life.",
