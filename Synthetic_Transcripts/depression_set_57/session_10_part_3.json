  "transcript": "Therapist: I'm glad you're open to trying a behavioral experiment, Jamie. Let's work together to design an experiment that feels manageable and meaningful for you. What do you think about starting with sharing a short piece of writing, maybe a few paragraphs, with a trusted friend or member of your writing group? We can set a specific goal and timeframe for this experiment.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good starting point. I have a friend in my writing group who I trust and feel comfortable sharing my work with. I could share a short piece with them and ask for their honest feedback.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! Let's set a specific goal and timeframe for this experiment. How about aiming to share a piece of writing with your friend within the next week? We can discuss the outcome of the experiment in our next session.\n\nPatient: That seems manageable. I'll set a goal to share a piece of writing with my friend by our next session.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, the purpose of this experiment is to gather evidence that challenges your core belief of not being good enough. Pay attention to your friend's feedback and how it compares to your expectations. This experiment can help you start building a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself and your writing.\n\nPatient: I'll keep that in mind. It's going to be challenging, but I know it's an important step in working on my perfectionism and self-criticism.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jamie. You're taking a brave step towards challenging these long-held beliefs. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are a normal part of the process. Be kind and patient with yourself as you work through this experiment and continue to challenge your negative thoughts and beliefs.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder. I'll do my best to approach this experiment with self-compassion and an open mind.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. I have confidence in your ability to take these steps towards change. Let's continue to explore how your perfectionism and self-criticism show up in other areas of your life. Can you think of another situation where these tendencies arise?",
