  "transcript": "Patient: If it were true that I'm a burden to my loved ones, it would mean that I'm not only causing myself pain but also causing pain to the people I care about most. It would mean that my existence is making their lives harder and that they would be better off without me.\n\nTherapist: That's a really heavy and painful belief, Jamie. I can see how much this thought is impacting you. Let's keep going with the downward arrow technique. If it were true that your existence is making your loved ones' lives harder and that they would be better off without you, what would that mean to you?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm not worthy of love and support, and that I don't deserve to have people in my life who care about me. It would mean that I'm fundamentally unlovable and a burden to anyone who gets close to me.\n\nTherapist: We've reached a core belief here, Jamie. The belief that you're fundamentally unlovable and a burden to anyone who gets close to you. Core beliefs are deeply held beliefs about ourselves, others, and the world that often develop in childhood and can be difficult to change. They're like a lens through which we view our experiences, and they can have a powerful impact on our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\n\nI want to acknowledge how painful this belief must be for you, and how much it's been affecting your relationships and your sense of self-worth. The good news is that core beliefs can be changed, just like we've been working on changing your automatic thoughts and intermediate beliefs.\n\nOne way we can start to challenge this core belief is by looking at the evidence for and against it, just like we did with your automatic thoughts. Can you think of any evidence that contradicts the belief that you're fundamentally unlovable and a burden to anyone who gets close to you?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess there's the fact that my sibling has been so supportive and understanding, even after I opened up to them about my struggles. And I have a few friends from my writing group who seem to genuinely care about me and value my presence in their lives.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the core belief that you're fundamentally unlovable and a burden, Jamie. Your sibling and your friends from your writing group are examples of people who care about you and value your presence in their lives, even when you're struggling.\n\nAnother way we can challenge this core belief is by conducting behavioral experiments, just like we did with the experiment of sharing a small piece of your experience with your sibling. We could design an experiment where you reach out to a friend or loved one for support and see how they respond. This could help you gather more evidence against the belief that you're a burden and fundamentally unlovable.\n\nWhat do you think about that idea? Is there someone you could reach out to for support this week as a behavioral experiment?\n\nPatient: I could try reaching out to my friend from the writing group. They've been going through some struggles of their own lately, and I've been hesitant to share my own struggles because I don't want to add to their burden. But maybe it would be helpful for both of us to lean on each other for support.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great idea, Jamie. Reaching out to your friend from the writing group could be a really powerful behavioral experiment. It could help you challenge the belief that you're a burden and fundamentally unlovable, and it could also strengthen your friendship and provide both of you with much-needed support.\n\nLet's make a plan for how you can reach out to your friend this week. What would you like to say to them, and how do you think they might respond?\n\nPatient: I could start by asking them how they've been doing and if there's anything I can do to support them. And then I could share a little bit about my own struggles, maybe mentioning that I've been feeling down lately and that I'm working on reaching out for support more.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Jamie. Starting by asking your friend how they've been doing and offering support is a really kind and compassionate way to begin the conversation. And then sharing a little bit about your own struggles can help create a sense of mutual support and understanding.\n\nI'm curious, what do you predict your friend's response might be? And how do you think you'll feel after reaching out to them?\n\nPatient: I predict that my friend will be supportive and understanding, just like they always are. They might even share a little bit about their own struggles, and we can commiserate together. And I think I'll feel relieved and less alone after reaching out to them, just like I did after opening up to my sibling.\n\nTherapist: That's a really positive prediction, Jamie. And it's great that you're anticipating feeling relieved and less alone after reaching out to your friend. That's a really good indication that this behavioral experiment could be helpful for you.\n\nLet's make a solid plan for when and how you'll reach out to your friend this week. And then we can check in about how it went at our next session. Does that sound good to you?",
