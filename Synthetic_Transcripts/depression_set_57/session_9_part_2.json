  "transcript": "Patient: I'm not entirely sure what an adaptive core belief would look like for me. I've been so used to thinking negatively about myself for so long that it's hard to imagine believing anything else.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge when working on reframing core beliefs, Jamie. It takes time and practice to develop new, more adaptive beliefs. Let's start by looking at the evidence you've gathered against your negative core belief. You mentioned that you have friends who care about you and that you've accomplished things in your life despite your challenges. What do these pieces of evidence suggest about your worth and deservingness?\n\nPatient: I guess they suggest that I'm not completely worthless, and that I am capable of achieving things and having meaningful relationships. But it's still hard to fully believe that.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, Jamie. Changing core beliefs is a gradual process. Let's try to build on the evidence you've gathered and create a more balanced core belief statement. Instead of \"I'm worthless and undeserving of happiness or success,\" what might be a more adaptive belief that takes into account the evidence you've identified?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I have value and am capable of achieving happiness and success, even though I face challenges.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great start, Jamie! This new belief acknowledges your worth and capabilities while also recognizing the challenges you face. It's more balanced and adaptive than your previous core belief. As we continue our work together, we'll gather more evidence to support this new belief and help you internalize it.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of having a more balanced belief. But what do I do when those feelings of worthlessness come up? They can be really overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: That's a great question, Jamie. When those feelings arise, it can be helpful to have a plan in place. One strategy is to use the thought records we've been working on. When you notice feelings of worthlessness, take a moment to identify the thoughts behind those feelings and challenge them using the evidence you've gathered. Another strategy is to engage in self-care activities that help you feel grounded and connected to your sense of self-worth, such as reaching out to a friend, practicing a hobby you enjoy, or engaging in relaxation techniques like deep breathing or mindfulness.\n\nPatient: I think having a plan like that could be really helpful. I'll try to use the thought records and self-care activities when those feelings come up.\n\nTherapist: Excellent, Jamie. Remember, challenging long-held beliefs takes practice and patience. Be kind to yourself as you work on developing this new, more adaptive core belief. In our next session, we can review your experiences with using these strategies and continue building on the progress you've made.",
