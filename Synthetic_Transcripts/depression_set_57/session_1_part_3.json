  "transcript": "Jamie: You mentioned wanting to help me feel more comfortable leaning on my support system and building new connections. I'm not sure how to do that, though. I feel like I've been pushing people away for so long that I don't even know how to start letting them back in.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Jamie. Rebuilding relationships and forming new connections can feel overwhelming, especially when you've been dealing with depression and anxiety for an extended period. Let's explore some of the coping mechanisms you've been using to manage your mental health. You mentioned that writing has been a helpful outlet for you. Can you tell me more about how writing helps you cope?\n\nJamie: Writing has always been my way of processing my emotions and experiences. When I'm feeling really low, sometimes it's the only thing that helps me make sense of what's going on in my head. It's like I can pour all my thoughts and feelings onto the page, and then I can look at them from a different perspective. It doesn't always make the feelings go away, but it helps me feel a little more in control.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like writing is a powerful tool for you in managing your emotions and gaining a sense of control. That's a great strength to have, and it's something we can build on in therapy. I'm wondering if there are other coping mechanisms you've tried in the past, either on your own or through previous therapy experiences. You mentioned that you sought therapy during graduate school and after coming out as non-binary. What was your experience with therapy like during those times?\n\nJamie: In grad school, therapy helped me learn some basic coping skills, like deep breathing and challenging negative thoughts. It was helpful at the time, but I'm not sure how much I've been using those skills lately. And after coming out, therapy was more about processing my identity and dealing with family issues. It was supportive, but it didn't really address my depression specifically.\n\nTherapist: It's helpful to know what has and hasn't worked for you in the past. We can use that information to tailor our approach in therapy now. Based on what you've shared so far, it seems like your depression is closely tied to your experiences of loss and identity struggles. I'm starting to get a preliminary understanding of your situation, but I want to make sure I'm on the right track. Can you tell me if there's anything I've missed or misunderstood about your experiences?\n\nJamie: I think you've captured the main points. The loss of my career and sense of identity, the family and community issues, the chronic pain - those are all big factors in my depression. I guess the only other thing is that I've been feeling really stuck lately, like I don't know how to move forward or make changes in my life. That's probably the biggest challenge for me right now.",
