  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I'm especially interested in learning about the meta-thought records and developing a relapse prevention plan. I want to make sure I have the tools to keep making progress after our sessions end.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Jamie, and it's wonderful that you're thinking ahead about maintaining your progress. Before we dive into those topics, let's review your homework in more detail. You mentioned that you've been practicing the thought records and communication skills we discussed. Can you tell me more about how that's been going?\n\nPatient: Well, with the thought records, I've been trying to do at least one per day like we talked about. Some days it's easier than others. When my pain is really bad, it's hard to focus on anything else, let alone challenge my thoughts. But I have noticed that when I do the thought records, it helps me see things from a different perspective.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been consistent with the thought records, even though it's been challenging at times. Recognizing that it's harder to do when your pain is severe is an important insight. What about the communication skills practice? How has that been going?\n\nPatient: The conversation with my sibling went well, like I mentioned earlier. I've also been trying to be more open with my friend from the writing group. It's still scary to be vulnerable, but it's getting a little easier each time. I'm starting to see that people do want to support me, even when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant realization, Jamie. Challenging that belief about being a burden is a big step forward. It takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable and open up to others, and it's great that you're seeing the benefits of doing so. Have there been any other challenges or successes with the homework that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: One challenge I've had is with collecting evidence for the new core belief that I'm good enough and can succeed. Sometimes it feels like the evidence for the old belief is so much stronger, you know? Like, I see all the ways I'm not measuring up, and it's hard to focus on the positives.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge when trying to shift core beliefs, Jamie. Our brains are wired to pay more attention to negative information, so it can feel like the evidence for the old belief is stronger. But the fact that you're noticing the positives, even if they feel small, is a big deal. Every piece of evidence for the new belief is a step in the right direction. What's one piece of evidence you've collected so far?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess one piece of evidence is that I've been able to keep writing, even though it's been hard. I haven't given up, even on the days when I feel like I'm not good enough. That takes perseverance, which is a strength of mine.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Jamie. Perseverance is a huge strength, and the fact that you've been able to keep writing despite the challenges is a clear piece of evidence that you're good enough and can succeed. It's okay if the evidence feels small at first \u2013 every bit counts. As we keep collecting evidence, it will get easier to see the new belief as true.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just need to keep practicing and reminding myself of the evidence I've collected so far.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. And that's where the meta-thought records can come in handy. Meta-thought records are a way to explore your thoughts and beliefs about the therapy process itself. For example, you might have a thought like, \"I'm not making enough progress in therapy,\" or \"I should be further along by now.\" Those thoughts can be discouraging and make it harder to keep going. With meta-thought records, we can challenge those thoughts and look at the evidence for your progress in a more balanced way.\n\nPatient: That sounds really helpful. Can you give me an example of how to do a meta-thought record?\n\nTherapist: Sure, Jamie. Let's say you have the thought, \"I'm not making enough progress in therapy.\" First, we would identify the emotion that goes with that thought \u2013 maybe it's discouragement or frustration. Then, we would look at the evidence for and against that thought. Evidence for the thought might be that you're still struggling with depression symptoms, or that you haven't met all your goals yet. Evidence against the thought might be that you've been consistent with the homework, you've had some successful conversations with your loved ones, and you've been able to keep writing despite the challenges. Then, we would come up with a more balanced thought based on the evidence, like \"I'm making progress in therapy, even though I still have challenges to work on.\" How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That makes a lot of sense. It's kind of like taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture, instead of getting stuck in the negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. Meta-thought records can help us take a more balanced perspective on the therapy process and recognize the progress we've made, even when it feels like we're not moving fast enough. Would you like to try doing a meta-thought record together now?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think that would be really helpful. Let's do it.",
