  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for our second session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. I'm feeling a bit low today, but I'm hoping our session will help me gain some clarity and strategies to cope with my depression.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're here, and I'm committed to working with you to develop those coping strategies. Before we continue, let's set an agenda for today's session. We'll start by reviewing the homework I assigned last time, which was to keep a thought record of negative thoughts and triggering situations. Then, I'd like to introduce the CBT framework and explore your specific thought patterns related to your depression. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I did my best to keep track of my thoughts and triggers throughout the week.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Let's start by reviewing your thought record. Can you share some of the negative thoughts you experienced and the situations that triggered them?",
