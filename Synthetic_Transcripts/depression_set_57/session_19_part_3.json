  "transcript": "Patient: I think the hardest part is feeling like I'm being a burden on others. I don't want to constantly be complaining about my pain or asking for help.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to worry about being a burden. Many people struggle with asking for help because they don't want to inconvenience others. But it's important to remember that the people who care about you want to support you. Have you had any experiences where reaching out for help turned out positively?\n\nPatient: Well, there was one time recently where I was having a really bad pain day, and I reached out to my sibling. They came over and just sat with me, and it actually helped a lot. It was nice to not feel so alone in it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. It sounds like reaching out to your sibling not only provided you with some comfort but also helped you feel less alone. That's a really valuable thing. What do you think made it easier to reach out in that situation?\n\nPatient: I think it was because I knew my sibling wouldn't judge me. They've always been really understanding about my pain.\n\nTherapist: Having someone who understands and doesn't judge is so important. It's great that you have that kind of support from your sibling. What about other people in your life? Are there others who you feel comfortable reaching out to?\n\nPatient: There are a couple of people in my writing group who I've gotten closer to. I haven't really opened up to them about my pain yet, but I think they'd be supportive.\n\nTherapist: That's good to hear. It can be scary to open up to new people, but it sounds like you have a good sense of who might be supportive. What do you think might be a first step in reaching out to someone in your writing group?\n\nPatient: Maybe I could start by just mentioning that I've been having a hard time with my pain lately. I don't have to go into all the details, but it might help them understand if I'm not as present or productive as usual.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great first step. Just mentioning that you're struggling, without going into all the details, can open the door to more support. And it can help others understand what's going on with you, so they don't make assumptions. How do you think you'd feel after taking that first step?\n\nPatient: I think I'd feel a bit nervous, but also relieved. It's hard to keep things bottled up, and it might be nice to feel a little more understood.\n\nTherapist: It's normal to feel nervous, but I'm glad you think it would also be a relief. Bottling things up can be really draining, and feeling understood can make a big difference. Remember, you can take small steps and go at your own pace. You don't have to share everything all at once.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I can start small and see how it goes. I don't have to do it all at once.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And remember, the people who care about you want to support you. It might feel scary to reach out, but it can also bring you closer to others and help you feel less alone. What do you think about making a plan for how you might reach out to someone in your writing group this week?\n\nPatient: I think that's a good idea. I could plan to mention it casually at our next meeting, just to see how it feels.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. And remember, you can always check in with me about how it goes. I'm here to support you as you take these steps.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate that. It feels good to have a plan.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. I'm glad it feels good to have a plan. Remember, small steps can lead to big changes over time. And you don't have to do this alone.",
