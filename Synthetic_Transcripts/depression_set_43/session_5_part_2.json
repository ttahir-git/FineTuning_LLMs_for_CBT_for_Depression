  "transcript": "Therapist: Great, let's dive into the thought record example. Can you think of a situation from the past week where you experienced a strong emotion or a distressing thought?\n\nPatient: Yes, there was a moment during one of my classes where I felt really overwhelmed and hopeless. We were discussing a complex topic, and I couldn't seem to grasp the concepts. I started thinking that I'm not smart enough to be in this PhD program and that I'll never be able to succeed.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Noor. Let's use this situation to walk through the thought record process. First, we'll identify the situation or trigger, which you've already done. Next, let's explore the emotions you experienced and their intensity. What emotions did you feel in that moment, and how intense were they on a scale of 0 to 100?\n\nPatient: I felt overwhelmed, hopeless, and like a failure. The intensity was probably around 85 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have the situation, emotions, and their intensity. Now, let's identify the automatic thoughts that went through your mind during this situation. You mentioned thinking that you're not smart enough and that you'll never succeed. Were there any other thoughts that stood out to you?\n\nPatient: I also thought that everyone else in the class probably understands the material better than I do, and that I'm just not cut out for this level of academic work.\n\nTherapist: Those are important thoughts to recognize. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not smart enough or that you'll never succeed?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been struggling to keep up with the coursework, and I feel like I'm always behind. I also haven't been participating much in class discussions because I'm afraid of saying something wrong.\n\nTherapist: And what about evidence against these thoughts? Have there been times when you've succeeded in your academic work or received positive feedback?\n\nPatient: I guess there have been a few assignments where I've done well, and my advisor has told me that they believe in my ability to complete the program. But it's hard to focus on those moments when I'm feeling so overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Noor. It's common for us to focus on the negative evidence when we're feeling down, but it's important to consider the full picture. Now, let's try to come up with an alternative thought that takes into account both the evidence for and against your initial thoughts. What might be a more balanced way of looking at this situation?\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought could be that while I'm struggling with this particular topic, it doesn't mean I'm not capable of succeeding in the program overall. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and I've had successes in other areas of my academic work.\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Noor. It acknowledges the challenge you're facing while also recognizing your past successes and the support you have from your advisor. Now, let's re-rate the intensity of your emotions after considering this alternative thought. How intense do those feelings of hopelessness and being a failure feel now on a scale of 0 to 100?\n\nPatient: They're still there, but maybe not as strong. Maybe around 60 out of 100 now.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant decrease in intensity, Noor. This shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing our emotions. By examining the evidence and considering alternative perspectives, we can start to shift our emotional responses.\n\nPatient: I can see how that works, but it's still hard to do this in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Noor. It takes practice to be able to catch those automatic thoughts and challenge them in the moment. That's why we start by practicing with situations that have already happened, like we just did. Over time, it becomes easier to apply these skills in real-time.",
