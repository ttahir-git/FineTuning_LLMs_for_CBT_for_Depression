  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I'm particularly interested in discussing the emotional resistance I've been experiencing and how we can work through that.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point to focus on, Noor. Emotional resistance can be a significant barrier to engaging in activities that have the potential to improve our mood. Let's start by exploring this further.\n\nCan you think of a specific instance this past week where you experienced emotional resistance when trying to engage in a planned activity?\n\nPatient: Yes, actually. I had planned to go for a walk in the park near my house, as we had discussed. But when the time came, I started feeling anxious and overwhelmed. I kept thinking that I wouldn't enjoy it and that I should be focusing on my studies instead.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Noor. Let's break down what happened there, using the CBT triangle we've discussed before. Can you identify the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that were present in that situation?\n\nPatient: Well, my thoughts were that I wouldn't enjoy the walk and that I should be studying instead. My feelings were anxiety and overwhelm. And my behavior was that I ended up not going for the walk and stayed home instead.\n\nTherapist: That's a great analysis, Noor. You've identified how your thoughts and feelings influenced your behavior. Now, let's take a closer look at the thoughts you mentioned. Can you think of any evidence that supports or refutes the idea that you wouldn't enjoy the walk?\n\nPatient: I guess there's no real evidence that I wouldn't enjoy it. In the past, when I've pushed myself to go for walks, I usually end up feeling better afterward. And even if I don't enjoy it as much as I'd like, it's still better than staying home and doing nothing.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent point, Noor. You've identified that your past experiences actually contradict the thought that you wouldn't enjoy the walk. This is a great example of how we can use evidence to challenge our negative thoughts.\n\nNow, let's address the thought that you should be focusing on your studies instead. Is there a way to find a balance between self-care activities and your academic responsibilities?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could schedule my walks during breaks from studying or after I've completed a certain amount of work. That way, I'm still prioritizing my studies but also making time for self-care.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Noor. Finding a balance between responsibilities and self-care is essential for maintaining good mental health. By scheduling your walks during breaks or after completing work, you're setting yourself up for success in both areas.\n\nLet's discuss how you can use positive self-talk to help you overcome emotional resistance in the moment. What are some encouraging things you could say to yourself when you're feeling anxious or overwhelmed about engaging in an activity?",
