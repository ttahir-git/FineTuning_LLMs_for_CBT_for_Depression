  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'd like to start by checking in with you. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or notable experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the homework assignments you gave me. I've been completing thought records and trying to challenge my negative thoughts, but it's been challenging at times. I've also been attempting to gather evidence for a new core belief, but I'm struggling to fully believe it. My mood has been up and down, with some good days and some really tough ones.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you've been working on the homework assignments, even though it hasn't been easy. It's common to experience ups and downs in the process of challenging long-held beliefs. I want to acknowledge the effort you've been putting in. \n\nFor today's session, I'd like to suggest focusing on a few key areas. First, we could review some of your thought records and discuss any challenges or insights that came up as you worked on them. We could also explore your progress with the Positive Data Log and talk about any barriers or successes you've had in gathering evidence for a new core belief. \n\nAdditionally, I'd like to hear about your experiences with taking small steps towards engaging with your community and honoring your values. We can continue to address self-compassion and perfectionism as well. Does this sound like a helpful plan for our session today? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?",
