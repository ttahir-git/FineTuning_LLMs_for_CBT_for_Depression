  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for our third session. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last meeting. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate, and I want to encourage you to use your judgment and critical thinking skills as we work together. Lastly, I want to remind you that if you ever experience thoughts of self-harm or suicide, it's crucial to seek immediate help from a qualified professional or emergency service, as I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being transparent about your capabilities. I'm ready to continue our work together.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by setting an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review your homework from the previous session, finalize our conceptualization of your depression, and begin setting specific, measurable goals for your therapy journey. How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I don't have anything else to add right now.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's start by reviewing your homework. Last session, I asked you to continue keeping thought records, focusing on identifying cognitive distortions and challenging them by examining evidence and considering alternative interpretations. I also asked you to choose one small, achievable goal related to managing anger and frustration in academic or relationship settings and practice implementing a new coping strategy. Can you share your experience with these tasks?",
