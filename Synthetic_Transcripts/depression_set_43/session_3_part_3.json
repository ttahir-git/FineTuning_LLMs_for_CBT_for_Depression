  "transcript": "Therapist: That's a great example of using evidence to challenge all-or-nothing thinking. Now, let's look at the last column of the thought record, where we generate alternative thoughts based on the evidence. What's a more balanced way to view this situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be, \"I'm behind on my readings, but I've been able to catch up before, so I can probably do it again if I put in the effort.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent! That's a much more realistic and adaptive way to view the situation. When we practice generating alternative thoughts based on evidence, it can help us break out of negative thought patterns over time. How did it feel to go through this process?\n\nPatient: It felt a little strange at first, because I'm so used to thinking in extremes. But it was helpful to see how I could challenge those thoughts with evidence. I think it could be a useful tool for me to practice.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you found it helpful. As we continue to work together, we'll practice more techniques like this to help you manage your depression and anger. Speaking of our work together, I'd like to spend some time finalizing your therapy goals and creating a tentative treatment plan. We've discussed some of your goals already, like managing anger and frustration in academic and relationship settings, and improving your academic performance. Are there any other goals you'd like to work on in therapy?\n\nPatient: I think I'd also like to work on processing some of the trauma from my military experience. It's something I've been avoiding for a long time, but I know it's impacting my mental health.\n\nTherapist: That's a brave and important goal, Noor. Processing trauma can be difficult, but it can also be a powerful step in healing. We can incorporate trauma-focused techniques into our work together, and go at a pace that feels safe and manageable for you. I'll be here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, that means a lot to me. I know it won't be easy, but I'm ready to start working on it.\n\nTherapist: I'm here to support you in that process, Noor. Based on the goals we've discussed, I'd like to propose a tentative treatment plan. We can start by focusing on CBT techniques to manage your depression and anger, like thought records and behavioral activation. As we build those skills, we can start to gently explore your trauma history and work on processing those experiences. We'll also continue to monitor your progress and adjust the plan as needed. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I like that we have a plan in place, but that we can also be flexible and adjust as we go.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Therapy is a collaborative process, and we'll work together to make sure it's meeting your needs. Do you have any concerns or questions about the therapy process that we haven't addressed yet?\n\nPatient: I think my main concern is just that I've tried therapy before and it didn't really help. I'm worried that this time will be the same.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, Noor. I want to acknowledge that therapy can be a difficult and sometimes frustrating process, and it's not always a linear path. There might be times when it feels like we're not making progress, or when the work is challenging. But I also want to assure you that I'm committed to working with you to find the tools and strategies that work best for you. We'll keep checking in about what's working and what's not, and we'll adjust our approach as needed. And remember, you've already made progress just by showing up today and being willing to engage in this process. That takes a lot of courage and strength.\n\nPatient: Thank you for saying that. It helps to know that we can be flexible and adjust as we go. I'm willing to give it a try.",
