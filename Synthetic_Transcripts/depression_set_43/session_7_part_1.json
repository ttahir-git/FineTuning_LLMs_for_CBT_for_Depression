  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for our seventh session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I'm here to support you, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted support person. Lastly, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like facial expressions or body language.\n\nWith that said, I'm here to listen and support you in any way I can. How have you been since our last session? I'd love to hear about any changes, challenges, or successes you've experienced.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like thought records and behavioral activation. It hasn't been easy, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood when I actively engage in the activities we planned. However, I still struggle with emotional resistance and find it hard to motivate myself at times.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we've discussed, Noor. Small improvements are still progress, and it's essential to acknowledge and celebrate those victories. Emotional resistance is a common challenge, and we can definitely explore that further today.\n\nBefore we set our agenda, can you share a bit more about your experience with emotional resistance? What thoughts or feelings come up when you try to engage in planned activities?\n\nPatient: When I think about doing the activities we planned, I often feel overwhelmed and anxious. I start to think that I won't enjoy them or that I'll fail at completing them. Sometimes, I even feel guilty for taking time for myself when I have so many other responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Noor. Those thoughts and feelings are valid and understandable. Many people experience similar concerns when trying to make changes in their lives. Today, we can work on addressing some of those thoughts and feelings, and explore ways to make engaging in activities feel more manageable.\n\nBased on what you've shared, I suggest we focus on the following topics today:\n1. Reviewing your thought records and discussing any challenges or insights that arose during the week\n2. Exploring your progress with behavioral activation and discussing any barriers or successes, focusing on your experience with graded task assignment and positive self-talk techniques\n3. Continuing to build on distress tolerance techniques and introduce additional strategies as needed\n4. Discussing the results of your mood monitoring and exploring any patterns or insights gained from tracking your mood in relation to planned activities\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
