  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying to complete the thought records as homework, but I find it challenging to identify the evidence for and against my negative thoughts. Sometimes, it feels like the evidence supporting my negative thoughts is much stronger than the evidence against them.\n\nTherapist: It's common to feel that way, Noor, especially when you've been dealing with negative thoughts for a long time. Our goal is to help you develop a more balanced perspective by examining the evidence objectively. Let's look at one of your thought records together and see if we can find some additional evidence against the negative thoughts.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds helpful. Here's an example from earlier this week: I was struggling to complete an assignment for my PhD program, and I had the thought, \"I'm not capable of succeeding in this program.\" The evidence for this thought was that I've been having trouble focusing and comprehending the material, and I've missed a couple of deadlines.\n\nTherapist: I understand how those experiences can make you feel like you're not capable. However, I wonder if there's some evidence against that thought that we might be overlooking. Have there been times in the past when you've successfully completed assignments or received positive feedback on your work?\n\nPatient: Well, now that I think about it, I did receive a good grade on my last paper, and my professor commented that I had some insightful ideas. And I've managed to complete other assignments, even if they were challenging.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're not capable of succeeding in the program. It shows that you have the ability to produce good work and that your ideas are valued by your professors. Let's add that to your thought record.\n\nPatient: You're right. I guess I tend to focus more on the negative experiences and discount the positive ones.\n\nTherapist: That's a common cognitive distortion called \"disqualifying the positive.\" It's important to recognize and challenge these distortions to develop a more balanced and accurate view of yourself and your abilities.\n\nPatient: I can see how that distortion has been affecting my thoughts. I'll try to be more aware of it when completing my thought records.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Noor. Remember, it takes practice to identify and challenge cognitive distortions, so be patient with yourself as you work on this skill.\n\nPatient: I'll do my best. I also wanted to mention that I've been struggling with the behavioral activation part of my homework. I went for a walk with my camera and volunteered at the community center, but I didn't notice a significant improvement in my mood.\n\nTherapist: It's okay if you didn't notice a significant improvement right away. The goal of behavioral activation is to gradually increase your engagement in activities that have the potential to boost your mood or provide a sense of accomplishment. It's a process, and it may take some time to notice the benefits. Let's explore your experience with these activities a bit more.",
