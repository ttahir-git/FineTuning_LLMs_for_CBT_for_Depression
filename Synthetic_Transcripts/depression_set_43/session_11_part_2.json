  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I had a situation a few days ago where I received feedback on a paper I submitted for my PhD program. The feedback was mostly positive, but there were a few points of criticism. I immediately started thinking that I'm not cut out for this program and that I'll never be able to succeed in academia.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Noor. Let's break this down using the thought record. What emotions did you experience when you received the feedback?\n\nPatient: I felt really discouraged and hopeless. I think I also felt a bit angry with myself for not doing a better job on the paper.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you experienced feelings of discouragement, hopelessness, and self-directed anger. How intense were these emotions on a scale of 0 to 100?\n\nPatient: The discouragement and hopelessness were probably around 80, and the anger was maybe 60.\n\nTherapist: Now, let's identify the automatic thought that led to these emotions. What was going through your mind when you received the feedback?\n\nPatient: My first thought was, \"I'm not good enough for this program, and I'll never succeed in academia.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a significant thought, and it seems to be tied to your core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" Let's explore this further. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, the fact that I received criticism on my paper feels like evidence that I'm not good enough. I also think about how long it takes me to complete assignments compared to my peers.\n\nTherapist: I understand how that feedback and comparison to others can feel like evidence supporting your thought. Now, let's consider evidence against this thought. What are some reasons why this thought might not be entirely accurate?\n\nPatient: I guess I could consider the positive feedback I received on the paper. And I have made progress in the program so far, even if it's slower than I'd like.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent point, Noor. It's essential to acknowledge the progress you've made and the positive aspects of the feedback. Let's try to create an alternative thought that takes both the evidence for and against your initial thought into account. What might be a more balanced way of looking at this situation?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"Although I received some criticism, I also got positive feedback, and I'm making progress in the program, even if it's not perfect.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Noor. It acknowledges the areas for improvement while also recognizing your progress and the positive aspects of the feedback. Now, if you were to believe this alternative thought, how intense do you think your emotions of discouragement, hopelessness, and anger would be on that 0 to 100 scale?\n\nPatient: I think the discouragement and hopelessness would be lower, maybe around 50. The anger might be around 30.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in the intensity of your emotions, Noor. This shows how challenging your automatic thoughts can help shift your emotional response to a situation. I'm curious, what does this exercise bring up for you?",
