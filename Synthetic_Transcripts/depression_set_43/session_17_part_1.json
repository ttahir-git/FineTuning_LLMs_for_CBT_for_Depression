  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like completing thought records and focusing on self-compassion. It's been challenging at times, but I think I'm making some progress. I've also been trying to break down overwhelming tasks into smaller steps, which has helped me feel more manageable.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed and that you're noticing some progress. Breaking down tasks into smaller steps can be incredibly helpful in managing feelings of being overwhelmed. Can you share a specific example of how you've applied these techniques since our last session?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I had a big assignment due for my PhD program, and I was feeling really anxious and overwhelmed about it. Normally, I would have procrastinated and then rushed to complete it at the last minute, but instead, I tried to break it down into smaller tasks and focus on one step at a time. I also used a thought record to challenge some of the negative thoughts I was having about the assignment, like \"I'm not good enough to complete this\" or \"I'm going to fail.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example of how you've been applying the techniques we've discussed. Breaking down the assignment into smaller tasks and using a thought record to challenge negative thoughts are both excellent strategies for managing anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed. How did it feel to approach the assignment in this way?\n\nPatient: It felt really different from how I usually approach assignments. I was able to focus more on the present moment and the task at hand, rather than getting caught up in negative thoughts about the future. It was still challenging, but I felt more in control and less overwhelmed overall.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Noor. It's great that you were able to notice a difference in how you felt when approaching the assignment in a more mindful and structured way. This is a great example of how the techniques we've been practicing can be applied to real-life situations. Now, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I'd like to continue working on challenging my negative thoughts and core beliefs, especially around not being good enough. I've noticed that this belief comes up a lot for me, not just in my academic work but also in my personal life and relationships.\n\nTherapist: That's a great topic to focus on today, Noor. Challenging negative core beliefs is an important part of the therapeutic process. We can also continue to explore how your cultural and religious beliefs may be influencing these thoughts and beliefs. Additionally, we can discuss your progress with self-compassion and see if there are any other techniques or strategies that might be helpful for you. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds great, Nova. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into these topics.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. So, our agenda for today's session will include:\n\n1. Continuing to challenge negative thoughts and core beliefs, particularly around not being good enough\n2. Exploring the influence of cultural and religious beliefs on thoughts and behaviors\n3. Discussing progress with self-compassion and introducing additional techniques if needed\n\nLet's start by exploring the negative core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" Can you share a recent example of when this belief came up for you?",
