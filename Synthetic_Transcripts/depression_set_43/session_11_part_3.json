  "transcript": "Patient: I'm starting to see how my automatic thoughts are connected to my core belief of not being good enough. It's a pattern I've been repeating for a long time.\n\nTherapist: You're making an important connection, Noor. Recognizing these patterns is a crucial step in the process of change. Let's explore this further. Can you think of other situations where this core belief might be influencing your thoughts and emotions?\n\nPatient: Definitely. I think it comes up a lot in my academic work. Whenever I face a challenge or receive criticism, my mind immediately goes to \"I'm not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Noor. This core belief seems to be deeply ingrained, and it's likely been reinforced by various experiences throughout your life. In CBT, we call these kinds of deep-seated beliefs \"core beliefs\" because they form the foundation of how we see ourselves, others, and the world around us. They often develop early in life and can be influenced by our experiences, culture, and upbringing.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can see how my experiences in my family and during my military service might have contributed to this belief.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Our core beliefs are shaped by our life experiences, and they can be difficult to change because they feel so true and automatic. However, just because a belief feels true doesn't mean it is true. That's where we can use CBT techniques to examine and challenge these beliefs.\n\nPatient: I'm starting to understand that, but it's still hard to believe that I can change something that feels so deeply ingrained.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, Noor. Changing core beliefs is a process, and it takes time and practice. The good news is that you've already started this process by recognizing the connection between your automatic thoughts and your core belief. The next step is to continue challenging these thoughts and gathering evidence that supports a more balanced and realistic perspective.\n\nPatient: How do I do that?\n\nTherapist: One way is to continue using thought records to examine the evidence for and against your automatic thoughts. As you practice this skill, you'll start to see patterns and develop alternative thoughts that are more balanced and based on evidence.\n\nAnother technique we can use is called the \"Positive Data Log.\" This involves actively looking for and recording evidence that supports a new, more adaptive core belief. For example, if you want to develop a new core belief like \"I am capable and competent,\" you would look for examples from your life that support this belief, such as times when you've overcome challenges, received positive feedback, or achieved a goal.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good idea. I think I could try that.\n\nTherapist: Great! I'd be happy to help you get started with a Positive Data Log. Remember, the goal is to gather evidence that supports your new, more balanced core belief. It might feel unnatural at first, but with practice, it will become easier to notice and record these positive experiences.\n\nPatient: I'm willing to give it a try. I know it won't be easy, but I'm starting to see how these negative core beliefs have been holding me back.\n\nTherapist: That's a powerful realization, Noor. Recognizing the impact of these beliefs is an important step in the process of change. As you continue to practice these skills and gather evidence for your new core belief, you'll likely find that your thoughts and emotions start to shift in a more positive direction.\n\nPatient: I hope so. It's been a tough journey, but I'm starting to feel more hopeful.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Noor. Remember, change is possible, and you've already taken some important steps in this process. Let's continue to work together to challenge these negative core beliefs and develop a more balanced and realistic perspective.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Noor. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's keep practicing these skills and exploring how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are connected. I'm confident that with time and practice, you'll start to see positive changes in your life.",
