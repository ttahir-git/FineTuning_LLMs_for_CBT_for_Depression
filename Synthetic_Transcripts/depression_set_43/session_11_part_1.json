  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned, but it's been challenging. I've been feeling quite low and unmotivated, which has made it hard to complete the thought records and practice self-compassion consistently. I'm also struggling with my academic work, as I feel like I'm not making enough progress.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it can be difficult to stay consistent with the homework when you're feeling low and unmotivated. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have ups and downs. Let's explore what's been getting in the way of completing the thought records and practicing self-compassion. Can you tell me more about the specific challenges you've faced with these tasks?\n\nPatient: Well, with the thought records, I find it hard to identify the cognitive distortions in my thoughts. I know we've discussed them before, but when I'm in the moment, I struggle to pinpoint which distortion I'm experiencing. As for self-compassion, I feel like I don't deserve to be kind to myself when I'm not making progress in my academic work.\n\nTherapist: It's common to have difficulty identifying cognitive distortions at first. It takes practice to recognize them in the moment. Perhaps we can review some examples together and practice identifying them during our session today. Regarding self-compassion, it's important to remember that being kind to yourself is not dependent on your academic progress. You deserve compassion and understanding regardless of your achievements. What do you think about including these topics in our agenda for today's session?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I think reviewing cognitive distortions and practicing identifying them would be helpful. And I'm open to discussing self-compassion further, even though it's a challenging topic for me.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's add those to our agenda. I also think it would be beneficial to discuss the connection between your academic progress and your feelings of self-worth. We can explore how perfectionism might be influencing this relationship. Additionally, I'd like to check in on your behavioral activation and see how engaging in small activities has been going. Does this agenda sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to include?\n\nPatient: The agenda sounds good to me. I agree that discussing the connection between my academic progress and self-worth is important. I haven't been as consistent with the behavioral activation as I'd like, so it would be good to touch on that as well. I can't think of anything else to add right now.\n\nTherapist: Alright, so our agenda for today's session includes:\n1. Reviewing cognitive distortions and practicing identifying them\n2. Discussing self-compassion and its relationship to self-worth\n3. Exploring the connection between academic progress and feelings of self-worth\n4. Checking in on behavioral activation progress\n\nLet's start by reviewing cognitive distortions. Can you tell me about a recent situation where you struggled to identify the distortion in your thoughts?",
