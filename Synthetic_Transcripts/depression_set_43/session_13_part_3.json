  "transcript": "Patient: I think some self-compassionate phrases that could work for me are \"I'm doing my best, and that's enough\" and \"It's okay to make mistakes. I'm still learning.\" It's hard to remember to use them in the moment, but I think practicing them could help.\n\nTherapist: Those are great self-compassionate phrases, Noor. It's wonderful that you're able to identify words of encouragement that feel authentic and supportive to you. You're right that it can be challenging to remember to use them in the moment, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed or stuck in negative thoughts.\n\nOne strategy that can be helpful is to create visual reminders of your self-compassionate phrases. You could write them on sticky notes and put them in places where you'll see them often, like on your mirror or computer screen. You could also set a reminder on your phone to take a few moments each day to practice saying these phrases to yourself.\n\nAnother strategy is to pair your self-compassionate phrases with a physical gesture, like placing your hand on your heart or taking a deep breath. This can help anchor the phrases in your body and make them feel more real and meaningful.\n\nWhat do you think about those strategies? Do you have any other ideas for how you could remind yourself to practice self-compassion throughout the day?\n\nPatient: I like the idea of putting sticky notes around my apartment. I spend a lot of time at home studying, so having visual reminders could be really helpful. I could also set a reminder on my phone to take a few deep breaths and repeat the phrases to myself.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like great strategies, Noor. Using visual reminders and setting aside dedicated time to practice self-compassion can be really effective in helping to shift your thought patterns over time.\n\nAnother way to reinforce your new balanced belief and practice self-compassion is to engage in activities that support your new perspective. This could involve doing things that challenge your negative core belief and provide evidence for your new balanced belief.\n\nFor example, if your balanced belief is \"I have both strengths and areas for growth, and I am working on accepting myself as I am,\" you could engage in activities that highlight your strengths or provide opportunities for growth. This could be something like volunteering in your community, which you mentioned is important to you, or taking on a new challenge in your studies that pushes you outside your comfort zone.\n\nEngaging in activities that support your new belief can help reinforce it on a deeper level and provide experiential evidence that it's true. It can also be a way of practicing self-compassion in action, by treating yourself with kindness and understanding as you try new things and work on personal growth.\n\nWhat do you think about that idea? Can you think of any activities that could support your new balanced belief and provide opportunities for self-compassion?",
