  "transcript": "Patient: I'm feeling a bit more confident about using the skills on my own. It's still a little scary, but I know I have the tools I need.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Noor. It's normal to feel some apprehension about ending therapy, but you've made significant progress and have demonstrated your ability to apply CBT principles effectively. Remember, you can always refer back to your coping cards, Positive Data Log, and other resources we've created together.\n\nAs we wrap up our session today, I want to assign some homework to help you continue practicing your skills. First, I'd like you to add at least three new pieces of evidence to your Positive Data Log this week. Look for moments when you challenge perfectionistic thoughts, engage in self-compassion, or take steps towards your goals.\n\nSecond, I'd like you to practice using your coping cards in a real-life situation, like the family gathering you mentioned earlier. Before the event, review your cards and remind yourself of the more balanced thoughts you can have. After the gathering, reflect on how using the cards influenced your emotions and behaviors.\n\nFinally, I encourage you to share your relapse prevention plan with a trusted friend or family member. Talking about your early warning signs and coping strategies with someone else can help you feel more supported and accountable.\n\nHow do you feel about this homework, Noor? Do you have any questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: The homework seems manageable. I like the idea of sharing my relapse prevention plan with someone close to me. It makes me feel less alone in this process.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Noor. Sharing your plan with others can help create a sense of connection and support. I'm glad you feel comfortable with the homework assignments.\n\nBefore we end our session, I want to check in on your current mood. How are you feeling right now?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a mix of emotions. I'm proud of the progress I've made, but I also feel a bit sad that our sessions are coming to an end.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a sense of loss as we approach the end of our work together. It's a sign of the meaningful connection we've built and the growth you've experienced. Remember, endings are also opportunities for new beginnings. You're now equipped with the skills and knowledge to continue your journey of self-growth and self-compassion independently.\n\nI want to take a moment to acknowledge the hard work you've put into this process, Noor. You've shown great courage in facing your challenges, and you've made significant strides in building a more balanced and self-accepting mindset. I have full confidence in your ability to maintain your progress and continue thriving.\n\nThank you for trusting me to be a part of your journey. It's been an honor to work with you.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate all the support and guidance you've provided. I feel more prepared to handle my depression and perfectionism now.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Noor. Remember, you've always had the strength within you. Our work together has simply helped you tap into that inner resilience.\n\nLet's schedule our next session in two weeks. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
