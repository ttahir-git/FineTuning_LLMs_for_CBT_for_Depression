  "transcript": "Patient: I've been working on the thought records, and I've noticed that I often engage in all-or-nothing thinking, especially when it comes to my academic performance. If I don't meet my own high standards, I feel like a complete failure. I've been trying to challenge these thoughts by looking at the evidence and considering alternative perspectives, like the fact that I'm still making progress even if I'm not perfect.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Noor. All-or-nothing thinking, also known as black-and-white thinking, is a common cognitive distortion that can contribute to feelings of depression and frustration. By recognizing this pattern and challenging it with evidence and alternative perspectives, you're taking an important step in changing your thought patterns. Let's continue to work on this skill throughout our sessions.\n\nPatient: I also set a small goal for managing my anger and frustration in academic settings. I decided to try taking a short break and practicing deep breathing when I start to feel overwhelmed or frustrated with my coursework. I've found that it helps me calm down and refocus, but I don't always remember to do it in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Setting small, achievable goals is a key part of CBT, and I'm glad to hear that you've found a coping strategy that works for you. It's normal to struggle with remembering to use new skills in the moment, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. One way to make it easier to remember is to create a visual reminder, like a sticky note on your computer or a note in your phone, that prompts you to take a break and practice deep breathing when you start to feel frustrated.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I'll try setting a reminder on my phone to help me remember to take breaks and breathe.\n\nTherapist: Great! As we continue to work together, we'll introduce more CBT techniques that can help you manage your depression and anger. One technique we'll practice today is thought recording, which involves writing down your negative thoughts, identifying the cognitive distortions, and challenging them with evidence and alternative perspectives. This can help you start to change your thought patterns over time.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'm familiar with thought records from my homework. How do we practice it in session?\n\nTherapist: Let's start by identifying a recent situation where you felt depressed or frustrated. Can you think of an example from the past week?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I got really frustrated with myself the other day when I couldn't focus on my readings for class. I kept thinking, \"I'm so behind, I'll never catch up,\" and \"I'm a failure as a student.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Noor. Those thoughts sound very distressing. Let's write them down in a thought record. The first column is for the situation, which is \"trying to read for class.\" The second column is for your emotions, which are frustration and depression. The third column is for your negative thoughts, which are \"I'm so behind, I'll never catch up,\" and \"I'm a failure as a student.\" Now, let's identify the cognitive distortions in those thoughts. Do you notice any all-or-nothing thinking?\n\nPatient: Yes, saying \"I'll never catch up\" and \"I'm a failure as a student\" are both examples of all-or-nothing thinking. I'm jumping to the worst-case scenario instead of looking at the situation realistically.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Now, let's challenge those thoughts by looking at the evidence. Have there been times in the past when you've been able to catch up on your work, even if you felt behind?\n\nPatient: Well, last semester I fell behind on a project, but I was able to put in extra work and get it done before the deadline. So I guess there is evidence that I can catch up when I need to.",
