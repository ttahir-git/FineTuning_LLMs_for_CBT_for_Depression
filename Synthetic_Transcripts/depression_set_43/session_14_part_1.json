  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'd love to hear how you've been doing since our last session. Can you share with me how your mood has been and if there have been any significant changes or experiences?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the thought records and positive data log. It's been challenging at times, but I do notice a slight improvement in my mood when I actively engage in these exercises. However, I still find myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns, especially when it comes to my studies and feeling like I'm not meeting expectations.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvement in your mood, even if it's slight. It's completely normal to still experience negative thought patterns, especially when it comes to areas of your life that are important to you, like your studies. Today, I'd like to focus on exploring those negative thoughts further and work on reframing them in a more balanced way. We can also discuss any challenges you've faced with the positive data log and self-compassion practices. How does that sound for our agenda today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I definitely want to dive deeper into those negative thoughts and work on reframing them. I'm also struggling with the self-compassion practices, so I'd appreciate some guidance on that as well.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by exploring one of the negative thoughts you've been experiencing related to your studies. Can you share a specific situation that triggered this thought and the emotion you felt?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just last week, I received feedback on a paper I submitted for one of my courses. The feedback was mostly positive, but there were a few critical points that really stuck with me. I started thinking, \"I'm not good enough to be in this program. I'll never meet the expectations of my professors.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Noor. I can understand how receiving critical feedback can trigger negative thoughts and emotions, especially when it taps into a core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" Let's explore this further using the downward arrow technique. If the thought \"I'm not good enough to be in this program\" were true, what would that mean to you?",
