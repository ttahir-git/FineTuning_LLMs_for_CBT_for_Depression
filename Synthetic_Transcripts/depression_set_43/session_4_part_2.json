  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that triggered strong emotions for me was when I received feedback on a paper I wrote for my PhD program. The professor's comments were mostly critical, and I felt like all the effort I put into the paper was wasted.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a challenging situation, Noor. Let's take a closer look at the thought record you completed for this event. Can you walk me through the different columns and what you wrote for each one?\n\nPatient: Sure. For the situation, I wrote \"Received critical feedback on my paper.\" My emotions were frustration, disappointment, and anger, all at around an 8 out of 10 intensity. The automatic thought I identified was \"I'm not good enough to be in this program, and I'll never succeed.\"\n\nTherapist: You did a great job capturing the situation, your emotions, and the automatic thought. What did you write in the evidence for and against the thought?\n\nPatient: For evidence for the thought, I wrote \"The professor's comments were mostly negative\" and \"I struggled to understand the material.\" For evidence against the thought, I had a harder time coming up with something. I eventually wrote \"I have succeeded in other courses before\" and \"One paper doesn't define my entire academic career.\"\n\nTherapist: It's common to have difficulty identifying evidence against negative thoughts, especially when emotions are running high. You did well in coming up with a couple of points, though. What was the alternative thought you came up with?\n\nPatient: I wrote \"One paper doesn't determine my overall success in the program. I can learn from the feedback and improve in the future.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Noor. It acknowledges the validity of your feelings while also recognizing that this one experience doesn't define your entire academic journey. Did you notice any change in your emotions after coming up with this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I did feel a little better, maybe the intensity went down to a 6 out of 10. But it's still hard to shake the feeling that I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. Challenging deeply held beliefs takes time and practice. I'm glad to hear that the intensity of your emotions decreased somewhat after completing the thought record. This is a skill you can continue to use and refine as we work together.\n\nPatient: I'm willing to keep trying, but I'm not always sure if I'm identifying the right automatic thoughts or coming up with the best alternative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Noor. As we review your thought records together, we can work on fine-tuning those skills. It's also important to remember that there isn't always one \"right\" answer when it comes to identifying and challenging thoughts. The goal is to develop more balanced and helpful ways of thinking that support your well-being.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I just want to make sure I'm doing it correctly so that I can get the most out of this process.\n\nTherapist: Your commitment to the process is admirable, Noor. As we continue to work together, you'll likely find that it becomes easier to identify and challenge your thoughts. And remember, I'm here to support you and provide guidance along the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you. I appreciate your support and encouragement.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about behavioral activation. You mentioned earlier that you struggled to find the motivation to follow through with the activities you planned. Can you tell me more about what got in the way?",
