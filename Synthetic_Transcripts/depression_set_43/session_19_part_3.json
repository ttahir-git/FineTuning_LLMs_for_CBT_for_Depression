  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying to add to the Positive Data Log, but it's been a bit challenging. I've added a few things, like when I received a good grade on a paper or when a friend complimented me on my artwork. But it's still hard to shake the feeling that I'm not doing enough.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that it can be challenging to gather evidence for your new balanced core belief, especially when you've been struggling with perfectionism and feelings of inadequacy for a long time. The fact that you've been able to add some examples to your Positive Data Log is a significant step in the right direction.\n\nLet's explore one of the examples you mentioned, like receiving a good grade on a paper. What thoughts and feelings came up for you when you received that positive feedback?\n\nPatient: When I got the good grade, I felt a mix of things. I was happy and proud of myself for doing well, but I also had thoughts like, \"I could have done better\" or \"This doesn't really count because it was an easy assignment.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Noor. It's common to have mixed thoughts and feelings in response to positive experiences, especially when you're working on challenging long-standing negative beliefs. The thoughts you mentioned, like \"I could have done better\" or \"This doesn't really count,\" are examples of cognitive distortions, specifically disqualifying the positive and minimizing your achievements.\n\nLet's take a moment to examine those thoughts more closely. When you think, \"I could have done better,\" what impact does that have on your feelings and behavior?\n\nPatient: When I think that way, it makes me feel like I'm never doing enough, even when I do well. It takes away from the accomplishment and makes me feel like I always have to be perfect.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. That thought, \"I could have done better,\" can lead to feelings of inadequacy and pressure to be perfect, even in the face of clear evidence of your success, like getting a good grade. This is a great opportunity to practice challenging that thought using some of the CBT skills we've been working on.\n\nOne way to challenge that thought is to consider the evidence for and against it. What evidence do you have that you could have done better, and what evidence do you have that you did well on the assignment?\n\nPatient: The evidence that I could have done better is mostly just my own perfectionistic standards. I always feel like I could do more, even when I've put in a lot of effort. The evidence that I did well is the good grade I received and the positive feedback from my professor.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent analysis, Noor. You've identified that the evidence for the thought \"I could have done better\" is based on your perfectionistic standards, which we know are often unrealistic and unhelpful. On the other hand, you have concrete evidence that you did well on the assignment, like the good grade and positive feedback.\n\nAnother way to challenge that thought is to consider what you would say to a friend who expressed a similar thought after receiving a good grade. What advice would you give them?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them to be proud of themselves and to celebrate their success. I would remind them that they worked hard and that their effort paid off.\n\nTherapist: That's a great perspective, Noor. It's often easier to be compassionate and understanding with others than it is with ourselves. By considering what you would say to a friend, you can start to develop more self-compassion and challenge those perfectionistic thoughts.\n\nLet's try applying that same logic to your own situation. What would it look like to be proud of yourself and celebrate your success, even if it wasn't perfect?\n\nPatient: I guess it would look like acknowledging the effort I put in and being satisfied with the good grade, even if it's not a perfect score. It would mean focusing on the positive feedback and allowing myself to feel good about my work.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By acknowledging your effort, focusing on the positive feedback, and allowing yourself to feel good about your work, you're challenging those perfectionistic thoughts and building self-compassion. This is a great example of how you can use your CBT skills to shift your thoughts and feelings in a more balanced and realistic direction.\n\nAs we continue to work on challenging perfectionism and building self-compassion, it's essential to practice these skills regularly, even when it feels challenging. The more you practice, the more natural it will become to challenge those negative thoughts and focus on the evidence that supports your new balanced core belief.\n\nI'm curious, how do you feel about continuing to add to your Positive Data Log and practicing these skills, even when it feels difficult?",
