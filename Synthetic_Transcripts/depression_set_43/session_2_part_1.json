  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Noor, it's great to see you again for our second session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate, and I want to encourage you to fact-check anything that doesn't seem quite right. Lastly, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel that you're in crisis or need immediate support, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted person in your life.\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. I'm here because I want to work on managing my depression and improving my overall well-being.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, and I'm here to support you in that journey. Before we continue, let's set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to start by reviewing the homework you did over the past week, discussing the thought records you kept. Then, we can begin exploring the CBT framework and how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors might be interconnected. We'll also start identifying some of your specific thought patterns related to your depression. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm curious to learn more about the CBT framework and how it can help me.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your thought records. Can you share some of the situations that triggered strong emotions or negative thoughts for you over the past week?",
