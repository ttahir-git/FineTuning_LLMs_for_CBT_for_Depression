  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you've been struggling with feelings of hopelessness and exhaustion that make it hard to engage in activities that you know are good for you. Let's explore that a bit more. Can you give me an example of a time recently when you felt that way?\n\nPatient: Sure, just the other day I had plans to meet up with a friend for coffee. I was really looking forward to it, but when the time came to get ready and go, I just felt so tired and hopeless. I started thinking, \"What's the point? I'm just going to be miserable anyway.\" And I ended up canceling at the last minute.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so in that moment, the thoughts \"What's the point?\" and \"I'm just going to be miserable anyway\" led to feelings of hopelessness and exhaustion, which led to the behavior of canceling your plans. Is that right?\n\nPatient: Yeah, that's exactly it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great catch. So let's look at that thought, \"I'm just going to be miserable anyway.\" What would you say is the evidence for and against that thought?\n\nPatient: Well, the evidence for it is that I've been feeling pretty miserable in general lately. And sometimes when I do go out with friends, I don't enjoy it as much as I used to because I'm so stuck in my own head. The evidence against it is that there have been times when getting out and socializing did help me feel a bit better, even if it was just temporary. And my friend always makes me laugh, so there was a good chance I would have enjoyed it at least a little bit.\n\nTherapist: That's really good that you're able to see evidence on both sides. It's true that there's no guarantee that you would have enjoyed it, but it sounds like there was a reasonable chance that you might have, based on past experiences. What do you think would have happened if you had challenged that thought in the moment and decided to go anyway, even if you weren't sure you'd enjoy it?\n\nPatient: I guess I might have ended up having a decent time. And even if I didn't, at least I would have known I tried instead of just assuming the worst and giving up.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Challenging those hopeless thoughts doesn't mean you'll always feel better, but it gives you a chance to test out whether they're true instead of just assuming they are. It's a bit like doing an experiment - you have a prediction (in this case, that you'll be miserable), but you have to actually do the experiment to see if the prediction is accurate.\n\nPatient: Yeah, that makes sense. I guess I've just been so stuck in that negative mindset that I haven't been giving myself a chance to test out those predictions.\n\nTherapist: That's really common when you're dealing with depression. The negative thoughts can be so loud and convincing that it feels like there's no point in even trying. But every time you challenge one of those thoughts and do the experiment anyway, you're taking a step towards breaking out of that cycle.\n\nPatient: I can see that. It's just hard to remember in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, it takes a lot of practice to build that habit. One thing that can help is to plan ahead a bit - before you're in the situation, think about what kinds of negative thoughts are likely to come up and how you might challenge them. That way, when the thoughts do come up, you've already got a bit of a game plan.",
