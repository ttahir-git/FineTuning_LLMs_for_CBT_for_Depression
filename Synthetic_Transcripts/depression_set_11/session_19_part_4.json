As we wrap up today's session, I want to encourage you to keep practicing these techniques, even when it feels challenging. Remember that it's okay to take breaks and be patient with yourself.\n\nPatient: I will. It's helpful to know that I have these tools to fall back on when I'm struggling. I'm feeling more hopeful about my ability to cope with my pain and depression.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Jamie. Before we end today's session, let's take a moment to check in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also more relaxed than when we started. It's been a tough week, but I feel like I have a better handle on how to manage my symptoms now. I'm grateful for your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: It's been a pleasure working with you, Jamie. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and there may be setbacks along the way. The important thing is to keep practicing and being kind to yourself.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing paced breathing and activity pacing. Try to use these techniques at least once a day, and notice how they impact your pain and mood. I also want you to keep using \"I\" statements and active listening in your conversations with your partner and others. Pay attention to how these skills affect your relationships and overall well-being.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll make sure to practice these skills every day and take note of how they're helping me.\n\nTherapist: Great. We'll start our next session by reviewing your experience with the homework and discussing any challenges or successes you've had.
