  "transcript": "Patient: I've written down those coping statements on cards. I'll keep them with me to read when I'm feeling down about my art or myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Jamie. Having those physical reminders can be really helpful in challenging negative thoughts as they arise. Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate self-doubt completely, but to have tools to manage it when it occurs.\n\nPatient: I understand. It's about progress, not perfection.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And speaking of progress, let's shift our focus to discussing strategies for maintaining the gains you've made after our sessions end. One important aspect of relapse prevention is identifying early warning signs that your depression symptoms may be returning. What do you think some of your early warning signs might be?\n\nPatient: I think if I start isolating myself more, neglecting my art and self-care, or having frequent thoughts of worthlessness, those could be signs I'm slipping back into depression.\n\nTherapist: Those are good insights, Jamie. Being aware of those early warning signs can help you take action sooner to prevent a full relapse. Let's discuss some strategies you can use if you notice those signs. What has been most helpful for you in managing your depression symptoms during our work together?\n\nPatient: The paced breathing and activity pacing have been helpful for my chronic pain. Challenging my negative thoughts with evidence and coping statements has been useful too.\n\nTherapist: Those are great tools to continue using. It's also important to have a plan for accessing support if needed. In addition to your coping cards and CBT skills, who are the people in your life you can reach out to for help?\n\nPatient: My partner is very supportive. I could also reach out to some of my friends from my art classes.\n\nTherapist: That's good to hear. Having a strong support system is crucial. Another option to consider is joining a support group for artists or people with chronic pain and depression. That could provide an additional network of people who understand what you're going through. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: I hadn't really considered a support group before, but it could be helpful to connect with others who have similar struggles.\n\nTherapist: It's definitely something to think about. I can provide you with some resources for finding local support groups if that's something you want to explore further. Remember, building a comprehensive support system, including professional help if needed, is an important part of maintaining your progress.",
