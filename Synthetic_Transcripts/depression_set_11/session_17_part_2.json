  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your experience with the homework assignments. Can you tell me how it went with keeping a positive data log and practicing the thought records?\n\nPatient: Keeping the positive data log was challenging at first because I kept discounting the things I wrote down, telling myself they weren't really that important or valuable. But as I kept doing it, I started to see patterns and realize that I do make a difference in small ways.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Jamie. Recognizing those patterns and acknowledging your contributions, even if they feel small, is an important step in challenging those negative core beliefs about your self-worth. Did you notice any changes in your mood or thoughts as you continued with the positive data log?\n\nPatient: I think it did help a little. When I was feeling down, I would look back at the log and remind myself of those moments. It didn't always work, but it did help shift my perspective sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. Even small shifts in perspective can make a big difference over time. And it's okay if it doesn't always work \u2013 the goal is to build up those alternative thoughts and beliefs gradually. How about the thought records? How did you find that exercise?\n\nPatient: The thought records were harder for me. I struggled to identify the evidence against my negative thoughts. It felt like the negative thoughts were so loud and overwhelming that it was hard to see anything else.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Jamie. When we're in the grip of strong negative emotions, it can be difficult to see alternative perspectives. That's why we practice this skill \u2013 to train our brains to look for evidence that might not be immediately apparent. Did you manage to find any evidence against your negative thoughts, even if it felt small or insignificant?\n\nPatient: Sometimes. Like, I might think that I'm not a real artist because my work isn't perfect, but then I remember that even famous artists have flaws in their work. It's just hard to believe it in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of finding evidence against a negative thought, Jamie. And you're right, even famous artists have flaws and imperfections in their work. In fact, those imperfections are often what makes their work unique and relatable. \n\nOne technique that can be helpful when you're struggling to find evidence against a negative thought is to imagine what you would say to a friend in a similar situation. Often, we're much kinder and more objective when it comes to other people than we are with ourselves. So, if a friend told you they weren't a real artist because their work wasn't perfect, what would you say to them?\n\nPatient: I guess I would tell them that perfection is impossible and that what matters is expressing themselves and connecting with others through their art.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And that same compassion and understanding you would offer to a friend is what we're trying to cultivate towards yourself. It's a process, and it takes practice, but every time you challenge a negative thought and look for alternative evidence, you're taking a step in that direction.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to keep that in mind when I'm doing the thought records.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. And remember, it's okay if it feels difficult or if you don't always find strong evidence against the negative thoughts. The goal is to practice looking for alternatives and building up those new thought patterns over time.\n\nNow, let's talk a bit more about those moments when you're feeling hopeless and struggling to find motivation. Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind during those times?",
