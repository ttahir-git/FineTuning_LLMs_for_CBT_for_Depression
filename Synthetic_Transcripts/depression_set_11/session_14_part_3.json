  "transcript": "Patient: On those really low days, it feels like I'm trapped in this dark, heavy fog. I can't see a way out, and even the simplest tasks feel impossible. I might lay in bed for hours, just staring at the wall, or I might pace around the house, feeling restless and agitated. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of negative thoughts and feelings, and I can't break free.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like an incredibly difficult and overwhelming experience, Jamie. When you're in that dark, heavy fog, what kind of thoughts tend to run through your mind?\n\nPatient: It's a lot of self-critical thoughts, like \"I'm useless,\" \"I'll never get better,\" or \"I'm just a burden on everyone.\" I also have thoughts about how pointless everything seems, like \"What's the point in even trying?\" or \"Nothing matters anyway.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound very familiar \u2013 they're the same kind of negative, self-defeating thoughts we've been working on challenging throughout our sessions. When you're in that low place, it can be hard to access the skills and insights you've been developing. That's why having a plan in place for those difficult moments can be so helpful.\n\nOne strategy we can use is called a \"Coping Card.\" A Coping Card is a small, easily accessible reminder of the skills and insights you've learned in therapy. It can include things like positive self-statements, reminders of your strengths and supports, or specific coping strategies that have worked for you in the past.\n\nFor example, your Coping Card might say something like, \"I am resilient and capable of overcoming challenges. I have support from my partner and friends. I can use deep breathing to calm my body and mind. This feeling will pass, and I will be okay.\"\n\nWhat do you think about creating a Coping Card for yourself, Jamie? We can work on it together and tailor it to your specific needs and preferences.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good idea. I like the idea of having something tangible to remind me of the things we've been working on. It's hard to remember all of that when I'm in the middle of a low period.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's the beauty of a Coping Card \u2013 it does the remembering for you when your mind is clouded by depression. Let's start brainstorming some ideas for your card. What are some of the most helpful insights or skills you've learned in therapy so far?\n\nPatient: Well, I think the idea of embracing imperfection has been really powerful for me. And the thought records have helped me start to challenge some of those negative thoughts. Oh, and the deep breathing exercises have been good for calming me down when I'm feeling really overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: Those are all great examples, Jamie. Let's write those down, along with some positive self-statements and reminders of your supports. We can also include a list of small, manageable activities that you can do even when you're feeling low, like taking a short walk, listening to music, or drawing for a few minutes.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't to \"fix\" the low feelings or make them go away completely \u2013 that's not always possible. The goal is to help you ride out the wave of emotion without getting pulled under by it. Your Coping Card can be like a life raft, helping you stay afloat until the wave passes.\n\nPatient: I like that analogy. It feels less overwhelming to think about it that way. I don't have to make the feelings go away, I just have to get through them.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Jamie. You've already shown so much strength and resilience in getting through difficult times. Your Coping Card will just be another tool in your toolbox, reminding you of the skills and supports you already have.\n\nLet's spend some time now creating your card. We can write it out together, and then you can take a picture of it with your phone or write it out on a small notecard to keep with you. That way, you'll have it handy whenever you need it.\n\nPatient: Okay, let's do it. I'm ready to add another tool to my toolbox.",
