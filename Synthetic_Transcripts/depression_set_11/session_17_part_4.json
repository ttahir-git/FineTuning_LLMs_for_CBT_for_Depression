  "transcript": "Patient: When I'm feeling hopeless, I just keep thinking that nothing will ever change, that I'll always feel this way. It's like I'm stuck in this dark hole and I can't see a way out.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a really painful and scary place to be, Jamie. Those thoughts of hopelessness can be all-consuming and make it feel like there's no possibility for change. But I want to remind you that those thoughts are not facts \u2013 they're a product of your depression, not a reflection of reality.\n\nOne technique that can be helpful in those moments is to practice grounding yourself in the present moment. Instead of getting caught up in the thoughts about the future, try to focus on your immediate surroundings and sensations. You can do this by noticing five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can help bring you back to the present and create some distance from those overwhelming thoughts.\n\nPatient: I've tried something like that before, but it's hard to remember to do it in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Jamie. It can be challenging to remember to use coping skills when we're feeling overwhelmed. One way to make it easier is to create a physical reminder, like a Coping Card. You can write down the grounding technique, along with other coping skills that have been helpful for you, on a small card that you can carry with you. That way, when you're feeling hopeless, you have a tangible reminder of the tools you can use to cope.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I can keep it in my wallet or pocket so I always have it with me.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And remember, the goal isn't to get rid of the hopeless thoughts completely \u2013 that's not always possible. The goal is to create some space between you and the thoughts, so they don't feel as all-consuming. Even a small shift in perspective can make a big difference in how you feel.\n\nAnother technique that can be helpful is to practice self-compassion. When you're feeling hopeless, it's easy to get caught up in self-criticism and blame. But treating yourself with kindness and understanding can help ease some of that emotional pain.\n\nOne way to practice self-compassion is to imagine what you would say to a friend who was feeling the way you are. What kind of support and encouragement would you offer them? Try to extend that same compassion and understanding to yourself.\n\nPatient: I guess I would tell a friend that it's okay to feel this way, that everyone struggles sometimes. And that even if it feels hopeless now, it won't always feel this way.\n\nTherapist: That's a beautiful example of self-compassion, Jamie. And that same message applies to you \u2013 it's okay to feel hopeless sometimes, and even if it feels like it will last forever, it won't. You've gotten through difficult times before, and you will get through this too.\n\nAs we wrap up our session today, I want to acknowledge the hard work you've been doing, Jamie. Challenging negative thoughts and beliefs is not easy, but you've been showing up and engaging in the process, even when it's difficult. That takes a lot of courage and strength.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue with the positive data log and thought records. I'd also like you to create a Coping Card with the grounding technique and other coping skills that have been helpful for you. And finally, I'd like you to practice extending self-compassion to yourself, especially in moments when you're feeling hopeless or self-critical.\n\nHow does that feel for you? Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?\n\nPatient: No, I think I understand. It's just a lot to remember to do sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, Jamie. It can feel overwhelming to try to incorporate all of these new skills and techniques into your daily life. Remember, it's okay to start small and build up gradually. Even practicing one technique, like the grounding exercise, can make a difference.\n\nAnd if you find yourself struggling to remember or motivate yourself to do the homework, that's okay too. That's information we can use in our next session to problem-solve and come up with strategies to make it feel more manageable.\n\nI'm here to support you every step of the way, Jamie. We'll keep working together to find the tools and techniques that work best for you.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. I'm glad I can be here to support you. Before we end our session, let's take a moment to check in on how you're feeling now. What's your mood like after our conversation today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a little better. It's helpful to have some specific tools to try when I'm feeling hopeless. And it's good to be reminded that those thoughts aren't necessarily true.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Jamie. It's great that you're feeling a little better and that you've found some tools that feel helpful. Remember, even small shifts in mood and perspective are significant and meaningful.\n\nIf you find yourself struggling between now and our next session, don't hesitate to reach out for support. You can always contact me, or reach out to your partner or a trusted friend. You don't have to go through this alone.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I'll keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Jamie. I look forward to seeing you again for our next session. Until then, take care of yourself and remember to practice self-compassion.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Reviewing homework assignments (positive data log and thought records), exploring thoughts and feelings related to hopelessness, developing coping strategies for managing overwhelming thoughts and feelings, practicing self-compassion\n- Techniques or exercises used: Positive data log, thought records, grounding technique, Coping Card, self-compassion\n- Homework assigned: Continue with positive data log and thought records, create a Coping Card with grounding technique and other helpful coping skills, practice extending self-compassion to oneself, especially in moments of hopelessness or self-criticism\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details: Jamie has been engaging with homework assignments and finding some benefit, particularly with the positive data log.
