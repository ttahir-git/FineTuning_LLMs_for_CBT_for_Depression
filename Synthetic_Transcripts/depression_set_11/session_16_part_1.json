  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Jamie, it's great to see you again for our 16th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a crisis situation, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted support person in your life. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret your non-verbal cues, so I'll be relying on your descriptions of your thoughts and feelings. With all that said, how have you been since our last session? I'm interested to hear about your experience with the coping strategies we discussed, particularly the grounding technique.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been trying to use the Coping Card and the grounding technique when I'm feeling overwhelmed. The grounding technique has been helpful in anchoring me in the present moment when my thoughts start to spiral. However, I've still been struggling with negative thoughts related to my artistic identity and perfectionism. It's been challenging to generate evidence against these thoughts, even though I know they're not entirely rational.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the grounding technique has been helpful for you in managing overwhelming emotions. It's a great tool to have in your coping skills toolbox. Regarding the negative thoughts about your artistic identity and perfectionism, it's understandable that challenging these deeply held beliefs can be difficult. Would you like to spend some time today exploring these thoughts further and perhaps work on generating some evidence against them?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that would be really helpful. I've been feeling stuck in this negative thought pattern, and I'm not sure how to break out of it.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's add that to our agenda for today. We can start by identifying some of the specific negative thoughts you've been having and then work on generating evidence against them using a thought record. We can also discuss some additional coping strategies for managing overwhelming thoughts and feelings, such as progressive muscle relaxation or deep breathing exercises. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm also wondering if we could talk about strategies for maintaining progress and managing setbacks. I've been feeling a bit discouraged lately, and I'm worried about losing the progress I've made.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's a great topic to add to our agenda. It's normal to experience setbacks and plateaus in the therapeutic process, but there are strategies we can use to maintain momentum and cope with challenges. We can also discuss how to recognize and celebrate small victories along the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, that makes me feel more hopeful. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's dive in. To start, can you tell me about a specific negative thought you've been having related to your artistic identity or perfectionism? We'll use this as an example to practice generating evidence against the thought.",
