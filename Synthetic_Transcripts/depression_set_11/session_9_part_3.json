  "transcript": "Patient: If it were true that I'll never create anything worthwhile again, I guess it would mean that I've lost a huge part of myself. Art has always been my passion and my outlet. Without it, I'm not sure who I am or what my purpose is.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Jamie. It sounds like art is deeply connected to your sense of identity and purpose. Let's keep going with this. If you felt like you lost a huge part of yourself and your purpose, what would that mean about you or your life?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm just empty and adrift, you know? Like I'm not really contributing anything meaningful anymore. And if I can't create, then what's the point of even being here?\n\nTherapist: I hear you, Jamie. These thoughts about losing your sense of self and purpose are incredibly painful. It sounds like there might be some deeper beliefs at play here, perhaps about your worth being tied to your ability to create art. Does that resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think so. I've always put so much of myself into my art. It's like my value as a person is wrapped up in what I can create.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common belief among artists and creative people, but it can also be a heavy burden to carry. Let's explore this a bit more. What do you think about the idea that your worth as a person is separate from your ability to create art?\n\nPatient: I mean, logically I know that I have value beyond my art. But it's hard to really feel that, you know?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, it can be really difficult to internalize that separation between self-worth and creative output. Let's look at some evidence for the idea that your worth is separate from your art. What are some other aspects of yourself or your life that give you a sense of value or purpose?\n\nPatient: Well, I know my partner loves me for more than just my art. And I've always tried to be a good friend and family member, even when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: Those are really important points, Jamie. Your relationships and the care you show for others are significant sources of worth and meaning. Let's keep building on this. What about your other qualities, like your resilience, your empathy, or your sense of humor?\n\nPatient: I guess those things are part of who I am too, even if they're not as tangible as a piece of art.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Those intangible qualities are just as much a part of your worth as your creative abilities. Let's try to reframe that core belief a bit. Instead of \"My worth is tied to my ability to create art,\" what if we tried something like \"My worth is made up of many different qualities, including but not limited to my creativity\"?\n\nPatient: That feels a little more balanced. It's going to take some practice to really believe it, but I can see how that perspective could help.\n\nTherapist: You're right, shifting those deep-seated beliefs takes time and practice. But even starting to recognize them and question their validity is a huge step. As we continue with our work together, we can keep gathering evidence for this new, more balanced belief.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It feels less all-or-nothing, you know?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! And speaking of all-or-nothing thinking, I'm curious if you noticed any other cognitive distortions coming up in your thought records this week.",
