Let's explore this thought further using a thought record. First, can you tell me about a specific situation or trigger that led to this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I was working on a painting the other day, and I just couldn't get the colors to blend the way I wanted them to. I got frustrated and started thinking that I'm not good enough and that my work will never be perfect.\n\nTherapist: I understand how frustrating that must have been for you. Let's write that down as the situation or trigger. Now, what emotions did you experience in that moment, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt really discouraged and hopeless, like an 80 out of 100. I also felt angry at myself for not being able to get it right.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write those emotions down, along with their intensity. Now, can you identify the most prominent automatic thought that went through your mind in that moment?\n\nPatient: The thought that stood out the most was \"I'm not a real artist because my work isn't perfect.\"\n\nTherapist: Great, let's write that down as the automatic thought. Now, let's look for evidence that supports this thought. What makes you believe that it's true?\n\nPatient: Well, I see other artists whose work is so much better than mine. They seem to have it all figured out, and their work is flawless. I feel like I'll never be able to create something that perfect.\n\nTherapist: I hear you. Let's write that down as evidence for the thought. Now, let's look for evidence against the thought. What would you say to a friend who expressed a similar belief about their own work?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that perfection is subjective and that everyone has their own unique style. I'd remind them that art is about self-expression, not perfection.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Jamie. Let's write that down as evidence against the thought. Can you think of any other evidence against the belief that you're not a real artist because your work isn't perfect?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I've had people tell me they like my work before, even if I didn't think it was perfect. And I do enjoy the process of creating, even if the end result isn't always what I envisioned.\n\nTherapist: Those are both excellent points. Let's write those down as well. Now, based on the evidence for and against the thought, can you come up with an alternative thought that feels more balanced and realistic?\n\nPatient: I suppose an alternative thought could be \"I am an artist because I create art and express myself, regardless of whether it's perfect.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Jamie. Let's write that down. Now, thinking about this alternative thought, how intense are the emotions of discouragement and anger now, on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: They're still there, but not as intense. Maybe around a 50 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: That's progress! Let's write that down as the outcome. This is a great example of how challenging our negative thoughts and looking for evidence against them can help shift our perspective and reduce the intensity of our emotions.\n\nPatient: I can see how this could be helpful. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Jamie. It takes practice to make this kind of thought challenging a habit. One thing that can help is to set aside a specific time each day to review your thoughts and look for evidence against the negative ones. You can also try setting a reminder on your phone or putting up sticky notes around your workspace to prompt you to challenge your thoughts when you're feeling stuck.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I'll try setting a reminder on my phone and see if that helps me remember to do this more often.",
