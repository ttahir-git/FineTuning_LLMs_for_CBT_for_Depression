  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your experiences with the creative activities and motivation since our last session. Can you tell me more about the times when you were able to engage in sketching and painting? What was that experience like for you?\n\nPatient: It felt really good to be able to express myself creatively again. When I'm in the flow of sketching or painting, I feel like I'm in a different world. It's like a temporary escape from my depression. But it's hard to hold onto that feeling when I'm done. The negative thoughts start creeping in, telling me that my work isn't good enough, that I'm not a real artist.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you were able to find some moments of relief and expression through your art. It's not uncommon for negative thoughts to arise after engaging in an activity that we care about. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. Can you give me an example of a specific negative thought that came up after you finished sketching or painting?\n\nPatient: Well, I remember after finishing a sketch the other day, I looked at it and thought, \"This is garbage. I used to be so much better at this. I'll never be able to create anything meaningful again.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that. That thought sounds like it was quite distressing. Let's examine it using a thought record. First, can you tell me what emotions you felt when you had that thought?\n\nPatient: I felt really discouraged and hopeless. It made me want to just give up on art altogether.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why you would feel that way. Let's rate the intensity of those emotions on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the most intense. How intense were the feelings of discouragement and hopelessness?\n\nPatient: I'd say the discouragement was around an 80, and the hopelessness was about a 90.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write that down. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"This is garbage. I used to be so much better at this. I'll never be able to create anything meaningful again.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, my skills aren't as sharp as they used to be. I can see that my lines aren't as clean, and my shading isn't as smooth. And I haven't been able to complete a piece that I'm really proud of in a long time.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have that goes against this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess I have to remember that I haven't been practicing as much lately because of my depression. And even if my skills aren't where they used to be, that doesn't mean I can't improve with practice. I've created meaningful pieces in the past, so there's no reason I can't do it again in the future.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. It sounds like you're able to recognize that your current skill level is not a permanent state, and that with practice and persistence, you can continue to grow and create meaningful art. Let's write that down as evidence against the negative thought.\n\nNow, based on the evidence for and against the thought, let's come up with an alternative thought that is more balanced and realistic. What do you think would be a more helpful way to view this situation?\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought would be, \"I may not be where I want to be with my art right now, but that doesn't mean I can't get there with practice and persistence. My skills can improve, and I am capable of creating meaningful work.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. Let's write that down. Now, with this new perspective in mind, let's re-rate the intensity of the emotions you felt before - discouragement and hopelessness. How intense are those feelings now?\n\nPatient: The discouragement feels more like a 50 now, and the hopelessness is around a 60. It still feels challenging, but not as overwhelming as before.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in intensity. This is a great example of how examining our thoughts and coming up with more balanced alternatives can help us manage our emotions more effectively.\n\nLet's continue to practice this skill with other negative thoughts that come up, both related to your art and other areas of your life. The more you practice, the more natural it will become to challenge those thoughts and find more helpful perspectives.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll keep working on it.\n\nTherapist: Great. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay if it feels challenging at times. The important thing is that you keep practicing and don't give up.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and talk about the conversation you had with your partner about your depression. How did that go?",
