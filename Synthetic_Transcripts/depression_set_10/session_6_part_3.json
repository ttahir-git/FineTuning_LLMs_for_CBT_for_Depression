  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you reminding me to start small and be kind to myself. It's easy for me to get overwhelmed and feel like I'm not making enough progress, but I know that small steps can lead to big changes over time.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Ash. It's great that you're able to recognize the importance of starting small and being self-compassionate. Those are key skills in managing depression and building a more fulfilling life.\n\nI want to circle back to something you mentioned earlier about feeling overwhelmed by your emotions. In addition to the thought records and self-compassion phrases we've discussed, there are some other distress tolerance techniques that can be helpful in those moments.\n\nOne technique is called \"radical acceptance.\" It involves accepting the reality of a situation, even if you don't like it or agree with it, and letting go of the struggle against it. This doesn't mean giving up or approving of the situation, but rather acknowledging that it is what it is and focusing your energy on what you can control.\n\nFor example, if you're feeling overwhelmed by sadness and hopelessness, you could practice radically accepting those emotions in the moment, rather than fighting against them or getting caught up in thoughts about how you shouldn't be feeling that way.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I often get caught up in thinking that I shouldn't be feeling a certain way, which just makes me feel worse.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Radical acceptance can help break that cycle and allow you to cope with difficult emotions in a more effective way. It's a skill that takes practice, but it can be really powerful.\n\nAnother distress tolerance technique is called \"self-soothing.\" This involves engaging in activities that are comforting and soothing to your senses, such as taking a warm bath, listening to calming music, or smelling a pleasant scent.\n\nThe idea is to provide yourself with some relief and comfort in the moment, even if you can't change the situation or emotion itself. It's a way of taking care of yourself and showing yourself kindness when you're struggling.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of self-soothing. I can think of a few activities that usually help me feel a little better, like taking a walk in nature or cuddling with my pet.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of self-soothing activities. The key is to have a few go-to options that you know work for you, so that you can easily turn to them when you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nI want to emphasize that these distress tolerance techniques are not meant to be long-term solutions, but rather short-term coping strategies to help you get through difficult moments. The goal is to use them to manage your emotions enough that you can then engage in other CBT skills, like thought records or behavioral activation, to address the underlying issues.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's kind of like putting a bandaid on a wound - it doesn't heal the wound itself, but it helps protect it and make it more manageable until it can heal.\n\nTherapist: That's a great analogy! Distress tolerance techniques are like emotional bandaids - they provide some relief and protection in the moment, but the real healing comes from the other CBT work we're doing.\n\nI'd like to spend some time now practicing one of these techniques together. Let's try radical acceptance. Can you think of a recent situation where you felt overwhelmed by your emotions and could have used this skill?\n\nPatient: Yeah, just the other day I was feeling really sad and hopeless about my job situation. I got caught up in thoughts like \"I'll never find a job I love\" and \"I'm going to be stuck in this rut forever.\"",
