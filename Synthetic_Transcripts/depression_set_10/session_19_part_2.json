  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda looks good to me. I'm particularly interested in discussing the negative thoughts related to my job search and feelings of worthlessness. I feel like those have been the most challenging for me to manage lately.\n\nTherapist: I understand that those negative thoughts have been a significant challenge for you recently. Before we dive into that, let's review your progress on the homework assignments from our last session. How has the implementation of the problem-solving plan for your sleep difficulties been going?\n\nPatient: It's been a bit of a mixed bag. I've been trying to stick to the wind-down routine we discussed, including the 5-4-3-2-1 mindfulness exercise before bed. Some nights it works well, and I'm able to fall asleep more easily. But other nights, my mind just won't seem to shut off, and I end up lying awake for hours.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience some variability in the effectiveness of these strategies, especially when you're first starting to implement them. Can you tell me more about the nights when your mind won't seem to shut off? What thoughts or concerns tend to keep you awake?\n\nPatient: It's usually a combination of things. I might start worrying about my job situation or my relationship with my partner. Sometimes I'll replay conversations or events from the day in my head, picking apart everything I said or did wrong. It's like I can't escape my own thoughts, no matter how hard I try.\n\nTherapist: That sounds incredibly frustrating and exhausting. I want to acknowledge the effort you've been putting into trying these new strategies, even when it's difficult. When you find yourself caught in those negative thought patterns at night, have you been able to use the designated worry time or thought records to help manage them?\n\nPatient: I've tried, but it's been challenging. Sometimes I'll get up and write down my worries or try to challenge the negative thoughts, but it's hard to do that when I'm feeling so overwhelmed and exhausted. I worry that I'm not doing it right or that it's not working because I'm still struggling.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel frustrated when you're putting in the effort and not seeing the results you hoped for. Remember that these skills take time and practice to develop, and it's okay if they don't work perfectly every time. Let's explore some of the specific negative thoughts you've been having related to your job search and feelings of worthlessness, and see if we can find some alternative perspectives together.",
