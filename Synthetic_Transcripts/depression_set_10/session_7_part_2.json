  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that triggered feelings of guilt and inadequacy was when I couldn't bring myself to apply for a job that my partner mentioned might be a good fit for me. I just felt so overwhelmed and anxious about the whole process that I couldn't even start the application.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Ash. Let's break this down using a thought record. Can you walk me through the situation, your emotions, and the automatic thoughts that came up?\n\nPatient: Sure. The situation was my partner mentioning the job and me not applying. My emotions were guilt, inadequacy, and anxiety. My automatic thoughts were \"I'm letting my partner down by not even trying,\" \"I'm never going to find a job if I can't even apply,\" and \"I'm a failure.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Ash. I can understand how those thoughts would lead to feelings of guilt and inadequacy. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you're letting your partner down or that you're a failure?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the evidence for those thoughts is that I didn't apply for the job, and my partner seemed disappointed. But the evidence against those thoughts is that my partner has been supportive overall, and I have had successes in the past, even if I'm struggling now.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you're able to recognize evidence against those negative thoughts. It shows that there's more to the story than just the negative perspective. Based on that evidence, how could you reframe those thoughts in a more balanced way?\n\nPatient: I could say something like, \"I'm struggling with the job search right now, but that doesn't mean I'm a failure. My partner cares about me and wants me to succeed, even if they feel disappointed sometimes.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Ash. It acknowledges the challenges you're facing while also recognizing your past successes and your partner's overall support. How does that reframe feel compared to the original thoughts?\n\nPatient: It feels more hopeful and less overwhelming. I still feel some guilt and anxiety, but it doesn't feel as all-consuming.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Ash. Reframing our thoughts can help us manage our emotions and feel more balanced. It's a skill that takes practice, but it can make a big difference in how we feel and how we approach challenges.\n\nPatient: I can see that. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Ash. That's why we practice these skills regularly, so they become more automatic over time. One thing that can help is to have some go-to self-compassion phrases or coping statements that you can use when you're feeling overwhelmed. For example, you could say something like, \"I'm doing the best I can right now,\" or \"It's okay to take things one step at a time.\" What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. Having some go-to phrases could help me shift my perspective in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Definitely. And we can work on developing those phrases together. Another thing that can help with managing overwhelming emotions is to practice distress tolerance techniques, like the ones we've been working on. In addition to radical acceptance, another technique we can try is progressive muscle relaxation. This involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in the body to help release tension and promote relaxation. Would you like to give it a try?\n\nPatient: Sure, I'm open to trying it.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's start by getting comfortable in your seat. Take a few deep breaths and try to focus on the present moment. Now, let's start with your feet. Tense the muscles in your feet by curling your toes and holding for a few seconds. Then, release the tension and let your feet relax. Notice the sensation of relaxation in your feet. Now, move up to your calves. Tense the muscles in your calves by pointing your toes and holding for a few seconds. Then, release the tension and let your calves relax. Notice the sensation of relaxation in your calves. We can continue this process with different muscle groups throughout the body, such as the thighs, buttocks, stomach, chest, arms, hands, neck, and face. The key is to focus on the contrast between the tension and relaxation and to notice the sensations in each muscle group. What do you think about this technique, Ash?\n\nPatient: It feels a bit strange to intentionally tense my muscles, but I can see how it could help me focus on relaxation. I'm willing to give it a try and see if it helps with managing my overwhelming emotions.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Ash. Like any new skill, it might feel a bit awkward at first, but with practice, it can become a helpful tool for managing stress and anxiety. I encourage you to practice progressive muscle relaxation at home, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed. You can start with just a few muscle groups and work your way up to a full-body relaxation. Remember to breathe deeply and focus on the sensations of relaxation in each muscle group.",
