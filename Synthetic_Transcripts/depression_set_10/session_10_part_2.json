  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying to think of evidence that challenges my core belief, but it's been difficult. I keep coming back to experiences that seem to confirm it, like the job rejection and the struggles in my relationship.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that those experiences feel like confirmation of your core belief, Ash. Challenging deeply held beliefs can be a gradual process, and it's okay if it takes time to gather evidence against them. Let's start by looking at the job rejection. While it's disappointing, does that single experience necessarily mean you're fundamentally flawed and unlovable?\n\nPatient: I guess not. It could just mean that I wasn't the right fit for that particular job, or that there were other qualified candidates.\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative perspective, Ash. It's important to remember that a single experience or setback doesn't define your entire worth or value as a person. Now, let's consider your relationship. Have there been times when your partner has expressed love, support, or appreciation for you, even in the midst of challenges?\n\nPatient: Yes, my partner has been very supportive and understanding, even when we've gone through rough patches. They've told me that they love me and that they're committed to working through our issues together.\n\nTherapist: That's significant, Ash. Your partner's love and support can be powerful evidence against the belief that you're unlovable. It's also important to recognize that all relationships have challenges, and those challenges don't necessarily mean there's something fundamentally wrong with you.\n\nPatient: I see your point. It's just hard to shake that belief sometimes, especially when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable, Ash. Challenging core beliefs is a process, and it's normal to have moments where those beliefs feel particularly strong. That's why we'll continue to work on gathering evidence against this belief and developing a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself. As we do this, it can also be helpful to practice self-compassion phrases, like the ones we've discussed in previous sessions. How has that practice been going for you?\n\nPatient: It's been challenging, but I've been trying to use the phrases we came up with, like \"I'm doing the best I can\" and \"Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.\" They don't always feel completely true in the moment, but I've noticed that when I use them consistently, I start to feel a bit better over time.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Ash. Consistency is key when it comes to practicing self-compassion. It's normal for the phrases to feel a bit uncomfortable or untrue at first, but as you continue to use them, they can start to feel more authentic and believable. Remember, self-compassion is a skill that takes practice, just like any other skill. The more you do it, the more natural it will feel.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the encouragement, Nova. I'll keep working on it.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Ash. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Now, let's talk a bit about managing your mood and coping with stress. One technique that can be helpful is called \"behavioral activation.\" It involves intentionally engaging in activities that bring you a sense of pleasure, mastery, or accomplishment, even when you don't feel motivated to do them. The idea is that by engaging in these activities, you can start to boost your mood and build momentum. What are some activities that you enjoy or that give you a sense of accomplishment?",
