  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Ash, it's great to see you again for our second session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm feeling a bit low today, but I'm hoping our session will help me gain some clarity and insights.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're here, and I'm committed to working with you to better understand and manage your depression. Before we discuss your homework, let's set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review your thought record, introduce the CBT framework focusing on the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and start exploring your specific thought patterns related to your depression. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm particularly interested in learning more about the CBT framework and how it can help me.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your thought record homework. Can you share some of the negative thoughts you documented and the situations that triggered them?",
