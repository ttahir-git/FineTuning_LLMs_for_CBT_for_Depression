  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I think exploring the connection between my thoughts, feelings, and behaviors around the job search process and feelings of worthlessness is really important right now.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely focus on that. Before we dive into the job search process, let's review your progress on the homework assignments. How did you find practicing the 5-4-3-2-1 mindfulness technique since our last session?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to practice it regularly, especially when I start feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts. It has helped me ground myself and focus on the present moment. However, there have been times when I've struggled to remember to use the technique when I'm really caught up in my thoughts.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been practicing the 5-4-3-2-1 technique and finding it helpful in grounding yourself. It's also understandable that it can be challenging to remember to use the technique when you're really caught up in your thoughts. That's something we can continue to work on together. How about the positive data log? How has that been going?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to add to the positive data log every day, but it's been difficult at times. I find myself questioning the validity of the evidence I'm gathering to challenge my negative core belief. It's like there's a part of me that doesn't want to believe the positive things about myself.\n\nTherapist: It's really common to struggle with believing the positive evidence, especially when it challenges a long-held negative core belief. Our brains are wired to pay more attention to negative information, so it takes time and practice to shift that balance. The fact that you're continuing to add to the positive data log, even when it feels difficult, is a big step in the right direction. Let's look at an example from your log this week. Can you share a piece of evidence you recorded and the negative thought it challenged?\n\nPatient: Sure. I wrote down that I received a compliment from a friend on a design project I helped them with. The negative thought it challenged was \"I'm not good enough at my job.\" But even after writing it down, I found myself thinking, \"They were just being nice. It doesn't really mean anything.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Receiving a compliment on your design work is a clear piece of evidence that challenges the negative thought \"I'm not good enough at my job.\" The thought that followed, \"They were just being nice. It doesn't really mean anything,\" is a great opportunity to practice challenging cognitive distortions. This thought seems to be an example of \"discounting the positive,\" where you're minimizing the significance of the compliment. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I can see how I was discounting the positive. It's like I'm not allowing myself to fully accept the compliment and believe that I did a good job.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Challenging cognitive distortions like discounting the positive is an important part of the work we're doing together. It's about learning to recognize when our thoughts might not be entirely accurate or helpful, and then finding more balanced and realistic ways of thinking. This is something we'll continue to practice. How did you find using the thought records to challenge catastrophizing thoughts?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to use the thought records, but I've found it challenging to come up with alternative perspectives when I'm really caught up in catastrophizing. It's like my brain gets stuck on the worst-case scenario, and it's hard to see anything else.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. When we're caught up in catastrophizing, it can be really difficult to see alternative perspectives. That's why practicing generating alternatives, even when it feels hard, is so important. It's like building a muscle \u2013 the more you do it, the easier it becomes over time. Let's look at an example of a catastrophizing thought you had this week and practice generating some alternative perspectives together.",
