  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Ash, it's great to see you again for session 8. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about that. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and self-compassion phrases. It's been challenging at times, but I do feel like I'm making some progress. I've also been continuing with the behavioral activation plan and tracking my mood.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed, even though it's been challenging at times. It's great that you're noticing some progress. Can you tell me more about your experience with the thought records and self-compassion phrases? How have they been helpful, and what challenges have you faced?\n\nPatient: The thought records have been helpful in identifying and reframing some of my negative thoughts, especially around my job search and relationship. It's been challenging to remember to do them in the moment, but when I do, I notice a shift in my perspective. The self-compassion phrases have been a bit more difficult for me to connect with, but I'm trying to practice them regularly.\n\nTherapist: It's common to face challenges when learning new skills, and it's great that you're persisting with the thought records and self-compassion phrases. Remembering to use these tools in the moment can be tricky, but with practice, it becomes more natural. As for the self-compassion phrases, sometimes it can help to experiment with different phrases or reframe them in a way that feels more authentic to you. We can explore that further today if you'd like.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I think I could use some help with the self-compassion phrases. I'd also like to discuss some of the challenges I've been facing in my job search and relationship, and how I can continue to apply these skills in those areas.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely focus on those areas today. Before we set our agenda, let me check in with you about your mood and any other changes you've noticed since our last session. How would you describe your overall mood, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?",
