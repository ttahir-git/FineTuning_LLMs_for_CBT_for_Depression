  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Ash, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or significant experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like worry time and thought stopping. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some improvements in managing my rumination. However, I've also had a few rough days where I felt overwhelmed and struggled to apply the techniques consistently.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we discussed, Ash. It's completely normal to have ups and downs in the process. I'm here to support you through the challenges. Can you tell me more about the rough days you experienced? What thoughts and emotions came up for you during those times?\n\nPatient: On those rough days, I found myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns, particularly around my job search and relationship. I kept thinking that I'm not good enough and that I'll never find a fulfilling job or have a healthy relationship. It felt like a dark cloud was hanging over me, and I struggled to find the motivation to do anything.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Ash. Those negative thought patterns can be incredibly overwhelming and draining. Let's explore them further. When you have thoughts like \"I'm not good enough,\" what emotions do you experience? And how do those emotions influence your behavior?\n\nPatient: When I think \"I'm not good enough,\" I feel a mix of sadness, hopelessness, and shame. It's like a heavy weight on my chest. And when I'm feeling that way, I tend to withdraw and isolate myself. I might cancel plans with friends or avoid applying for jobs because I convince myself that it's pointless.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Ash. You've identified a clear connection between your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. This is the core of what we work on in CBT - understanding how our thoughts influence our feelings and actions. When we have negative, distorted thoughts, they can lead to intense emotions that drive unhelpful behaviors, creating a vicious cycle.\n\nGiven what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to focus on continuing to challenge those negative thoughts and core beliefs in today's session. We can also discuss strategies for managing the emotional and behavioral aspects of this cycle. What are your thoughts on that? Is there anything else you'd like to prioritize in our agenda for today?",
