  "transcript": "Patient: I've been feeling guilty because I feel like I'm not doing enough to support my partner, both emotionally and financially. I know they're struggling too, but I feel so drained by my own emotions that I don't have much to give. And the hopelessness comes from feeling like things will never change, like I'll always feel this way.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Ash. It's common for people to feel guilt when they're struggling with depression, especially in the context of relationships. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to support your partner, even though you're going through a difficult time yourself. Let's explore this further.\n\nCan you tell me about a recent situation where you felt guilty for not supporting your partner enough? Let's break it down using a thought record.\n\nPatient: Sure, I can think of an example from just last week. My partner had a really stressful day at work and was venting to me about it. I listened, but I didn't say much because I was feeling really low myself. Afterwards, I felt guilty for not being more supportive or offering advice.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's use that example to fill out a thought record together. What emotions were you feeling in that situation, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I was feeling guilty, sad, and overwhelmed. The guilt was probably around 80, the sadness around 70, and the overwhelm around 85.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for identifying those emotions. Now, what automatic thoughts were going through your mind during that situation?\n\nPatient: I was thinking \"I should be more supportive,\" \"I'm a bad partner,\" and \"My partner deserves better than me.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound very critical and self-blaming. Let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you're a bad partner?\n\nPatient: Well, I wasn't very supportive in that moment, and I've been so focused on my own struggles that I haven't been there for my partner as much as I'd like to be.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against the thought that you're a bad partner?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm still here, still trying. I listen when my partner needs to vent, even if I don't always know what to say. And I do small things to show I care, like making dinner or giving hugs.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you're able to recognize those things. It sounds like there's evidence on both sides, but the evidence against the thought that you're a bad partner is pretty strong. Based on that, what's an alternative thought you could have about yourself as a partner?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like \"I'm doing my best, even if it doesn't always feel like enough. I'm still showing up and trying to support my partner, even if it's in small ways.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and compassionate thought. How do you think your emotions would change if you had that thought instead of the original ones?\n\nPatient: I think the guilt and sadness would go down, maybe to around 50 instead of 80 and 70. And the overwhelm might go down a bit too, maybe to 70 instead of 85.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant difference. This is a great example of how our thoughts can influence our emotions, and how challenging those thoughts can help us feel better.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's just hard to remember to do that in the moment when I'm feeling really emotional.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. It takes practice to be able to catch those automatic thoughts and challenge them in the moment. That's why we start by doing thought records after the fact, like we just did. Over time, it will get easier to do it in real-time.\n\nAnother thing that can help is having some go-to coping statements or self-compassionate phrases that you can use when you're feeling overwhelmed by emotions. For example, you could try saying to yourself \"I'm doing the best I can right now,\" or \"It's okay to struggle, I'm still learning and growing.\"\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I'll try to come up with some phrases that resonate with me.\n\nTherapist: Great! It's also important to remember that self-compassion isn't about letting yourself off the hook or not taking responsibility. It's about acknowledging that you're human, that you're doing your best, and that you deserve kindness and understanding, even when you make mistakes or fall short of your own expectations.\n\nPatient: That's a helpful reminder. I tend to be really hard on myself, so self-compassion is something I need to work on.\n\nTherapist: Many people find self-compassion challenging, but it's a crucial part of managing depression and overall mental health. We can continue to work on it together.\n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit and talk about the hopelessness you mentioned. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nPatient: It's just this feeling that things will never change, that I'll always feel this way. I've been struggling with depression for so long, and even though I have good days or moments, it always seems to come back.\n\nTherapist: That feeling of hopelessness is a common symptom of depression, and it can be really tough to shake. One thing that can help is focusing on small, manageable goals and celebrating the progress you make, rather than getting caught up in the bigger picture.\n\nFor example, you mentioned that you had a difficult but productive conversation with your partner recently. That's a small goal you set and achieved, and it's worth acknowledging and celebrating, even if there's still work to be done in your relationship.\n\nPatient: That's true. I guess I tend to focus on the negative and discount the progress I've made.\n\nTherapist: That's another common cognitive distortion - discounting the positive. It's important to catch those distortions and reframe them, just like we did with the thought record earlier.\n\nAnother thing that can help with hopelessness is engaging in activities that give you a sense of pleasure or mastery, even if you don't feel like doing them at first. This is called behavioral activation, and it's based on the idea that our actions can influence our mood, just like our thoughts can.\n\nFor example, you mentioned that you enjoy gardening and cooking. Even if you don't feel motivated to do those things, try setting a small, achievable goal related to one of them, like spending 10 minutes watering your plants or cooking a simple meal.\n\nPatient: I can try that. I know I usually feel a little better after doing something productive or enjoyable, even if it's small.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Over time, those small actions can add up to big changes in your mood and overall outlook. And as you build momentum, it becomes easier to do more and more.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to set some small goals for myself this week and see how it goes.\n\nTherapist: That's great! Remember to start small and be kind to yourself if you don't meet your goals right away. The important thing is that you keep trying and celebrate the progress you do make.",
