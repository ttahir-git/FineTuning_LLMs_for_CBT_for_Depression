  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Ash, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or significant experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been feeling a bit more hopeful. I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and behavioral activation. It's not always easy, but I think it's helping me gain more awareness of my thought patterns and how they impact my mood.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some positive changes in your awareness and mood. Building these skills takes time and effort, so it's wonderful that you're persevering. \n\nBefore we dive deeper, let's set an agenda for today's session. We can review your progress with the homework, discuss any challenges or insights that came up, and explore some new techniques to add to your toolkit. What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my progress with the homework and discuss some challenges I faced. I also want to explore how I can continue challenging my perfectionism, as it's still a significant barrier for me.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a productive plan. We can start by reviewing your thought records and discussing any patterns or challenges that emerged. Then, we can explore some additional techniques to help you challenge perfectionism, such as cognitive restructuring and behavioral experiments. How does that sound?",
