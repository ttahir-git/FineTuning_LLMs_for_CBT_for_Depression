  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Ash, it's great to see you again for session 10. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted support person in your life. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret your non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and emotions openly through your words. With that said, how have you been since our last session? How has your mood been, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to keep up with the thought records and self-compassion phrases, but it's been challenging at times. My mood has been a bit low, and I've been struggling with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, especially when it comes to my job search and relationship.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Ash. It's common to experience ups and downs throughout the therapeutic process, and I'm here to support you through those challenges. Let's take a closer look at what's been contributing to your feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. Can you share a specific situation or thought that triggered these feelings recently?\n\nPatient: Well, I recently applied for a job that I thought I was well-suited for, but I didn't even get an interview. It made me feel like I'm not good enough and that I'll never find a job that fulfills me. And in my relationship, I've been feeling like I'm not doing enough to support my partner, and that I'm letting them down.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing those experiences, Ash. I can understand how those situations might trigger feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. Let's explore those thoughts further. When you say, \"I'm not good enough,\" what do you think that means about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel like I'm fundamentally flawed and unlovable. Like there's something inherently wrong with me that prevents me from succeeding in my career and relationship.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Ash. It sounds like we might be tapping into a core belief. Core beliefs are deeply held beliefs about ourselves, others, and the world that often develop early in life and can influence how we interpret situations and experiences. The belief that you're \"fundamentally flawed and unlovable\" could be contributing to the negative thoughts and feelings you've been experiencing. Would you be open to exploring this belief further and working on reframing it?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that could be really helpful. I want to challenge that belief and develop a more balanced and compassionate view of myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, and I'm here to support you in that process. Before we dive deeper, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. We can prioritize exploring and reframing this core belief, and we can also touch on your progress with the thought records and self-compassion phrases. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'd also like to discuss some strategies for managing my mood and coping with stress, if we have time.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely incorporate that into our agenda. Let's start by exploring the core belief that you're \"fundamentally flawed and unlovable.\" Can you think of any experiences or evidence that challenge this belief?",
