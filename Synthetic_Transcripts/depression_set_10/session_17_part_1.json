  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Ash, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. I want to acknowledge that as your AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to working with you and supporting your mental health journey. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate your commitment to my mental health journey. Since our last session, I've had some ups and downs. I've been trying to practice the mindfulness techniques we discussed, and the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise has been helpful in managing overwhelming thoughts and emotions. However, I've still been struggling with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the mindfulness techniques, particularly the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise, have been helpful for you in managing overwhelming thoughts and emotions. It's also important that you're sharing your struggles with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness. We can definitely explore these challenges further in today's session. Before we dive in, could you share a bit more about how your mood has been and if there have been any significant changes or events since our last session?\n\nPatient: My mood has been relatively stable, but I've had moments where I feel really down and struggle to find the motivation to do anything. I haven't had any major events or changes since our last session, but I've been putting off looking for a new job because I'm afraid of being rejected again.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that the fear of rejection can make the job search process challenging. We can definitely discuss strategies to help you manage those fears and build resilience. Based on what you've shared, I'd like to suggest a few items for our agenda today:\n\n1. Review your progress on the homework assignments, including mindfulness practice, positive data log, and thought records.\n2. Explore the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, particularly around the job search process and feelings of worthlessness.\n3. Introduce additional techniques for managing depressive symptoms, such as behavioral activation and problem-solving.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
