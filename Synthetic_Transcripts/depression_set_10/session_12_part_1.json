  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Ash, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our previous session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. I've had some good days where I felt more motivated and hopeful, but there have also been days where I struggled with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness. I tried to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and behavioral activation, but it's been challenging at times.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience a range of emotions and face challenges when working on managing depression. I'm glad to hear that you've had some good days and that you've been trying to practice the techniques we've discussed. Can you share more about the specific challenges you faced while using thought records and engaging in behavioral activation?\n\nPatient: With thought records, I sometimes find it hard to identify the evidence against my negative thoughts. When I'm feeling really low, it's like my mind is clouded, and I can only see the negative aspects of a situation. As for behavioral activation, there are days when I just don't feel motivated to do anything, even activities that I usually enjoy.\n\nTherapist: I understand how challenging it can be to shift your perspective when you're feeling low. It's great that you're aware of these difficulties. We can definitely work on strategies to make the process of identifying evidence and engaging in activities more manageable for you. \n\nBefore we dive deeper into that, let's set an agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to:\n\n1. Review your homework from the previous session and discuss any insights or challenges\n2. Explore strategies to make thought records and behavioral activation more accessible for you\n3. Introduce a new technique called \"behavioral experiments\" to help challenge some of your negative beliefs\n\nHow does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think it would also be helpful to discuss how I can manage the feelings of guilt and worthlessness that come up when I'm not able to meet my own expectations or when I compare myself to others.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's a great addition to our agenda. We can explore those feelings of guilt and worthlessness and work on developing some coping strategies. Let's start by reviewing your homework from the previous session. How did you find the process of completing thought records and engaging in behavioral activation activities?",
