  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for CBT session 10 with Emilio:\n\nPatient: Sure, I can share some examples from my thought records. Just the other day, I was feeling really down and had the thought, \"I'm never going to be able to have a successful career.\" I tried to challenge that thought, but I had a hard time coming up with evidence against it in the moment.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you were able to identify that negative thought and attempt to challenge it. Challenging long-standing negative beliefs can be difficult, especially in the moment when emotions are running high. Let's break down this thought together and see if we can identify any cognitive distortions or evidence against it. What emotions were you feeling when you had this thought?\n\nPatient: I was feeling really hopeless and discouraged. I've been unemployed for so long, and it just feels like I'm never going to be able to get back on track.\n\nTherapist: Those are understandable emotions given your situation. Now, let's look at the thought itself: \"I'm never going to be able to have a successful career.\" Do you notice any cognitive distortions in this thought, such as all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, or fortune-telling?\n\nPatient: I guess it is kind of fortune-telling, isn't it? I'm predicting that I'll never be able to have a successful career, even though I can't know for sure what the future holds.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. Fortune-telling is a common cognitive distortion where we predict negative outcomes without evidence. Now, let's look for evidence against this thought. Have there been any times in your life when you've been successful in your career or education?\n\nPatient: Well, I did graduate with honors from a prestigious university and earned a Master's degree in Linguistics. And I was successful in my military career before I was discharged.\n\nTherapist: Those are significant accomplishments, Emilio. They provide evidence that you have the ability to be successful in your career and education. It's also important to remember that success doesn't have to be all-or-nothing. There may be setbacks or challenges along the way, but that doesn't mean you can't have a fulfilling career overall. What do you think about reframing this thought to something like, \"I've had successes in my education and career in the past, and while there may be challenges, I have the ability to work towards a fulfilling career path\"?\n\nPatient: That does sound more balanced. It's hard to remember my past successes when I'm feeling down, but it's true that I have had accomplishments in my life.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Emilio. When we're feeling depressed, it can be difficult to access positive memories and evidence against our negative thoughts. That's why practicing thought records and keeping a Positive Data Log can be so helpful. It allows us to build up evidence against our negative beliefs over time, so we have something to draw on when we're struggling. Let's keep working on identifying and challenging your negative thoughts together. How has your experience been with the Positive Data Log so far?",
