  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job using your coping card related to job search challenges. Can you share how you've been using it and what impact it's had on your thoughts and mood?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to pull out the card whenever I start feeling really discouraged or down about the job search. It helps me remember my strengths and past successes, and that this is just a temporary challenge. It doesn't make all the negative thoughts go away, but it helps me keep perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important point. The goal isn't to eliminate all negative thoughts, but rather to have a more balanced and helpful perspective. It's about recognizing that your thoughts are not always accurate reflections of reality, and that you have the power to challenge them and choose how you respond. How has this shift in perspective impacted your behavior and motivation related to the job search?\n\nPatient: It's helped me stay more consistent and persistent. Instead of getting stuck in a spiral of negative thoughts and giving up, I'm able to refocus on my goals and keep putting in effort. I'm not letting the setbacks derail me as much.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant change in your behavior, and it's directly tied to the work you've been doing to challenge your thoughts. You're breaking out of that cycle of negative thoughts leading to discouragement and inaction. Instead, you're using your coping strategies to maintain a more helpful perspective and stay engaged in your goals. That's a big accomplishment.\n\nPatient: Thanks, it feels good to see that progress. It's still a work in progress, but I feel like I have more tools to handle the challenges now.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, and that's what we've been working towards - building up your toolbox of skills and strategies so that you feel more equipped to handle life's challenges, including the job search. Speaking of tools, let's revisit your core belief of \"I'm not good enough\" and the intermediate belief of \"If I'm not competent or capable, then I'll never be able to succeed or have the life I want.\" How have those beliefs been showing up for you lately, and how have you been working to challenge them?\n\nPatient: Those beliefs still pop up, especially when I'm feeling down or facing a setback. But I've been trying to use the evidence from my Positive Data Log to remind myself that they're not true. I have been successful in the past, and I do have valuable skills and experiences. It's just hard to fully believe that sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. These core beliefs are often deeply ingrained and can take time to shift. The key is to keep challenging them with evidence and developing new, more helpful beliefs. One strategy we haven't talked about yet is using affirmations or mantras. This involves creating short, positive statements that directly counteract your negative core beliefs. For example, you could create an affirmation like \"I am capable and worthy, and I have what it takes to succeed.\" The idea is to repeat this affirmation to yourself regularly, especially when you're struggling with negative thoughts. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's like having a quick reminder of the new beliefs I'm trying to build. I could write it on a sticky note or set a reminder on my phone to help me remember to use it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great way to incorporate it into your daily life. Affirmations can be really powerful in helping to shift those deeply held beliefs over time. Another strategy is to create a visual representation of your new beliefs, like a collage or vision board. You could include images and words that represent your strengths, accomplishments, and goals. Having that visual reminder can help reinforce the new beliefs you're working to develop.\n\nPatient: I've never thought about making a vision board before, but I like the idea. It could be a good way to keep myself focused on the positive and on what I'm working towards.\n\nTherapist: Definitely. It's all about finding strategies that resonate with you and help you stay connected to your new, more helpful beliefs. As we continue to work on shifting these core beliefs, it's also important to plan for how you'll maintain your progress after our sessions end. We've talked about this a bit before, but I want to make sure you feel confident in your ability to continue using your CBT skills independently. What do you feel are the most important tools and strategies you've gained from our work together, and how do you plan to continue using them going forward?",
