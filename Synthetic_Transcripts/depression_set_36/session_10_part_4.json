We can discuss your findings and any thoughts or concerns that come up in our next session.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll do my best to keep up with the homework and reach out to a teaching program. It feels good to have a plan and some concrete steps to work on.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Emilio. I'm confident that with continued practice and effort, you'll make progress towards your goals. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. I'm here to support you, and there are also support groups and other resources available if you need additional help.\n\nDo you have any final questions or concerns before we end today's session?\n\nPatient: No, I think I'm good for now. Thank you for your help and support.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Emilio. I'm glad I can be here to support you on your journey.
