  "transcript": "Patient: No, I think that covers the main things I wanted to discuss today. We can start with the job interview situation.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's begin there. Can you walk me through what happened with the job interview? What thoughts and feelings came up for you before, during, and after the interview?\n\nPatient: Well, before the interview, I was really nervous. I kept thinking, \"I'm not qualified enough for this job\" and \"They're going to see right through me.\" During the interview, I felt like I stumbled over my words a few times, and I couldn't tell if they were impressed with my answers. After the interview, when I didn't hear back, I started thinking, \"I knew I wasn't good enough\" and \"They probably thought I was a joke.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Emilio. I can hear how much this experience impacted you. Let's take a closer look at some of those thoughts using a thought record. We'll start with the thought, \"I'm not qualified enough for this job.\" What emotions did that thought bring up for you?\n\nPatient: I felt really anxious and inadequate. I guess I'd rate the intensity of those emotions at about an 8 out of 10.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write that down. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not qualified enough for the job?\n\nPatient: Well, I don't have as much experience as they were asking for in the job description. And I didn't answer every question perfectly in the interview.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against that thought? What qualifications or strengths do you bring to the table?\n\nPatient: I guess I do have some relevant experience, even if it's not exactly what they were asking for. And I've been learning a lot through my online courses. I'm also a quick learner and a hard worker.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's write those down as evidence against the thought. Now, based on the evidence for and against, can we come up with a more balanced thought?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"I may not have every qualification they're looking for, but I have relevant experience and I'm willing to learn and work hard.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought. How intense are the emotions of anxiety and inadequacy when you think about it that way?\n\nPatient: They're still there, but not as strong. Maybe more like a 5 out of 10.\n\nTherapist: That's progress! This is a great example of how challenging our thoughts can help shift our emotions. Let's keep practicing this with some of the other thoughts you mentioned, like \"They're going to see right through me\" and \"They probably thought I was a joke.\" We can use the same process of looking at evidence for and against, and coming up with more balanced thoughts.\n\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense. It's just hard to remember to do this in the moment when I'm feeling really down on myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Emilio. It takes practice to make this a habit. One thing that can help is to set aside a specific time each day to review your thoughts and challenge them using this process. We call this \"worry time.\" It can help prevent you from getting stuck in a spiral of negative thoughts throughout the day. What do you think about trying that?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I could set aside 15 minutes each evening to go through my thoughts from the day and challenge them.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. And remember, the more you practice, the easier it will get. It's like building a muscle.",
