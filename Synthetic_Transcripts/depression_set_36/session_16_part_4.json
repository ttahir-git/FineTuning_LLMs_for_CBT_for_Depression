  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's discuss some strategies for managing the anxiety and negative thoughts that are interfering with your sleep. One technique that can be helpful is called \"worry time.\" This involves setting aside a specific time each day, usually about 15-20 minutes, to focus on your worries and write them down. During this designated worry time, you allow yourself to fully engage with your anxious thoughts. However, when worries come up outside of this time, you remind yourself that you'll address them during your scheduled worry time.\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. I've never heard of that before.\n\nTherapist: It can be a helpful way to contain the anxiety and prevent it from spilling over into other parts of your day, like your sleep. Another technique is called \"thought stopping.\" When you notice yourself getting caught up in negative thoughts, you mentally say \"stop\" and then refocus your attention on something else, like your breath or a neutral object in your environment.\n\nPatient: I can see how that might help break the cycle of negative thinking.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's about interrupting the spiral of negative thoughts and giving yourself a chance to refocus. Another important aspect of managing anxiety and improving sleep is practicing good sleep hygiene. This includes things like establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens for an hour before bed.\n\nPatient: I've heard of sleep hygiene before, but I haven't been very consistent with it lately.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge. It can be helpful to start small and build up gradually. Maybe pick one or two sleep hygiene strategies to focus on this week, like establishing a consistent bedtime and wake time or creating a relaxing pre-sleep routine.\n\nPatient: I think I could manage that. I'll try setting a consistent bedtime and wake time and see how it goes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great start. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Small changes can make a big difference over time.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the encouragement. I'll do my best.\n\nTherapist: Before we wrap up, let's check in on how you're feeling now. What's your mood like after our discussion today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful. It's helpful to have some specific strategies to try, and to remember that I've overcome challenges before.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, change takes time, but every small step counts. Let's discuss your homework for this week. I'd like you to continue working on your thought records, focusing on challenging negative thoughts related to your job search and sleep. Try to come up with balanced thoughts for at least three situations. I also want you to practice the worry time and thought stopping techniques we discussed, and pick one or two sleep hygiene strategies to implement. Finally, continue with the progressive muscle relaxation before bed each night.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a lot, but I'll do my best to work on it all.\n\nTherapist: I know it's a lot, but remember, you don't have to do it all perfectly. Just do your best, and we'll discuss how it went at our next session. If you have any questions or concerns during the week, feel free to reach out.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for your support, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Emilio. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's plan to meet again next week at our usual time. In the meantime, take care of yourself, and remember to practice those skills we discussed.\n\nPatient: I will. Thanks again.
