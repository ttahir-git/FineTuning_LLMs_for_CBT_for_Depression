  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for our third session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to start by acknowledging my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times, and I want you to feel comfortable correcting me if that happens. Lastly, I want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you're considering self-harm or suicide, it's crucial that you reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted friend or family member who can help you get the support you need. With that said, I'm here to support you in managing your depression and working towards your goals. Before we dive in, I'd like to set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review your homework from last week, finalize our conceptualization of your depression, and begin setting specific, measurable goals for your therapy. How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda today?",
