  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you reached out to someone who teaches language classes. How did that conversation go, and what insights did you gain from it?\n\nPatient: The conversation went well. They were very encouraging and gave me some good advice about getting started in teaching. They suggested I look into getting a teaching certificate and offered to help me with the process. But afterwards, I started to feel really anxious and overwhelmed about the whole idea.\n\nTherapist: It's common to feel anxious when considering a big change like this. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. What thoughts were going through your mind after the conversation?\n\nPatient: I kept thinking that I'm not qualified enough, that I'll never be able to find a job, and that I'll disappoint everyone, including myself. I started to feel like maybe this whole idea was a mistake.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like some distressing thoughts. I notice a few cognitive distortions in what you're saying, like all-or-nothing thinking and catastrophizing. Remember, just because a thought feels true doesn't necessarily mean it is true. Let's explore these thoughts further. Can you identify any evidence that contradicts these thoughts?\n\nPatient: Well, the person I talked to said I have a lot of the skills and qualities that make a good teacher. And I do have a lot of experience with languages. But it's hard to believe them when I'm feeling so anxious.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. It's hard to believe contradictory evidence when we're in the midst of intense emotions. One strategy that can help is to imagine what you would say to a friend who was in a similar situation. What advice would you give them?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them to take it one step at a time and not get too caught up in worrying about the future. I'd remind them that everyone has to start somewhere and that it's okay to make mistakes.\n\nTherapist: That's wise advice. Can you try to apply that same perspective to your own situation?\n\nPatient: I can try. It's harder to do with myself, but I can see how that perspective would be more helpful than getting stuck in worst-case scenario thinking.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Challenging those distorted thoughts and replacing them with more balanced, realistic ones can help reduce the intensity of the anxiety. Another strategy is to focus on the present moment and the next small step, rather than getting caught up in worrying about the future. What's one small step you could take towards your goal of teaching?\n\nPatient: I guess I could look into the requirements for getting a teaching certificate, like the person I talked to suggested. That feels manageable.\n\nTherapist: That's a great next step! Breaking the process down into smaller, concrete actions can make it feel less overwhelming. And remember, you don't have to do this alone. You can lean on your support system, including me, for encouragement and guidance along the way.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I do have people in my life who want to support me, and I need to remember to reach out to them when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Building and utilizing a support system is an important part of managing depression and anxiety. Speaking of support, how have you been doing with reaching out to others and engaging in social activities?\n\nPatient: It's been a bit of a challenge. I've been attending my church group regularly, which has been helpful, but I've been hesitant to reach out to people outside of that. I'm worried about being a burden or not fitting in.\n\nTherapist: Those are common concerns, and they can make it hard to reach out. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. What evidence do you have that you would be a burden or not fit in?",
