  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for the CBT session:\n\nPatient: Sure, let me pull up my thought records from this past week. Here's one that I found particularly challenging. The situation was that I had a job interview, and I didn't get the job. My emotions were sadness and disappointment, both at an intensity of 8 out of 10. My automatic thought was \"I'm never going to get a job because I'm not good enough.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing this, Emilio. I can understand why this situation would bring up strong emotions and negative thoughts, especially given your core belief of \"I'm not good enough.\" Let's take a closer look at this thought record together. What evidence did you write down that supports the thought \"I'm never going to get a job because I'm not good enough\"?\n\nPatient: Well, the evidence I wrote down was that I didn't get this job, and I've been unemployed for two years now. It feels like every job application I send out gets rejected.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, and I know it can be disheartening to face repeated rejections. What about evidence against this thought? Were you able to identify any?\n\nPatient: It was hard, but I tried. I wrote down that I have a Master's degree and a lot of valuable skills from my past work experience. I also wrote that I've gotten interviews in the past, so there must be something about me that employers see as valuable.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you were able to identify some evidence against the negative thought, even though it was difficult. The fact that you have a Master's degree, valuable skills, and have gotten interviews in the past does provide evidence that you have qualities that make you employable. What was the alternative thought you came up with after looking at the evidence for and against?\n\nPatient: My alternative thought was \"Not getting this job doesn't mean I'll never get a job. I have valuable skills and qualifications that make me a good candidate, even if it doesn't work out every time.\"\n\nTherapist: I think that's a much more balanced and helpful way to look at the situation, Emilio. It acknowledges the disappointment of not getting the job while also recognizing your strengths and the reality that one rejection doesn't determine your entire future. How did your emotions change after coming up with this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: My sadness and disappointment went down to about a 5 out of 10. It still stung, but I didn't feel quite as hopeless.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, Emilio, and it shows the power of challenging negative thoughts and coming up with more balanced alternatives. I know it's not easy, but the more you practice this skill, the more automatic it will become. Let's look at another thought record you found challenging, and we can practice identifying evidence against negative thoughts together.",
