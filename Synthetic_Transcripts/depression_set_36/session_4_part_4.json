  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate your suggestions for building a support network. I think I'll start by talking to some of the people at my church who I feel close to. Maybe they can offer some guidance or support as I explore new career options.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Emilio. Remember, building a support network is a gradual process, and starting with people you already trust is a wise approach. As you continue to explore new career paths and engage in meaningful activities, you may naturally start to expand your support network and feel more confident in reaching out to others.\n\nBefore we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on your current mood and any final thoughts you may have. How are you feeling right now?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also hopeful. I know that making changes won't be easy, but I feel like I have a better understanding of what I need to do to manage my depression and work towards a more fulfilling career.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed when facing significant changes, but it's great to hear that you're also feeling hopeful. Remember, change is a process, and it's okay to take small steps forward. You've made progress today by identifying your values, skills, and interests, and by discussing strategies for managing your depression and building a support network.\n\nFor homework, I'd like you to continue practicing the mindfulness and grounding techniques we discussed today, especially when you notice yourself feeling angry or impulsive. Also, try to engage in at least one activity related to your career exploration, such as researching potential job opportunities or reaching out to someone in your support network for guidance.\n\nIn our next session, we can review your thought records and discuss any challenges or insights that came up while completing the homework. We can also continue to explore potential career paths and discuss ways to expand your support network. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll do my best to complete the homework and come prepared for our next session.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, the homework is meant to help you practice the skills we discuss in therapy and apply them to your daily life. It's not about being perfect, but rather about making progress and learning from your experiences.\n\nThank you for your hard work today, Emilio. I'm proud of the progress you've made, and I'm confident that you have the strength and resilience to continue moving forward. If you have any questions or concerns between now and our next session, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova.
