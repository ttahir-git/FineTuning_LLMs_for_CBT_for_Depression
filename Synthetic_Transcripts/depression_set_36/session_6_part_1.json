  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 6. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I appreciate you sharing those limitations. It's good to know what to expect. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the mindfulness and grounding techniques we discussed. It's been challenging, but I think it's helping a bit with managing my overwhelming emotions. I also started looking into the requirements for becoming a language teacher, like you suggested. It feels daunting, but breaking it down into smaller steps makes it seem more manageable.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we discussed and that you're finding them somewhat helpful. It's also great that you've taken the first step towards exploring a career in teaching. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. Now, let's set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review your thought records and discuss any challenges or insights that came up while completing the homework. We can also check in on your progress with mindfulness and grounding techniques and explore any benefits or challenges you've experienced. Additionally, we can follow up on your career exploration activities and discuss next steps for pursuing teaching or other potential career paths. Lastly, we can explore strategies for expanding your support network and managing anxiety related to reaching out to others. How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'd also like to talk about how I've been feeling this past week. I've had some ups and downs, and I think it's important to discuss that.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Emilio. Let's start with how you've been feeling this past week. Can you tell me more about the ups and downs you've experienced?",
