  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted support person. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please let me know if there's anything important I might be missing. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being transparent about your limitations. I appreciate the support you've provided me so far, and I feel comfortable continuing our work together.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Emilio. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been feeling a bit more hopeful since our last session. I sent the email to the teaching certification program, which was a big step for me. I haven't heard back yet, but I'm trying to be patient. I've also been continuing with the thought records and Positive Data Log, although I still find it challenging to use these tools when I'm really distressed.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been feeling more hopeful and that you took the brave step of sending the email. Acknowledging the challenges you face with using the tools during distressing moments is an important insight. We can definitely explore strategies to make the thought records and Positive Data Log more accessible during those times. How about your mood and other depressive symptoms? Have you noticed any changes there?\n\nPatient: My mood has been relatively stable, with some ups and downs. I've had a few days where I struggled to get out of bed, but I've been trying to push myself to engage in activities I know are good for me, like going for walks with my dogs. I've also been connecting more with people from my church community, which has been helpful.\n\nTherapist: It's encouraging to hear that you've been able to engage in activities and connect with your support system, even when it feels challenging. Those are important steps in managing your depressive symptoms. Let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. We can review your homework, discuss your experience with sending the email, and explore strategies for using the thought records and Positive Data Log during distressing moments. Are there any other topics or concerns you'd like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I'd also like to discuss the social interaction experiment we talked about last time. I tried it out, and I have some thoughts I'd like to share. And maybe we could talk more about my fears around pursuing the teaching certification, if there's time.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, those are both important topics. Let's add the social interaction experiment and your fears around pursuing the teaching certification to our agenda. We can start by reviewing your homework and then move on to discussing your experience with sending the email. We'll make sure to leave time to explore your thoughts on the social interaction experiment and your fears around the teaching certification. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.",
