  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for our 10th session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI before we begin. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I want you to feel comfortable correcting me if I misunderstand something. Additionally, as an AI, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, it's essential to reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted support person. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so I encourage you to express your thoughts and feelings as openly as possible. With that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards improved mental well-being. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I've been doing alright since our last session. I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like mindfulness and thought records, but it's still a challenge sometimes. I did have a positive experience reaching out to someone from my church, and we had a good conversation. It felt nice to connect with someone, but I still get anxious and have negative thoughts when I'm in social situations.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've had a positive experience reaching out to someone from your church. It's a great step forward in challenging your negative beliefs about friendships and social interactions. At the same time, it's understandable that you still experience anxiety and negative thoughts in social situations. Changing long-standing patterns of thinking takes time and practice. Let's explore your experience a bit more. What thoughts went through your mind during the conversation with your friend from church?\n\nPatient: Well, at first I was really nervous. I kept thinking, \"What if I say something stupid?\" or \"They probably don't really want to talk to me.\" But as the conversation went on, I started to feel a bit more comfortable. I realized that they seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say, and we had some common interests.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. It's common to have those initial anxious thoughts, but it's encouraging that you were able to recognize the evidence that contradicted those thoughts as the conversation progressed. This is a great example of how we can use our experiences to challenge our negative beliefs. I'd like to spend some time today reviewing your thought records and Positive Data Log to see how you've been doing with identifying and challenging your negative thoughts. We can also discuss your progress with mindfulness and explore your next steps in pursuing teaching certification programs. How does that sound for our agenda today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I've been trying to keep up with the thought records and Positive Data Log, but I've had some challenges with labeling the cognitive distortions in the moment. And I'm excited to talk more about the teaching certification programs. I've done some research, but I'm still feeling a bit overwhelmed by the process.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been working on the thought records and Positive Data Log, and it's normal to have challenges with labeling cognitive distortions in the moment. We can review some examples together and discuss strategies for making it easier to identify them. Regarding the teaching certification programs, it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Breaking down the process into smaller, manageable steps can be helpful. We can explore your thoughts and feelings about the process and work on developing a plan that feels more manageable for you. Let's start by reviewing your thought records and Positive Data Log. Can you share some examples of thoughts you've recorded and any challenges you've faced in identifying and challenging them?",
