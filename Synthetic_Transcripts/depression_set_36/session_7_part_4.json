  "transcript": "Patient: I can't think of any specific evidence, but it's just a feeling I have. I worry that people won't want to be around me if I'm struggling or that I'll say or do something embarrassing.\n\nTherapist: Those are common fears, and they can be very distressing. One thing to keep in mind is that feelings are not always an accurate reflection of reality. Just because we feel something doesn't necessarily mean it's true. Let's explore this further. Can you think of any times when you've reached out to someone and it's gone well, even if you were struggling?\n\nPatient: Well, there have been times when I've talked to my pastor about how I'm feeling, and he's always been very supportive and understanding. And my sister has been there for me too, even when I've been at my lowest.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples! They provide strong evidence against the belief that people won't want to be around you if you're struggling. It's important to remember and focus on these positive experiences, even when the fear is loud. Another strategy is to test out these beliefs by taking small risks in social situations and seeing what happens. For example, you could try reaching out to someone in your church group and asking if they want to grab coffee or go for a walk. How does that feel to you?\n\nPatient: It feels a little scary, but I can see how it could be helpful. I guess I've been assuming that people don't want to spend time with me, but I haven't really tested that assumption.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! By testing out these assumptions, we can gather more accurate information about how people respond to us. And even if it doesn't go perfectly, we can learn from the experience and use it to inform our future interactions. Remember, social connections are a key part of managing depression, so it's worth taking some risks to build those connections.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to keep that in mind and look for opportunities to reach out to people more.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal! I'm here to support you in that process. As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling. What's your overall mood right now?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better than when we started. Talking through these things has helped me feel a bit more hopeful and less stuck in my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. It's great that you're noticing a shift in your mood. Remember, change is a process, and it takes time and practice. But every small step counts, and you're doing the work to move in a positive direction. For homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the mindfulness and grounding techniques we've discussed, and try to fill out a thought record whenever you notice yourself feeling overwhelmed or distressed. I'd also like you to take one small step towards your goal of teaching, whether that's researching requirements or reaching out to someone in the field. And finally, I'd like you to look for one opportunity to reach out to someone socially, even if it feels a bit uncomfortable. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: It sounds like a lot, but I know it's important. I'll do my best to follow through on all of those things.\n\nTherapist: That's great! Remember, it's okay if it doesn't go perfectly. The important thing is that you're making an effort and taking steps forward. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's plan to meet again next week at the same time. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you need any support or guidance.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I'll see you next week.\n\nSession Summary:\nMain topics discussed:\n- Reviewed Emilio's progress with mindfulness and grounding techniques and thought records.\n- Explored Emilio's anxiety about pursuing a new career path in teaching and identified cognitive distortions contributing to the anxiety.\n- Discussed Emilio's conversation with the person who teaches language classes and identified next steps towards exploring teaching.\n- Addressed Emilio's fears about reaching out to others socially and discussed strategies for testing out these fears.\n\nTechniques or exercises used:\n- Mindfulness and grounding: Encouraged Emilio to continue practicing these techniques regularly to manage overwhelming emotions and reduce stress.\n- Thought records: Reviewed Emilio's thought records and discussed challenges with identifying cognitive distortions in the moment.
