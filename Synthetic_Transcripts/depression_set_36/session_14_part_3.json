  "transcript": "Patient: I have another thought record here that I struggled with. The situation was that I had a disagreement with my sister over the phone, and it ended with her hanging up on me. My emotions were anger and guilt, both at an intensity of 7 out of 10. My automatic thought was \"I always ruin relationships with my anger and impulsivity.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing this, Emilio. Disagreements with loved ones can be particularly challenging, especially when they trigger negative thoughts about ourselves. Let's take a closer look at this thought record. What evidence did you write down that supports the thought \"I always ruin relationships with my anger and impulsivity\"?\n\nPatient: The evidence I wrote down was that my sister hung up on me, and I've had similar arguments with other family members and friends in the past. It feels like a pattern.\n\nTherapist: I understand how that pattern might lead you to believe that you always ruin relationships. What about evidence against this thought? Were you able to identify any?\n\nPatient: It was tough, but I tried to think of counter-evidence. I wrote down that I have some friendships that have lasted for years, despite my anger and impulsivity. And even with my sister, we've had arguments before, but we always seem to reconcile eventually.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you were able to identify some evidence against the negative thought, even though it was challenging. The fact that you have long-lasting friendships and that you and your sister have been able to reconcile in the past does provide evidence that your anger and impulsivity don't always ruin your relationships. What was the alternative thought you came up with after looking at the evidence for and against?\n\nPatient: My alternative thought was \"While my anger and impulsivity can strain my relationships at times, they don't always ruin them. I have relationships that have withstood these challenges, and I have the ability to repair relationships when needed.\"\n\nTherapist: I think that's a much more balanced and helpful way to look at the situation, Emilio. It acknowledges the challenges your anger and impulsivity can create in relationships while also recognizing your ability to maintain and repair relationships. How did your emotions change after coming up with this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: My anger and guilt went down to about a 4 out of 10. I still felt upset about the argument, but I didn't feel as hopeless about my ability to have healthy relationships.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, Emilio, and it shows how powerful it can be to challenge negative thoughts and come up with more balanced alternatives. As we discussed earlier, the more you practice this skill, the more automatic it will become.",
