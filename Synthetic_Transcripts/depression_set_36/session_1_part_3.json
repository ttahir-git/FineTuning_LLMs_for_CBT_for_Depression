  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you saying that, Nova. It's just hard to believe sometimes.\n\nTherapist: I understand, Emilio. It can be difficult to have hope when you've been struggling for a long time. I want to assure you that you're not alone in this, and we'll work together to find strategies that can help you feel better. You mentioned earlier that you've been coping by taking care of your dogs and learning new languages. Can you tell me more about how those activities help you?\n\nPatient: Well, my dogs are always happy to see me, even when I'm feeling down. Taking care of them gives me a sense of purpose, like I'm needed. And learning languages helps me focus on something other than my thoughts. It's like a mental escape.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've found activities that provide a sense of purpose and distraction from your negative thoughts. Those are really important coping strategies. In addition to your dogs and learning languages, what other supports do you have in your life right now?\n\nPatient: Like I mentioned before, my church community has been really supportive. They accept me for who I am, and I feel like I can be myself around them. But outside of that, I don't really have many people I can turn to.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful that you've found a supportive community in your church. Having a sense of belonging and acceptance can be really helpful when you're dealing with depression. As we continue with therapy, we can explore ways to expand your support system and build connections with others who understand what you're going through.\n\nPatient: I've never been great at making friends. I always feel like I'm too much for people, like my depression and my identity are too heavy for them to handle.\n\nTherapist: It's common for people with depression to feel like they're a burden to others. But I want to remind you that your feelings and experiences are valid, and there are people out there who can and want to support you. As we work together, we can find ways to challenge those beliefs and build your confidence in reaching out to others.\n\nPatient: I guess I'm just scared of getting hurt again. I've been let down by so many people in my life, and it's hard to trust that anyone will stick around.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel scared and hesitant to trust others, especially when you've been hurt in the past. Building trust takes time, and it's okay to take things slowly. As we continue with therapy, we can work on developing skills to help you build and maintain healthy relationships, and to cope with any challenges that may arise.\n\nPatient: I hope you're right. I just feel like I've been dealing with this for so long, and I don't know if anything can really change.\n\nTherapist: I understand why you might feel that way, but I want to encourage you to have hope. Recovery from depression is possible, and you've already taken a big step by reaching out for help. Can you tell me a bit about your experience with therapy in the past? What worked for you, and what didn't?\n\nPatient: I've seen a few different therapists over the years, but I never really clicked with any of them. I felt like they didn't understand what it's like to be a transgender veteran dealing with depression. And I have a hard time opening up to people, so I didn't always feel like I was getting much out of it.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Emilio. It's important that you feel understood and supported in therapy, and I'm committed to creating a safe space where you can be open and honest about your experiences. As we continue to work together, I encourage you to let me know if there's anything I can do to help you feel more comfortable or if there are topics you'd like to focus on in our sessions.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I'll try to keep that in mind. I guess I'm just worried that I'm too broken for therapy to really help.\n\nTherapist: I want to assure you that you're not broken, Emilio. Depression is a treatable condition, and you've already demonstrated a lot of strength and resilience in your life. It takes a lot of courage to keep trying, even when things are tough. As we continue with therapy, we'll work on building on your strengths and finding strategies that work for you.",
