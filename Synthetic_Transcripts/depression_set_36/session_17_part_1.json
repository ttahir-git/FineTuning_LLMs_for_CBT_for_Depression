  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, which can be an important aspect of therapy. With all that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I've been doing alright, I guess. I've been trying to work on the thought records and the other techniques we discussed, but it's been challenging. I'm still struggling with sleep, and I had a couple of rough days where I felt really down.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Emilio. It's not uncommon to have ups and downs throughout the therapy process. Can you tell me more about the rough days you experienced? What thoughts or feelings came up for you during those times?\n\nPatient: Well, I had a job interview last week, and I thought it went pretty well. But then I didn't hear back from them, and I started thinking that I must have messed up somehow. I kept dwelling on all the things I could have said differently or done better. It just sent me into a spiral of self-doubt and feeling like a failure.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a really difficult experience, Emilio. I'm here to support you through it. Based on what you've shared, it seems like the job interview triggered some of those familiar negative thoughts and core beliefs we've been working on, like \"I'm not good enough.\" I'd like to spend some time today exploring that situation further and see if we can identify any cognitive distortions or alternative perspectives. We can also review your thought records and see how they've been helping you challenge those negative thoughts. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: Yeah, that sounds good. I could definitely use some help making sense of it all.\n\nTherapist: Great. Before we dive into that, let's take a moment to set an agenda for our session today. We can prioritize discussing the job interview and the thoughts and feelings that came up around that. We can also review your thought records and see how they've been helping you challenge negative thoughts. And if time allows, we can touch on your sleep and see if there have been any changes or improvements with the sleep hygiene strategies we discussed. Does that agenda work for you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
