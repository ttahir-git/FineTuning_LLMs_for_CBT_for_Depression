  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you walking me through that thought record, Nova. It helps to see things from a different perspective.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you found it helpful, Emilio. Practicing this skill regularly can make a big difference in how you feel and respond to challenging situations. Now, let's explore how your thoughts might be impacting your behavior. When you have the thought, \"I'm not qualified enough to be a teacher,\" how does it influence your actions?\n\nPatient: When I think that way, I tend to avoid taking steps towards pursuing teaching. I put off researching programs or reaching out to people in the field because I assume it won't work out anyway.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Emilio. Our thoughts can often lead to avoidance behaviors, which can maintain depressive symptoms. This is where behavioral activation comes in. The idea is to gradually engage in activities that align with your values and goals, even if you don't feel motivated at first. This can help counteract avoidance and build a sense of mastery and pleasure. What do you think about trying a small step related to exploring teaching opportunities?\n\nPatient: I'm willing to try. I guess I could start by reaching out to someone I know who teaches language classes and ask about their experience. It's less daunting than applying for a program right away.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Emilio. Taking small, manageable steps can make the process feel less overwhelming. It's also a way to gather information and connect with others who share your interests. How do you think you'll feel after taking that step?\n\nPatient: I think I'll feel a sense of accomplishment, even if it's just a small step. It might also give me a clearer picture of what's involved in teaching and whether it's a good fit for me.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Engaging in activities that align with your goals can boost your mood and self-confidence. It's also an opportunity to test out some of those alternative thoughts we discussed earlier. I encourage you to pay attention to your thoughts and emotions during and after taking that step. You can even jot them down in a thought record if you find it helpful.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I'll try to be mindful of my thoughts and feelings throughout the process.\n\nTherapist: Great. Remember, the goal is progress, not perfection. Every small step counts, and it's okay if some steps feel more challenging than others. I'm here to support you along the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your guidance and encouragement. It helps to break things down into smaller steps and have a plan to follow.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Emilio. I'm glad you're finding this approach helpful. As we continue to work together, we'll keep exploring how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected and practice skills to create positive changes in each area. Remember, change takes time and practice, but every effort you make is a step towards feeling better and building the life you want.\n\nSession Summary:\nMain topics discussed:\n- Reviewed Emilio's thought records and discussed challenges and insights related to managing depressive symptoms.\n- Checked in on Emilio's progress with mindfulness and grounding techniques.\n- Explored potential career paths, focusing on Emilio's interest in teaching and aligning his strengths and values with job opportunities.\n- Discussed strategies for breaking down the process of pursuing a new career path into smaller, manageable steps.\n- Introduced behavioral activation and explored how thoughts can influence avoidance behaviors.\n\nTechniques or exercises used:\n- Thought records: Emilio continued to practice identifying and challenging cognitive distortions using thought records, with a focus on all-or-nothing thinking and catastrophizing.
