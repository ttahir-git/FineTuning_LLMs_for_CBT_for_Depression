  "transcript": "Patient: I've been focusing my job search on positions in the linguistics field, since that's my background. I've been tailoring my resume and cover letter for each application and trying to network with people in the industry. The interview process has been nerve-wracking, though. I get really anxious beforehand and start doubting myself.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel anxious and have self-doubt during the job search process, especially when you're putting yourself out there and facing potential rejection. Let's explore how you can use your CBT skills to manage these feelings. When you notice yourself feeling anxious or doubting yourself, what thoughts tend to come up?\n\nPatient: I often think things like, \"I'm not qualified enough for this position,\" or \"They're going to realize I'm a fraud.\" I start questioning my abilities and comparing myself to other candidates.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are great examples of cognitive distortions, specifically all-or-nothing thinking and mind-reading. Remember, just because you have these thoughts doesn't mean they're true. Let's practice challenging these thoughts using the evidence you've collected in your Positive Data Log. Can you share some examples of evidence that contradicts these negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: Well, I have my degree in linguistics and several years of experience in the field. I've also received positive feedback from colleagues and supervisors in the past. And I know I'm a hard worker and a quick learner.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! That's strong evidence against the thought that you're not qualified or a fraud. Whenever you notice these negative thoughts popping up, I want you to pause and review the evidence in your Positive Data Log. Remind yourself of your qualifications, accomplishments, and positive feedback you've received. This will help you challenge the cognitive distortions and reframe your thoughts in a more balanced way.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to be more mindful of my thoughts and use the evidence in my Positive Data Log to challenge them.\n\nTherapist: Great! Another helpful tool is to create coping cards with reminders of your strengths, accomplishments, and adaptive thoughts. You can keep these cards with you and pull them out whenever you need a boost of confidence or to challenge negative thoughts. Let's create a coping card together now. What are some key points you want to include?\n\nPatient: I could include things like, \"I have a strong educational background and relevant experience,\" \"I've received positive feedback from colleagues and supervisors,\" and \"I'm a hard worker and a quick learner.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are fantastic points to include on your coping card. Remember, the goal is to create a concise, portable reminder of your strengths and evidence against negative thoughts. You can also include an adaptive thought, like \"I am qualified and capable, and I will do my best in the interview.\"\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I'll add that to my coping card as well.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! As you continue with your job search, make sure to use your coping card and Positive Data Log regularly to manage anxiety and self-doubt. It's also important to practice self-care and engage in activities that boost your mood and confidence. What are some self-care activities you can incorporate into your routine?\n\nPatient: I find exercise really helps me manage stress and improve my mood. I also enjoy spending time with my dogs and practicing my language skills.\n\nTherapist: Those are great self-care activities! Make sure to prioritize them, especially during the job search process. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and boost your confidence can help counteract the stress and self-doubt that may arise.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely make an effort to prioritize self-care. It's easy to get caught up in the job search and neglect other areas of my life.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, but prioritizing self-care is crucial for maintaining your mental health and well-being. Remember, your worth is not defined by your job status. You have inherent value as a person, regardless of your employment situation.\n\nPatient: That's a good reminder. I tend to tie my self-worth to my job, but I know deep down that's not healthy or accurate.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Separating your self-worth from your job status is an important step in building a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself. As we continue with our sessions, we'll work on strengthening this new perspective.\n\nPatient: I'm looking forward to continuing our work together. This session has been really helpful in addressing my job search anxiety and self-doubt.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Emilio. Remember, managing anxiety and self-doubt is an ongoing process, but with consistent practice of your CBT skills and self-care, you can build resilience and confidence. Let's continue to explore this topic and check in on your progress in our next session. Until then, keep using your coping card, Positive Data Log, and engaging in self-care activities.",
