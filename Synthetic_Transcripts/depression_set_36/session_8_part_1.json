  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's great to see you again for session 8. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and sometimes I might generate inaccurate information or responses. Also, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Since I can't see or interpret non-verbal cues, please let me know if anything I say doesn't resonate with you or if there's anything you'd like me to clarify. \n\nTo start, I'd like to do a thorough check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes in your mood or overall well-being?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations as an AI, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. Some days I feel more hopeful and motivated, especially when I think about exploring a career in teaching. But other days, I still struggle with feelings of worthlessness and guilt. My sleep has improved slightly, but I'm still having trouble with my appetite.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've had some moments of hope and motivation, especially related to your career exploration. It's also important that we acknowledge the ongoing struggles with feelings of worthlessness, guilt, and changes in appetite. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have ups and downs. \n\nI'd like to propose that we focus on a few key areas today. First, let's review your thought records and discuss any challenges or insights that came up while completing them. We can also check in on your progress with mindfulness and grounding techniques. I'm interested in hearing about any steps you've taken towards exploring teaching and how that's been going. And if you feel comfortable, I'd like to explore your experiences with reaching out to others socially. We can also continue working on addressing your core beliefs and intermediate beliefs. What do you think about this agenda? Is there anything else you'd like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: That agenda sounds good to me, Nova. I did have some challenges with the thought records, so I'd appreciate discussing that further. And I'm excited to share a small step I took towards exploring teaching. I'm a bit nervous to talk about my attempts at socializing, but I know it's important. Let's start with reviewing the thought records.",
