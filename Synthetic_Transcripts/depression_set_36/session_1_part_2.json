  "transcript": "Patient: I just feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of feeling bad about myself and then making it worse by pushing people away or spending money I don't have.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Emilio. Recognizing those patterns is a big step towards making changes. Can you tell me more about how your depression has affected your relationships with your family and friends?\n\nPatient: Well, I don't really talk to my family much anymore. They don't understand why I can't just \"snap out of it\" and get a job. And with my friends, I've canceled plans so many times because I just can't bring myself to leave the house. I know they're frustrated with me, and I don't blame them.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of guilt about how your depression has impacted your relationships. That's a common experience for many people who struggle with depression. I want to assure you that it's not your fault, and it's okay to prioritize your mental health. As we continue with therapy, we'll work on finding ways to communicate your needs to your loved ones and build stronger, healthier relationships.\n\nPatient: I hope you're right. I just feel like I've been dealing with this for so long, and I don't know if anything can really change.\n\nTherapist: I understand why you might feel that way, but I want to encourage you to have hope. Recovery from depression is possible, and you've already taken a big step by reaching out for help. Can you tell me a bit about your experience with therapy in the past? What worked for you, and what didn't?\n\nPatient: I've seen a few different therapists over the years, but I never really clicked with any of them. I felt like they didn't understand what it's like to be a transgender veteran dealing with depression. And I have a hard time opening up to people, so I didn't always feel like I was getting much out of it.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Emilio. It's important that you feel understood and supported in therapy, and I'm committed to creating a safe space where you can be open and honest about your experiences. As we continue to work together, I encourage you to let me know if there's anything I can do to help you feel more comfortable or if there are topics you'd like to focus on in our sessions.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I'll try to keep that in mind. I guess I'm just worried that I'm too broken for therapy to really help.\n\nTherapist: I want to assure you that you're not broken, Emilio. Depression is a treatable condition, and you've already demonstrated a lot of strength and resilience in your life. It takes a lot of courage to keep trying, even when things are tough. As we continue with therapy, we'll work on building on your strengths and finding strategies that work for you.\n\nPatient: I hope you're right.
