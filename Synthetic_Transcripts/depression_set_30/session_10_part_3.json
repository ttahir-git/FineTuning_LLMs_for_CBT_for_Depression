  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned that you've been finding it challenging to come up with evidence for your positive data log. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been difficult about this?\n\nPatient: I think it's just hard to notice and remember the good things, especially when I'm feeling down. The negative stuff seems to stick in my mind more easily.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, and it's actually a common experience for many people. Our brains have a natural tendency to focus on the negative, which is called the negativity bias. It's like our minds are Velcro for negative experiences and Teflon for positive ones. The good news is that we can train our brains to pay more attention to the positive.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. How do I do that?\n\nTherapist: One way is to intentionally look for evidence that supports your new, more balanced beliefs. This might include noticing times when you do speak up in a meeting, when you receive positive feedback, or when you handle a challenging situation well. Another strategy is to set aside a specific time each day to reflect on any positive experiences or evidence you can add to your log.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of having a set time to do that. I could try doing it before bed each night.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan! You can even set a reminder on your phone to help you make it a habit. Remember, the goal isn't to ignore or discount the challenges you face, but rather to create a more balanced perspective by also acknowledging your strengths and successes.\n\nPatient: I'll give it a try. It's just hard sometimes when the negative thoughts feel so overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: I understand. That's why we're working on building up your toolkit of skills, like the thought records and distress tolerance techniques. These tools can help you manage those overwhelming thoughts and feelings when they arise.\n\nPatient: Yeah, I have been using the deep breathing and grounding exercises when I start to feel really anxious. They do help a bit in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear! It's all about finding what works for you and practicing those skills regularly. And remember, progress isn't always linear. There will be ups and downs, but what matters is that you keep showing up for yourself and putting in the effort.\n\nPatient: Thanks, I'll keep trying. I know it's not going to be easy, but I'm committed to working on this.\n\nTherapist: Your commitment and willingness to engage in this process are huge strengths, Alex. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Now, let's take a moment to check in on your progress with the other skills we've been working on. How has the behavioral activation been going? Have you been able to engage in some of those value-aligned activities we discussed, like gardening or socializing with a friend?\n\nPatient: I did spend some time in my garden over the weekend, which was nice. It felt good to be outside and focus on something other than work and my thoughts. But I haven't reached out to any friends yet. I keep putting it off.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you were able to spend some time gardening. That's a step in the right direction. As for reaching out to friends, that can be challenging, especially when you're feeling down. Let's explore what might be getting in the way of taking that step.",
