  "transcript": "Patient: That makes a lot of sense. I can see how those types of thoughts could be distorting my view of myself and my situation.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Alex. Recognizing these cognitive distortions is an important first step in CBT. By identifying and challenging these negative thought patterns, we can start to shift your perspective and improve your emotional well-being. How do you feel about setting a goal related to identifying and challenging cognitive distortions?\n\nPatient: I think that would be a good goal for me. It's something I can work on between sessions, and hopefully, it will help me start to feel better.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Alex. Setting goals is an essential part of CBT because it helps us stay focused and motivated throughout the therapy process. In addition to identifying and challenging cognitive distortions, are there any other goals you'd like to work on in therapy?\n\nPatient: I'd like to work on finding healthier coping mechanisms for when I'm feeling overwhelmed or triggered to use substances. And maybe also work on building stronger connections with my friends and family.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent goals, Alex. We can definitely work on developing healthier coping strategies and improving your relationships. In fact, homework assignments are a key component of CBT, as they allow you to practice the skills we discuss in therapy in your daily life. Would you be open to trying some homework assignments related to your goals?\n\nPatient: I'm willing to give it a try. I know I need to put in the work if I want to see changes in my life.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Alex. Homework assignments can be incredibly beneficial in reinforcing the concepts we discuss in therapy and helping you make progress towards your goals. We'll work together to develop assignments that feel manageable and relevant to your specific needs.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm looking forward to seeing how CBT can help me.\n\nTherapist: I'm excited to continue working with you, Alex. Before we move on, I want to check in with how you're feeling about the concepts we've discussed so far. Do you have any questions or concerns about cognitive distortions or setting goals in therapy?",
