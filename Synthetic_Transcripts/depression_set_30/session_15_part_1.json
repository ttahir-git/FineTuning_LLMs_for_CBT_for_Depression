  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 15. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about that. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the behavioral experiments and self-compassion exercises. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I still find myself getting stuck in negative thought patterns, especially when it comes to work and my relationships.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on the techniques we discussed, Alex. It's completely normal to face challenges and setbacks along the way. What you're experiencing is a part of the process, and it's great that you're able to recognize those negative thought patterns. Today, I'd like to focus on exploring those thoughts further and discussing how we can continue to challenge them. We can also touch on your progress with the behavioral experiments and self-compassion exercises. How does that sound for our agenda today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me, Nova. I'd really like to dive deeper into those negative thoughts and see if we can find ways to reframe them. I'm also curious to hear your thoughts on my progress with the homework assignments.\n\nTherapist: Perfect, Alex. Let's start by discussing your experiences with the behavioral experiments and self-compassion exercises. Can you share some examples of how you've been implementing these techniques and any challenges you've faced?",
