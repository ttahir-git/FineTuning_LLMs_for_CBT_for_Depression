  "transcript": "Therapist: Hi Alex, it's great to see you again. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: I'm doing alright, thanks for asking. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. I'm ready to dive into today's session.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by setting an agenda for today's session. We'll review your homework from last week, discussing the thought records you kept and identifying any patterns or themes that emerged. Then, we'll start exploring the CBT framework, focusing on the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We'll also begin to explore your specific thought patterns related to your depression. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm curious to learn more about the CBT framework and how it can help me.\n\nTherapist: Let's start by reviewing your thought records from last week. Were you able to identify any specific thoughts that arose when you were feeling depressed or anxious?",
