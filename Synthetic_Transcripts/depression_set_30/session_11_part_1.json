  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alex, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel that you're in crisis, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your support. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and behavioral activation. I reached out to my friend Sam, and we had a good conversation. It felt nice to connect with someone outside of work. However, I've still been struggling with negative thoughts, especially related to my performance at work and my overall sense of self-worth.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you were able to connect with Sam and that it felt good to have that conversation. It's also important that you're noticing and acknowledging the negative thoughts that are still present. Can you tell me more about the thoughts you've been experiencing related to your work performance and self-worth?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been working on a big project at work, and I can't seem to shake the feeling that I'm not doing enough or that my contributions aren't valuable. Even when I receive positive feedback, I find myself dismissing it and focusing on the negative aspects of my performance. It's like I'm constantly waiting for someone to realize that I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alex. It sounds like you're dealing with some difficult thoughts related to your work performance. I want to explore this further, but first, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize in our time together today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on my negative thoughts related to work and self-worth, as well as strategies for managing them. I also want to discuss how I can continue to build on the progress I've made with behavioral activation and connecting with others.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. Let's start by exploring the negative thoughts you've been experiencing and then move on to discussing strategies for managing them and building on your progress. Does that work for you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. Where should we begin?",
