  "transcript": "Patient: I did notice some patterns in my thoughts. A lot of times, I catch myself thinking things like \"I'm never going to be good enough\" or \"I'll always feel this way.\" It's like I'm stuck in this negative loop.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Alex. Those types of thoughts are what we call cognitive distortions. Cognitive distortions are inaccurate or exaggerated thought patterns that can contribute to negative emotions. Two common types are all-or-nothing thinking and overgeneralization. All-or-nothing thinking is when we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms, like \"I'm never going to be good enough.\" Overgeneralization is when we make broad, generalized conclusions based on a single event or piece of evidence, like \"I'll always feel this way.\" Does that make sense?",
