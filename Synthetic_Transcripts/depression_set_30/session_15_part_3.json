  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's dive into the thought record for the situation you mentioned at work. It's great that you're able to identify those negative thoughts that pop up. Can you walk me through the emotions you felt during that presentation?\n\nPatient: Well, as soon as I stumbled over my words, I felt this wave of anxiety and embarrassment wash over me. My heart started racing, and I could feel my face getting hot. I just wanted to disappear.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a really intense emotional response, Alex. I can imagine how uncomfortable that must have felt in the moment. Let's rate the intensity of those emotions on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most intense. How would you rate your anxiety and embarrassment in that moment?\n\nPatient: Hmm, I'd say the anxiety was at a solid 8, and the embarrassment was probably around a 7.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we've got anxiety at an 8 and embarrassment at a 7. Now, let's look at the specific thoughts that went through your mind. You mentioned thinking \"You're so incompetent, everyone thinks you're an idiot.\" Were there any other thoughts that stood out to you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I also had thoughts like \"I'm going to get fired for sure\" and \"I'll never be successful at this job.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are some pretty harsh thoughts, Alex. I want to point out a cognitive distortion that I'm noticing here, which is catastrophizing. Catastrophizing is when we jump to the worst-case scenario, even if there's no real evidence to support it. Can you see how these thoughts might be an example of that?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I guess you're right. I don't have any actual evidence that I'm going to get fired or that I'll never be successful. It's just my mind going to that extreme place.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And that's why it's so important to pause and examine the evidence for and against these thoughts. Let's do that now. What evidence do you have that supports the thought \"I'm going to get fired for sure\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess stumbling over my words could be seen as evidence. And I've been feeling like I'm not meeting expectations lately.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we've got the stumbling and your perception of not meeting expectations. Now, let's look at the evidence against that thought. Have you received any direct feedback from your supervisor indicating that your job is in jeopardy?\n\nPatient: No, I haven't. My boss actually complimented my work on a project last week.\n\nTherapist: That's important to consider. What about your past performance evaluations? Have they been generally positive?\n\nPatient: Yeah, for the most part. I've had some areas for improvement, but overall, my evaluations have been good.\n\nTherapist: So, it seems like we have some pretty strong evidence against the thought that you're going to get fired. Now, let's see if we can come up with an alternative thought that's more balanced and based on the evidence. What do you think might be a more realistic way to view the situation?\n\nPatient: I guess a more realistic thought would be \"Stumbling over my words doesn't mean I'm going to get fired. I've received positive feedback and evaluations in the past, so one mistake doesn't define my entire career.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Alex! It takes into account the evidence and provides a more balanced perspective. Now, let's re-rate your emotions based on this new thought. How intense does your anxiety feel now on that 1 to 10 scale?\n\nPatient: It's definitely lower. Maybe around a 4 now.\n\nTherapist: And what about the embarrassment?\n\nPatient: That's gone down too, probably to a 3.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic progress, Alex. This is a great example of how challenging our thoughts can have a direct impact on our emotions. It's not about ignoring the negative thoughts or trying to force positivity. It's about examining the evidence and coming up with a more balanced perspective.\n\nPatient: I can see how that works. It's just hard to do in the moment when those thoughts are so loud and overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Alex. It takes practice to be able to catch those thoughts and challenge them in real-time. That's why we start by practicing with situations that have already happened, like we just did. Over time, it becomes easier to apply these skills in the moment. And that's where the behavioral experiments come in too - they help us gather evidence to challenge those negative predictions before they even happen.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I definitely want to keep working on this.",
