  "transcript": "Patient: I guess there have been a few times when people have invited me to lunch or asked for my opinion on something. It's just hard to focus on those moments when the negative ones feel so much louder.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Alex. Our brains have a negativity bias, which means we tend to focus more on negative experiences than positive ones. It's like wearing a pair of glasses that filters out the positive and magnifies the negative. But just because we don't see the positive doesn't mean it's not there. It's our job to actively look for evidence that challenges our negative thoughts.\n\nLet's do an experiment. I want you to close your eyes and imagine yourself in that situation again, standing with your coworkers. This time, instead of focusing on the negative thoughts, I want you to focus on any positive or neutral evidence. What do you notice?\n\nPatient: Well, no one was outright ignoring me or giving me dirty looks. And when I have spoken up in the past, people have listened and responded. It's just hard to remember those moments when I'm feeling anxious.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. Anxiety can make it difficult to access positive memories. That's why it's helpful to write down evidence that challenges your negative thoughts, so you can refer back to it when you're feeling doubtful.\n\nLet's look at the emotions you experienced in that situation. You mentioned feeling sad, anxious, and lonely. What do you think would happen to those emotions if you were able to focus on the positive or neutral evidence in the moment?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel less anxious and lonely. I might still feel a bit sad or awkward, but it wouldn't be as intense.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Challenging negative thoughts can help reduce the intensity of negative emotions. It doesn't mean the emotions will disappear completely, but they become more manageable.\n\nNow, let's explore how challenging those negative thoughts could impact your behavior. If you were able to focus on the positive or neutral evidence, how might you have behaved differently in that situation?\n\nPatient: I might have tried to join in the conversation, even if it was just to ask a question or make a small comment. I wouldn't have left the room so quickly.\n\nTherapist: So, challenging the negative thoughts could lead to more engaged, less avoidant behavior. That's an important connection. Our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. By changing one, we can impact the others.\n\nI want to acknowledge that this is hard work, Alex. Challenging negative thoughts and changing behaviors takes practice and persistence. But every small step counts. Every time you catch a negative thought and look for evidence to challenge it, you're building a new habit. Every time you choose to engage instead of avoid, you're strengthening your resilience.\n\nWhat do you think about setting a small goal related to this? Maybe challenging yourself to speak up once in a group setting at work this week, even if it's just to ask a question or make a comment?\n\nPatient: That sounds scary, but I think it's a good idea. I'll try to challenge myself to speak up at least once.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Alex. Remember, it doesn't have to be perfect. The important thing is that you're trying. And we can discuss how it went at our next session.\n\nI also want to encourage you to continue practicing the other skills we've discussed, like behavioral activation and self-compassion. These skills work together to help you build a more balanced and resilient mindset.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: No, I think I understand. It's just a matter of putting it into practice, which is the hard part.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Putting these skills into practice is the hardest part, but also the most important. That's why we take it one step at a time, and celebrate every small victory along the way.\n\nRemember, you don't have to do this alone. I'm here to support you, and we can problem-solve any challenges that come up together. You're making great progress, Alex, even if it doesn't always feel that way.",
