  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that comes to mind is when my daughter asked me to babysit my grandchildren last weekend. I had planned to spend that time painting, as we discussed in our last session. I felt guilty saying no to her, even though I knew I needed that time for myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Fatima. It's understandable that you felt guilty in that situation. Let's explore this further. What thoughts went through your mind when your daughter asked you to babysit?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"If I say no, she'll think I don't care about her or my grandchildren. I should put their needs before my own.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are quite common in situations like this. They reflect some of the intermediate and core beliefs we've identified, such as \"I should always put others' needs before my own\" and \"If I set boundaries or prioritize my own needs, I'm being selfish and disappointing others.\" Let's examine the evidence for and against these thoughts using a thought record.\n\nPatient: Okay, I remember doing this in our previous sessions. It was helpful to see things from a different perspective.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start with the evidence that supports the thought \"If I say no, she'll think I don't care about her or my grandchildren.\" What evidence do you have for this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I know my daughter relies on me for help with the kids. She's always expressing how much she appreciates my support. I worry that if I say no, she'll feel like I'm not there for her when she needs me.\n\nTherapist: That's valid. Now, let's consider the evidence against this thought. Have there been times when you've said no to requests, and your daughter still felt cared for?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. There was a time when I couldn't babysit because I had a doctor's appointment. My daughter was understanding and told me not to worry about it. She knows I love her and the kids.\n\nTherapist: That's an important piece of evidence against the thought. It shows that your daughter can understand and respect your needs, even when you have to say no. Let's look at the second thought, \"I should put their needs before my own.\" What evidence do you have for this thought?\n\nPatient: As a mother and grandmother, I feel like it's my responsibility to be there for my family whenever they need me. I don't want to let them down.\n\nTherapist: That's a common belief many people hold. However, it's essential to recognize that putting your own needs first at times is not selfish\u2014it's necessary for your well-being. Have there been instances where prioritizing your needs actually benefited your family in the long run?\n\nPatient: I suppose taking care of my health and managing my depression is important for my family too. If I'm not in a good place mentally, it's harder for me to be there for them.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! By taking care of yourself, you're actually investing in your ability to support your loved ones in the long term. It's not selfish; it's self-care. Now, let's develop an alternative thought based on the evidence we've discussed.\n\nPatient: How about, \"It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize my needs sometimes. My daughter understands, and taking care of myself benefits my family in the long run.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought! It acknowledges the importance of self-care while still considering your family's needs. How does this new perspective make you feel about the situation?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit lighter, actually. It's a relief to know that setting boundaries doesn't mean I'm letting my family down.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Fatima. Remember, it takes practice to challenge long-held beliefs, but with time, it becomes easier to recognize and reframe them. I encourage you to continue using thought records to examine the evidence for and against distressing thoughts.",
