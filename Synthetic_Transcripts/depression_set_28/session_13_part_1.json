  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Fatima, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like deep breathing and thought records. I've noticed some improvement in my ability to manage my emotions, but I still struggle with feelings of guilt when it comes to setting boundaries and prioritizing my own needs.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements. It's also understandable that setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs can still be challenging. We can definitely explore that further today. Before we dive in, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to discuss my experiences with setting boundaries and how I can manage the guilt that comes with it. I also want to talk about how I can continue to challenge my negative thoughts and core beliefs.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on. Let's add them to our agenda. We can start by discussing your experiences with setting boundaries and exploring ways to manage the guilt. Then, we can review your thought records and work on challenging negative thoughts and core beliefs. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds perfect.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's start with your experiences in setting boundaries. Can you share a specific situation where you tried to set a boundary and how it made you feel?\n\nPatient: Last week, I decided to set aside an evening for myself to paint, as we discussed in our previous session. I informed my family that I needed some time alone to focus on my hobby. At first, they were understanding, but then my daughter called me, asking for help with her kids. I felt guilty for saying no and ended up spending the evening helping her instead.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that you felt guilty in that situation. It's common for people to feel guilty when they start setting boundaries, especially if they're used to putting others' needs before their own. Let's explore this further. What thoughts went through your mind when your daughter called?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I should be there for my family whenever they need me. If I don't help, I'm being selfish and disappointing them.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Fatima. I can see how those thoughts contribute to your feelings of guilt. Let's examine the evidence for and against those thoughts using the examining the evidence technique we've practiced before. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you should always be there for your family, no matter what?",
