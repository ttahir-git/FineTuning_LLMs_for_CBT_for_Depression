  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that stands out is when I received a call from my daughter. She was upset about a problem at work and needed someone to talk to. I immediately felt anxious and started thinking that I had to drop everything to help her, even though I was in the middle of a painting session.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to explore further. Let's break this down using a thought record. What emotions did you experience during this situation, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I felt anxious, with an intensity of about 80. I also felt guilty, with an intensity of around 70, for not being immediately available to help my daughter.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you identified anxiety and guilt as the primary emotions. Now, let's look at the automatic thoughts that contributed to these emotions. What was going through your mind when you received the call from your daughter?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I'm being selfish for painting while my daughter is struggling,\" and \"A good mother should always be available for her children, no matter what.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are powerful thoughts that tie into the core belief we've discussed before: \"I should always put others' needs before my own.\" Let's examine the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence supports the idea that you're being selfish for painting while your daughter is struggling?\n\nPatient: Well, my daughter was upset and needed support, and I was doing something for myself instead of being immediately available to her.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence goes against the idea that you're being selfish?\n\nPatient: I suppose that taking time for myself doesn't necessarily mean I'm being selfish. I can still be there for my daughter while also engaging in activities that I enjoy and that help me manage my depression.\n\nTherapist: That's an important point. Self-care is not selfish; it's necessary for your overall well-being. What about the thought, \"A good mother should always be available for her children, no matter what.\" What evidence supports this thought?\n\nPatient: I've always believed that a mother's primary responsibility is to her children, and that means being there for them whenever they need me.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence goes against this thought?\n\nPatient: I know that it's not realistic or healthy for me to be available 24/7. My children are grown, and they need to develop their own problem-solving skills. Constantly dropping everything for them might not be the best way to support their growth and independence.\n\nTherapist: You make a valid point. It's essential to strike a balance between being supportive and fostering independence. Based on the evidence you've provided, what would be a more balanced and realistic alternative thought?\n\nPatient: Perhaps something like, \"It's okay for me to take time for myself, and I can still be a supportive mother without being constantly available. My daughter's ability to problem-solve independently is important for her growth.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and adaptive way of looking at the situation. How do you think this alternative thought would impact your emotions?\n\nPatient: I believe my anxiety and guilt would be less intense. Maybe around 50 instead of 80 and 70.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in emotional intensity. This example demonstrates how challenging our automatic thoughts and finding more balanced alternatives can help us manage our emotions more effectively. Let's continue to practice this skill with other situations you encountered this week.\n\nPatient: I'd like that. It's helpful to break down my thoughts and emotions in this way. I'm starting to see how my thoughts influence my feelings and behaviors.",
