  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you reminding me that progress is the goal, not perfection. It's easy for me to forget that when I'm feeling discouraged.\n\nTherapist: It's a common challenge, and it's something we'll continue to work on together. Remembering that progress is the goal can help you maintain a more compassionate and realistic perspective. Speaking of progress, let's explore how the skills we've been practicing can be applied to the challenges you're facing with boundary-setting and managing guilt. Can you tell me about a recent situation where you struggled with setting boundaries or felt guilty for prioritizing your own needs?\n\nPatient: Last week, my daughter asked me to babysit my grandchildren on a day when I had planned to spend some time painting. I wanted to say no, but I felt guilty about putting my own needs first. I ended up agreeing to babysit, but I felt resentful and frustrated with myself for not setting a boundary.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, and it's a common struggle for many people, especially those who are used to putting others' needs before their own. Let's break down this situation using the CBT triangle, which explores the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. What thoughts were going through your mind when your daughter asked you to babysit?\n\nPatient: I thought that if I said no, she would be disappointed in me and think I don't care about my grandchildren. I also thought that a good mother and grandmother should always be available for her family, no matter what.\n\nTherapist: And what emotions did those thoughts trigger?\n\nPatient: I felt guilty, anxious, and a bit sad. I was worried about letting my daughter down and not living up to my own expectations of being a good mother and grandmother.\n\nTherapist: Given those thoughts and feelings, what behavior did you choose?\n\nPatient: I agreed to babysit, even though I had planned to spend that time painting. I put my own needs aside to avoid disappointing my daughter and to live up to my own standards.\n\nTherapist: This is a clear example of how our thoughts and feelings can influence our behaviors. The guilt and anxiety you felt made it difficult for you to set a boundary and prioritize your own needs. Let's look at this situation again, but this time, let's challenge some of those thoughts and explore alternative behaviors. When you thought \"a good mother and grandmother should always be available for her family, no matter what,\" what cognitive distortion might be at play there?\n\nPatient: That sounds like an example of \"should\" statements again. I was putting pressure on myself to meet an unrealistic expectation.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! \"Should\" statements can make it very difficult to set healthy boundaries and prioritize our own needs. What might be a more balanced thought in this situation?\n\nPatient: A more balanced thought could be \"It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize my own needs sometimes. Being a good mother and grandmother doesn't mean I have to be available all the time.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more compassionate and realistic perspective. If you had approached the situation with that thought in mind, how might your feelings and behavior have been different?\n\nPatient: I might have felt less guilty and anxious about saying no. I could have explained to my daughter that I had already made plans to spend that time painting, but that I would be happy to babysit on another day.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a healthy and assertive way to set a boundary while still showing care for your family. Remember, setting boundaries isn't about rejecting others; it's about communicating your needs and finding a balance that works for everyone. As we continue to practice challenging cognitive distortions and setting boundaries, it will become easier to prioritize your own needs without feeling guilty.",
