  "transcript": "Patient: When I think about setting boundaries with my family, I feel guilty and anxious. I worry that they'll think I'm selfish or that I don't care about them. I often end up putting their needs before my own, even when it's at the expense of my own well-being.\n\nTherapist: Those are common concerns when it comes to setting boundaries with loved ones, Fatima. It's understandable to feel guilty or worried about how others might perceive you. Let's explore these thoughts further. What do you think might happen if you were to prioritize your own needs and set boundaries with your family?\n\nPatient: I'm afraid that they'll be disappointed in me or that they'll think I'm not a good daughter or sister. I worry that they'll pull away from me or that our relationships will suffer.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid concerns, Fatima. It's common to worry about how setting boundaries might impact our relationships. However, it's important to recognize that setting healthy boundaries is actually a sign of self-respect and can lead to more positive and mutually fulfilling relationships in the long run. Let's practice reframing some of these thoughts. What might be an alternative way to view setting boundaries with your family?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could view it as taking care of myself so that I can show up more fully in my relationships. If I'm constantly drained and resentful, I'm not able to be the best daughter or sister anyway.\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Fatima. Setting boundaries is a form of self-care, and it actually allows you to show up more authentically and positively in your relationships. Another way to reframe it might be to recognize that setting boundaries is a way of communicating your needs and expectations clearly, which can lead to greater understanding and respect in your relationships.\n\nPatient: I like that way of looking at it. It feels more empowering and less selfish.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Setting boundaries is not selfish; it's an act of self-respect and an important part of maintaining healthy relationships. Let's practice how you might communicate a boundary with a family member. Can you think of a specific situation where you might need to set a boundary?\n\nPatient: Yes, my sister often asks me to babysit her kids at the last minute, and I usually say yes even if I had other plans. I could practice setting a boundary there.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Fatima. Let's role-play how you might communicate that boundary assertively. I'll play the role of your sister, and you can practice responding. Remember to use \"I\" statements and be clear and direct about your needs.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll give it a try. \"Sister, I know you need help with the kids, but I had plans tonight that I need to keep. I'm happy to help out another time if you give me more notice.\"\n\nTherapist: That was great, Fatima! You were clear and direct about your needs while also showing empathy for your sister's situation. How did that feel?\n\nPatient: It felt a bit uncomfortable, but also empowering. I can see how being direct and clear can actually be more helpful than beating around the bush or saying yes when I don't mean it.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Being direct and assertive shows respect for yourself and others, and it can lead to more positive outcomes in the long run. As you continue to practice setting boundaries, it will start to feel more natural and comfortable.\n\nPatient: I'm definitely going to keep practicing. I can see how this could make a big difference in my relationships and my overall well-being.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Fatima. Setting boundaries is a skill that takes practice, but it's well worth the effort.
