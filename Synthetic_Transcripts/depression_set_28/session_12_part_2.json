  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned that you found the deep breathing exercises helpful, even if the effects were temporary. That's great to hear. Can you tell me more about when you found yourself using this technique and how it impacted your stress or anxiety levels in those moments?\n\nPatient: I used the deep breathing exercises mostly when I felt overwhelmed at work or when I couldn't sleep at night due to racing thoughts. It helped me feel calmer and more centered, even if it was just for a short while. I think I need to practice it more consistently though.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful insight, Fatima. Consistency is key when it comes to these techniques. The more you practice, the more natural it will become, and the more effective it will be in managing your stress and anxiety. Let's talk about the thought records you completed this week. Can you share an example of a situation where you used this tool and how it helped you identify and challenge negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: One situation that stands out is when my daughter called to cancel our plans for the weekend. My initial thought was that she didn't want to spend time with me, and I felt really sad and rejected. But when I examined the evidence, I realized she had a valid reason - she had to work unexpectedly. It helped me reframe the situation and not take it so personally.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent example of how thought records can help us challenge our initial negative thoughts and find alternative, more balanced perspectives. By examining the evidence, you were able to see the situation more objectively and not jump to conclusions based on your emotions. This is a crucial skill in managing depressive symptoms.\n\nPatient: It's not easy to catch those negative thoughts in the moment, but I'm getting better at it. I still struggle with feelings of guilt when I try to set boundaries or prioritize my own needs though.\n\nTherapist: Guilt is a common emotion that many people experience when they start setting boundaries, especially if they're used to putting others' needs before their own. Can you give me an example of a situation where you felt guilty for setting a boundary?\n\nPatient: Last week, my friend asked me to babysit her kids, but I had planned to spend that evening painting, which I haven't done in a long time. I said no, but I felt guilty about it for days, thinking I was being selfish.\n\nTherapist: I understand how that situation could bring up feelings of guilt, especially given your long-held belief that you should always put others' needs before your own. However, it's important to recognize that setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs is not selfish \u2013 it's an act of self-care. Let's explore this further using the downward arrow technique. If you believe that setting boundaries is selfish, what does that mean about you as a person?",
