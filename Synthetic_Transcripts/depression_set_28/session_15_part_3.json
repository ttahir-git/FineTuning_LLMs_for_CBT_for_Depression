  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you acknowledging the difficulty in processing these emotions. It's not easy to face the pain and sadness head-on.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it's not easy at all. But by giving yourself permission to feel and express your emotions, you can begin to heal and find a sense of peace. One way to do this is through journaling. Writing about your experiences and emotions can help you process them in a safe and private way.\n\nPatient: I used to journal when I was younger, but I haven't done it in years. I think it could be helpful to start again.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're open to trying journaling again. You can start by setting aside a few minutes each day to write about your thoughts and feelings related to your husband's passing and your military experiences. Don't worry about grammar or structure, just let your thoughts flow onto the page.\n\nPatient: I can do that. I'll try to write a little bit each day and see how it feels.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. Remember, journaling is a personal experience, and there's no right or wrong way to do it. It's about giving yourself a safe space to express your emotions and process your experiences.\n\nAs we continue to work on managing your rumination and processing your emotions, I want you to keep in mind that healing is a journey, and it takes time. Be patient and compassionate with yourself, just as you would be with a dear friend who was going through a difficult time.\n\nPatient: I'll try to remember that. It's hard not to get frustrated with myself sometimes, but I know that being kind to myself is important.\n\nTherapist: It is hard, but with practice, it gets easier. Speaking of practice, let's talk about some homework assignments for the coming week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought stopping and worry time techniques we discussed today. I'd also like you to try journaling for a few minutes each day, focusing on your emotions related to your husband's passing and your military experiences.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I'll do my best to practice these techniques and journal each day.\n\nTherapist: I'm confident that you'll find these tools helpful in managing your rumination and processing your emotions. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns, you can always bring them up in our next session.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your support and guidance.",
