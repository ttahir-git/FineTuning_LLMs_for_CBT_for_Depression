  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned that setting boundaries has been challenging for you since our last session. Can you tell me more about a specific situation where you tried to set a boundary and how it went?\n\nPatient: Well, last week my daughter asked me to babysit my grandchildren on short notice. I had plans to spend that evening painting, which I haven't done in a while, but I felt guilty saying no. I ended up canceling my painting plans and watched the kids instead.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. It's a great opportunity for us to explore the thoughts and feelings that came up for you in that situation. Let's start with the thoughts. What was going through your mind when your daughter asked you to babysit?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"I should help my daughter out. She needs me.\" And then I thought, \"It would be selfish of me to prioritize painting over my grandchildren.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you had the thought \"I should help my daughter out\" and \"It would be selfish of me to prioritize painting over my grandchildren.\" Those thoughts are closely tied to the feelings of guilt you mentioned. Let's explore those thoughts a bit further. What do you think might be the consequence of saying no to your daughter in that situation?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm afraid that she'll be disappointed in me or think I don't care about her or my grandchildren.\n\nTherapist: That's a common fear when it comes to setting boundaries \u2013 the fear of disappointing others or being judged. Let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. Has your daughter ever expressed disappointment or judgment when you've set boundaries in the past?\n\nPatient: Well, now that I think about it, there have been times when I've said no to requests, and she's been understanding. It's just hard for me to remember those times in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. Our fears can be very convincing, even if the evidence doesn't always support them. Another question to consider is, what message are you sending to your daughter and grandchildren if you always put their needs above your own?\n\nPatient: I guess I might be teaching them that it's not okay to prioritize their own needs and well-being.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By setting boundaries and modeling self-care, you're actually teaching them a valuable lesson about the importance of taking care of oneself. It's not selfish \u2013 it's an act of self-respect and self-compassion. How do you feel about the situation now, after examining the evidence and considering the bigger picture?\n\nPatient: I can see how setting boundaries is important, not just for me, but for my family too. It's still hard, but I feel a bit more motivated to practice setting small boundaries, like keeping my painting plans next time.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Fatima. Remember, setting boundaries is a skill that takes practice. Start small and be patient with yourself. It's okay if it feels uncomfortable at first \u2013 that discomfort is a sign of growth and change. Speaking of painting, let's talk more about your goal of reconnecting with your passions. What do you think has been getting in the way of you engaging in painting and other activities you enjoy?",
