  "transcript": "Patient: I like that idea of setting aside one evening a week for painting. It feels manageable, and I think it will help me start prioritizing my own needs more consistently.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find that plan helpful, Fatima. Remember, starting small and being consistent is key. As you continue to practice setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs, it will become easier over time. Now, before we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on your current mood and see if you have any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful after our discussion today. I know it won't be easy to change these long-held beliefs, but I feel like I have a better understanding of why it's important to prioritize my own needs sometimes. I'm still a bit nervous about setting boundaries with others, but I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel nervous about setting boundaries, especially when it's something new for you. Remember, it's okay to start small and build up gradually. And don't hesitate to reach out for support if you need it. I'm here to help you through this process.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your support. I think I'm ready to start working on this homework assignment and see how it goes.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Fatima.
