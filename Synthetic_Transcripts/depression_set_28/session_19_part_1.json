  "transcript": "Therapist: Welcome back, Fatima! It's great to see you for our 19th session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been practicing the responsibility pie technique, and it's been helpful in challenging my feelings of excessive responsibility and self-blame. I also reached out to Layla and offered my support, which felt like a positive step. However, I still find myself struggling with those negative thoughts at times.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the responsibility pie technique and reaching out to support Layla. These are significant steps in your journey. It's also normal to experience setbacks and challenges along the way. Can you tell me more about the situations where you found yourself struggling with negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: Well, I had a conversation with my son, and he mentioned that he's been feeling overwhelmed with work and family responsibilities. I immediately started thinking that I should have done more to prepare him for these challenges, and that his struggles are somehow my fault.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Fatima. It's a great example of how our negative core beliefs can influence our thoughts and reactions. Let's explore this further. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you are responsible for your son's current challenges?\n\nPatient: When I really think about it, there isn't much evidence to support that idea. My son is an adult, and he's made his own choices in life. I know I did my best to raise him with love and support, but I can't control everything that happens to him.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Fatima. You're recognizing that there are many factors beyond your control, and that you are not solely responsible for the outcomes in your son's life. This is a key part of challenging that negative core belief we've been working on. Remember, just because you have a thought doesn't mean it's true. Let's continue to gather evidence to support your new, adaptive core belief.\n\nPatient: You're right, Nova. It's just hard to break out of that pattern of thinking sometimes. I feel like I've been carrying this sense of responsibility for so long.\n\nTherapist: I understand, Fatima. Changing long-held beliefs is a process, and it takes time and practice. Remember the coping cards we created in our last session? They can be a helpful tool to remind yourself of your new, adaptive beliefs when you find yourself slipping into old patterns of thinking. Have you had a chance to use them?\n\nPatient: Yes, I have. I created a few more cards with messages that resonate with me, like \"I am not responsible for everything that happens to my loved ones\" and \"I can support and love my family without taking on their challenges as my own.\" I've been keeping them in my purse and reading them when I need a reminder.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Fatima! Using the coping cards is a great way to reinforce your new beliefs and support yourself when you're facing challenges. I'm proud of you for taking that initiative. Now, let's take a look at the agenda for today's session. We have a few items to cover:\n\n1. Review your experience with practicing the responsibility pie technique and creating coping cards\n2. Discuss the outcome of the core belief experiment and explore any evidence gathered to challenge the negative core belief\n3. Continue to develop your wellness action plan and discuss strategies for maintaining progress after therapy\n4. Introduce additional cognitive restructuring techniques to further challenge feelings of excessive responsibility\n\nDoes this agenda work for you, or is there anything else you'd like to add?",
