  "transcript": "Patient: Setting boundaries has been a real challenge for me, Nova. I feel like I'm letting people down when I say no or prioritize my own needs. It goes against everything I've been taught about being a good person and putting others first.\n\nTherapist: I understand how difficult it can be to set boundaries, especially when it feels like it goes against your values and beliefs. It's common to feel guilty or like you're letting others down when you start prioritizing your own needs. However, it's important to recognize that setting boundaries is not selfish. It's a way of taking care of yourself so that you can be there for others in a healthier and more sustainable way.\n\nPatient: I know you're right, but it's hard to shake that feeling of guilt. I worry that people will think I'm being selfish or that they'll be disappointed in me.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, Fatima. It's natural to worry about how others will perceive you when you start setting boundaries. However, it's essential to remember that you can't control how others react, but you can control how you respond to their reactions. People who truly care about you will understand and respect your boundaries.\n\nLet's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a situation where you struggled to set a boundary recently?\n\nPatient: Well, last week my friend asked me to babysit her kids on short notice. I had plans to spend the evening painting, which I haven't done in months, but I felt guilty saying no. I ended up canceling my plans and watching her kids, but I felt resentful and frustrated afterward.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Fatima. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle. What thoughts and emotions came up for you when your friend asked you to babysit?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"If I say no, she'll think I'm a bad friend\" and \"I should always be available to help others.\" I felt guilty for even considering saying no and anxious about disappointing her.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts and emotions are understandable given your core belief about always putting others' needs before your own. However, I want to challenge the idea that saying no makes you a bad friend. Is it possible that setting boundaries and taking care of yourself can actually make you a better friend in the long run?\n\nPatient: I guess so. If I'm constantly putting others' needs before my own, I'll end up feeling resentful and burned out. That's not good for any relationship.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Setting boundaries allows you to show up as your best self in your relationships. It's not selfish to prioritize your own needs and well-being. Let's practice reframing the situation using more balanced and realistic thoughts.\n\nInstead of thinking, \"If I say no, she'll think I'm a bad friend,\" you could say, \"Saying no to babysitting doesn't make me a bad friend. I can find another time to support her that works better for me.\"\n\nAnd instead of thinking, \"I should always be available to help others,\" you could say, \"It's okay to prioritize my own needs sometimes. I can't pour from an empty cup.\"\n\nHow do those alternative thoughts feel?\n\nPatient: They feel more balanced and less extreme. I guess I don't have to be available 24/7 to be a good friend.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Fatima. I'm glad those alternative thoughts resonate with you. As we continue to practice reframing and challenging cognitive distortions, it will become easier to set boundaries without feeling guilty.\n\nAnother technique that can be helpful is the Positive Data Log. This involves keeping track of evidence that supports your new, more adaptive beliefs. For example, you could write down instances where you set a boundary and the outcome was positive or neutral, like your friend understanding and respecting your needs.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of having concrete evidence to challenge my negative beliefs about setting boundaries.\n\nTherapist: Great! I'd like to assign that as homework for this week. In addition to practicing the other techniques we've discussed, like deep breathing and thought records, I'd like you to keep a Positive Data Log for boundary-setting. Write down any instances where you set a boundary, how it felt, and the outcome. This will help you accumulate evidence that challenges your old beliefs and supports your new, more adaptive ones.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll give it a try. It's going to be challenging, but I'm willing to work on it.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Fatima. Remember, setting boundaries is a skill that takes practice. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you navigate this process. We'll continue to work on it together in our sessions.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.",
