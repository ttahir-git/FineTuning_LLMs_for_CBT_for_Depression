  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Fatima, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few limitations as your AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate or not fully aligned with your experiences. I also want to remind you that as an AI, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services in your area. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and emotions openly through your messages. With that said, how have you been since our last session? How has your mood been, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the responsibility pie technique when I notice myself feeling excessively responsible or blaming myself for things that have happened in the past. It's been helpful to break down the situation and see that there are many factors beyond my control. However, I still find myself struggling with letting go of those feelings of responsibility at times. I've also been journaling regularly, which has been a good outlet for processing my emotions. Overall, my mood has been relatively stable, but I still have moments where I feel overwhelmed or sad.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the responsibility pie technique and finding it helpful in managing feelings of excessive responsibility and self-blame. It's a skill that takes time and practice to fully incorporate into your thought process, so it's normal to still have moments where those feelings arise. The key is to continue catching those thoughts and applying the technique to challenge them. I'm also glad to hear that journaling has been a helpful outlet for you in processing your emotions. It's a powerful tool for self-reflection and gaining insight into your thoughts and feelings. \n\nGiven what you've shared, I'd like to propose a few items for our agenda today. First, I'd like to review your experience with the responsibility pie technique in more detail and explore any challenges or successes you've had in applying it. Second, I'd like to introduce a new technique called the \"meta-thought record,\" which will help us examine your thoughts about the therapy process itself and address any concerns or anxieties you may have about our work together. Finally, I'd like to spend some time discussing your progress with reframing your core beliefs and finding more balanced perspectives. How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm particularly interested in discussing the meta-thought record, as I've been having some thoughts about the therapy process and my progress. I sometimes worry that I'm not making enough progress or that I should be further along in my journey. I'd also like to talk more about reframing my core beliefs, as I know that's a crucial part of my recovery.",
