  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Fatima, it's great to see you again for session 7. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like deep breathing and thought records. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some small improvements in my ability to manage my emotions. However, I've still been struggling with setting boundaries and prioritizing my own needs.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. Building these skills takes time and practice, so it's normal to face challenges along the way. I appreciate you sharing your ongoing struggles with setting boundaries and prioritizing your needs. Let's make sure to address those topics today. How else have you been feeling since our last session?\n\nPatient: I've been feeling a mix of emotions. Some days, I feel a bit more hopeful and motivated, especially after practicing the techniques we've discussed. But other days, I still find myself feeling overwhelmed and guilty, particularly when it comes to setting boundaries with others.\n\nTherapist: It's common to experience a range of emotions, and it's okay to have both good and challenging days. Recognizing and acknowledging these feelings is an important part of the process. We can definitely explore your feelings of guilt and challenges with boundary-setting further today. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for this session?\n\nPatient: I think I'd also like to discuss how I can start reconnecting with my passions, like painting. I've been finding it hard to motivate myself to engage in activities I once enjoyed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great topic to add to our agenda. Reconnecting with your passions can be a powerful way to improve your mood and overall well-being. So, for today's session, it seems like our main priorities are:\n\n1. Exploring your challenges with boundary-setting and managing guilt\n2. Discussing ways to reconnect with your passions, such as painting\n3. Reviewing your progress with the homework assignments and techniques we've covered so far\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or change?",
