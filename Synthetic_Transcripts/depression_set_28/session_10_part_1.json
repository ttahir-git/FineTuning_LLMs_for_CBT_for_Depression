  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Fatima, it's great to see you again for our 10th session. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in your journey towards better mental health. Let's start by checking in \u2013 how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or significant events in your life?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations as an AI. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like deep breathing and thought records. It's been challenging at times, but I do notice some small improvements in my mood. I still struggle with feelings of guilt when prioritizing my own needs, and I haven't been able to set many boundaries yet.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements in your mood, even if they're small. Change takes time, and it's normal to face challenges along the way. I appreciate your honesty about the difficulties you're experiencing with guilt and boundary-setting. Let's make sure to address these topics during our session today.\n\nBefore we dive in, let's set an agenda for our time together. What would you like to prioritize in our session today? I'd also like to review your experience with the homework assignments and explore any challenges or successes related to your therapy goals, particularly in the areas of boundary-setting, managing guilt, and engaging in painting. We can also continue working on challenging cognitive distortions and developing more balanced and realistic thoughts. What are your thoughts on this agenda?",
