  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Fatima, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive into today's agenda, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted friend or family member. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and emotions openly through your words. With that said, how have you been since our last session?",
