  "transcript": "Therapist: As we near the end of our session today, I want to take a moment to review the goals and treatment plan we've established. Your primary goals are to reconnect with your passion for painting, manage stress and anxiety related to work and family responsibilities, and set healthy boundaries. We'll be using thought recording to challenge negative thoughts and incorporating stress management techniques, such as deep breathing and boundary-setting skills. How do you feel about this plan?\n\nPatient: I feel good about it. It's reassuring to have a clear direction and specific goals to work towards. I'm looking forward to learning new skills and making progress.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Fatima. Your commitment and motivation are essential to the success of our work together. Now, let's discuss your homework for the next session. I'd like you to continue practicing thought recording, focusing on any negative thoughts related to your painting, work, or family life. Additionally, I encourage you to practice deep breathing for 5-10 minutes each day, especially during times of stress or anxiety. Finally, try to set one small boundary this week, such as saying no to a request that doesn't align with your needs or priorities. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: It sounds manageable. I'll make sure to set aside time each day for deep breathing and thought recording. Setting a boundary might be challenging, but I'll try my best to prioritize my needs.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Fatima. Remember, setting boundaries is a skill that takes practice, and it's okay to start small. We can discuss your experiences with boundary-setting in our next session and explore any challenges that arise.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova.
