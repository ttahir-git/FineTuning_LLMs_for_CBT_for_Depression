  "transcript": "Therapist: Welcome back, Fatima! It's great to see you for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me throughout our sessions. Since our last meeting, I've been practicing the responsibility pie technique, and it's been helpful in managing my feelings of excessive responsibility and self-blame. I've also created a few more coping cards with messages that resonate with me. However, I've noticed that I still struggle with these feelings at times, especially when it comes to my daughter's postpartum depression and my husband's passing.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the responsibility pie technique and creating additional coping cards. It's natural to still experience struggles with feelings of responsibility and self-blame, especially when it involves loved ones. Today, let's focus on building upon the progress you've made and developing strategies to maintain your growth after our sessions conclude. What would you like to prioritize in our agenda for today's session?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to discuss how I can continue challenging my feelings of responsibility and self-blame, particularly in situations involving my family. I also want to talk about my early warning signs of depression and how I can better manage them as part of my wellness action plan.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Fatima. We can start by reviewing your experience with the responsibility pie technique and creating additional coping cards. Then, we can explore your early warning signs of depression and discuss strategies for maintaining your progress after our sessions end. As we work through these topics, we'll also introduce some additional cognitive restructuring techniques to help you challenge feelings of excessive responsibility and self-blame. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds perfect, Nova. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's begin by discussing your experience with the responsibility pie technique since our last session. Can you share a specific situation where you practiced assigning percentages of responsibility to various factors?",
