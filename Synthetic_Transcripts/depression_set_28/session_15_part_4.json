Before we wrap up, I'd like to do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit drained, but also hopeful. It's not easy to face these challenges, but I know it's necessary for my healing and growth.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel drained after a session like this. You've done some really important work today, and it's okay to take time to rest and recharge. Remember to be kind to yourself and practice self-care.\n\nPatient: I'll try to remember that. Thank you for your support and guidance today.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Fatima. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Before we end our session, let's discuss your homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought stopping and worry time techniques we discussed today. I'd also like you to try journaling for a few minutes each day, focusing on your emotions related to your husband's passing and your military experiences.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I'll do my best to practice these techniques and journal each day.\n\nTherapist: Great. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns, you can always bring them up in our next session. I'm confident that you'll find these tools helpful in managing your rumination and processing your emotions.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Challenging perfectionism and finding joy in the process of learning and growth\n  - Managing rumination related to husband's passing and military experiences\n  - Processing emotions through journaling\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Downward arrow technique to uncover core beliefs underlying perfectionism\n  - Cognitive restructuring to challenge perfectionistic thoughts\n  - Thought stopping and worry time to manage rumination\n  - Journaling to process emotions related to husband's passing and military experiences\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue practicing thought stopping and worry time techniques\n  - Journal for a few minutes each day, focusing on emotions related to husband's passing and military experiences\n  - Practice cognitive restructuring when noticing perfectionistic thoughts\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, and important personal details:\n  - Demonstrated progress in challenging perfectionism and prioritizing own needs\n  - Identified setting boundaries with family as a challenge and practiced assertiveness and clear communication\n  - Struggling with rumination related to husband's passing and military experiences\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Old core belief: \"If I'm not perfect at something, I shouldn't do it at all.\"\n  - New core belief: \"It's okay to engage in activities even if I'm not perfect at them.
