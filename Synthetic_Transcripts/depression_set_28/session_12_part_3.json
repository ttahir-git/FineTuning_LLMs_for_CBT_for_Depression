  "transcript": "Patient: If setting boundaries is selfish, then it means I'm a bad person. It means I'm not living up to the expectations I've always had for myself \u2013 to be caring and selfless.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Fatima. Let's examine this belief further. What do you think it means to be a \"bad person\"? What are the qualities or behaviors that define a \"bad person\" in your mind?\n\nPatient: I guess a bad person is someone who only thinks about themselves, who doesn't care about others' feelings or needs. Someone who is selfish and inconsiderate.\n\nTherapist: That's a helpful definition. Now, let's consider your decision to set a boundary with your friend. Did you make that decision with the intention of hurting your friend or being inconsiderate?\n\nPatient: No, I didn't. I just wanted to have some time for myself, to do something I enjoy. But I still feel like I let her down.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that you feel that way, given your long-held belief about always putting others first. However, I want to point out that setting a boundary and prioritizing your own needs does not necessarily mean you're being selfish or inconsiderate. It's about finding a balance between caring for others and caring for yourself. By taking time for your own interests and well-being, you're actually investing in your ability to be present and supportive of others in the long run.\n\nPatient: I never thought about it that way. It's just hard to break out of this mindset that I've had for so long.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it is hard to change long-held beliefs. That's why we're working on it gradually, using techniques like the downward arrow to uncover the roots of these beliefs and challenge them. Speaking of which, let's look at the Positive Data Log you've been keeping. Can you share some entries where you prioritized your own needs and the outcome was positive or neutral?\n\nPatient: Well, last weekend, I decided to spend some time painting instead of doing the extra chores I had planned. I felt guilty at first, but then I realized that the chores could wait, and I really enjoyed the time I spent being creative. It felt good to do something just for myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example! By prioritizing your own needs and engaging in an activity you enjoy, you were able to experience positive emotions and a sense of fulfillment. This is valuable evidence that challenges your old belief and supports the new, more adaptive belief that it's okay to prioritize your own needs sometimes. Let's continue to build on this by setting a goal for the coming week. What's one small way you can prioritize your own needs or set a boundary, and how can you prepare for any potential feelings of guilt that may arise?\n\nPatient: I think I can start by setting aside one evening a week for my painting, and communicate that to my family and friends. To prepare for the guilt, I can remind myself that taking this time for myself is not selfish, but rather a way to recharge and be more present for others in the long run.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Fatima. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Even small steps towards prioritizing your own needs can make a big difference in your overall well-being. As you continue to practice setting boundaries and challenging your old beliefs, you'll likely find it easier to manage feelings of guilt and build a more balanced lifestyle.",
