  "transcript": "Therapist: Before we begin the responsibility pie exercise, I'd like to take a moment to review your homework from our last session. You mentioned that you practiced the continuum technique when you noticed rumination about your husband's passing or military experiences. Can you share an example of when you used this technique and how it helped you find a more balanced perspective?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I found myself dwelling on the thought that if I had been a better wife, my husband might still be alive. I caught myself going down that rabbit hole and decided to use the continuum technique. I tried to find evidence for and against that thought, and I realized that there were many factors beyond my control, like his illness and the treatments he received. It helped me see that I wasn't solely responsible for his passing.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how the continuum technique can help you find a more balanced perspective, Fatima. You were able to recognize the rumination and challenge the thought by considering evidence for and against it. This is an important skill in managing depressive symptoms. Did you face any challenges while using this technique?\n\nPatient: Sometimes it's hard to come up with evidence against my negative thoughts. When I'm feeling really low, it's like my mind is clouded, and I can only see the negative aspects of a situation. But I'm trying to push through those moments and find alternative perspectives.\n\nTherapist: It's common to struggle with finding evidence against negative thoughts, especially when you're feeling low. The fact that you're pushing through those moments and trying to find alternative perspectives is a testament to your resilience and commitment to your mental health. As we continue practicing these techniques, it will become easier to challenge negative thoughts, even in difficult moments.\n\nPatient: I hope so. I know it's a process, and I'm trying to be patient with myself.\n\nTherapist: Being patient and compassionate with yourself is crucial in this journey, Fatima. Remember, you're learning new skills and challenging long-held beliefs, which takes time and practice. Now, let's move on to the responsibility pie exercise. This technique can help you gain a more balanced perspective on your level of responsibility for events in your life. We'll start by identifying a situation where you feel a sense of excessive responsibility or self-blame.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can think of a situation from my military service. There was a mission where we lost several soldiers, and I've always felt responsible for their deaths because I was part of the team that planned the operation.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Fatima. I can understand why you might feel a sense of responsibility in that situation. To begin the responsibility pie exercise, we'll list all the factors that contributed to the outcome of that mission. This includes your role, as well as external factors like the enemy's actions, the terrain, and the equipment you had available. We'll then assign a percentage to each factor, representing its contribution to the outcome. The goal is to see that your responsibility is just one slice of the pie, rather than the entire pie.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's hard to see past my own role sometimes.\n\nTherapist: It's common to focus on our own role and feel a disproportionate sense of responsibility, especially in traumatic events. By examining all the contributing factors, we can help you develop a more balanced and realistic perspective. Let's start by listing the factors that contributed to the outcome of that mission.",
