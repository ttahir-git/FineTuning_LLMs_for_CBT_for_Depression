  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Fatima, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. Before we dive into today's agenda, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me so far. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like deep breathing and thought records. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and ability to manage negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. Every step counts, and it's great that you're putting in the effort. Can you tell me more about your experience with the homework assignments, particularly the self-compassion exercise we introduced last time?\n\nPatient: The self-compassion exercise was difficult at first because I'm not used to being kind to myself. I often feel guilty for prioritizing my own needs, as if I'm being selfish. However, I tried the exercise a few times, imagining what I would say to a dear friend in the same situation, and it did help me feel a bit more at ease with myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Fatima. Many people struggle with self-compassion because it can feel foreign or even uncomfortable at first, especially if you're used to prioritizing others' needs. The guilt you mentioned is a common barrier, and it's something we can continue to work on together. I'm glad you were able to practice the exercise and find some relief, even if it was challenging. How about the other homework assignments, such as setting boundaries and reframing situations?\n\nPatient: Setting boundaries has been the most difficult for me. I find myself feeling guilty and worried about disappointing others when I try to prioritize my own needs. I did manage to set a small boundary with a friend who often asks for favors, but it was uncomfortable, and I felt anxious afterward. Reframing situations has been a bit easier, and I've been trying to focus on more adaptive perspectives when I notice negative emotions arising.\n\nTherapist: Setting boundaries can be incredibly challenging, especially when it goes against long-held beliefs and patterns. It's normal to feel guilty and anxious at first, but with practice, it will become easier. The fact that you were able to set a small boundary with your friend is a significant step, and I commend you for that. We can continue to work on boundary-setting and finding ways to manage the guilt and anxiety that come with it. I'm also glad to hear that reframing situations has been a bit easier for you. It's a powerful tool for shifting perspective and managing negative emotions.\n\nGiven what you've shared, I'd like to propose the following agenda for today's session:\n\n1. Review your experience with the homework assignments in more detail\n2. Explore any challenges or successes related to your therapy goals, particularly in the areas of boundary-setting, managing guilt, and engaging in self-care\n3. Continue to challenge cognitive distortions and develop more balanced and realistic thoughts\n4. Introduce additional cognitive restructuring techniques, such as the Positive Data Log, to accumulate evidence for new adaptive beliefs\n5. Discuss your experiences with setting boundaries and explore ways to manage feelings of guilt related to prioritizing your own needs\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
