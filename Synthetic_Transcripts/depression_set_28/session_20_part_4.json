You've demonstrated a strong commitment to your mental health and have developed a solid foundation of CBT skills that you can continue to use moving forward.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel more equipped to handle my depression now, and I appreciate all the guidance and support you've provided.\n\nTherapist: Before we end our session, let's assign some homework for you to practice the skills we've discussed today. First, I'd like you to continue practicing the responsibility reappraisal technique whenever you notice feelings of excessive responsibility or self-blame. Second, make an effort to reach out to your support network when you start noticing early warning signs of depression. Finally, prioritize self-care by scheduling specific times for activities like exercise, relaxation techniques, and hobbies you enjoy.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I'll make sure to practice these techniques and prioritize self-care in the coming week.\n\nTherapist: Great! Remember, managing depression is an ongoing process, and it's okay to have setbacks along the way. The important thing is to keep practicing and reaching out for support when needed.\n\nPatient: I understand. Thank you for reminding me of that.\n\nTherapist: How are you feeling now, as we come to the end of our session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling more hopeful and empowered. I know I have the tools and support I need to continue managing my depression.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Fatima. Your progress and dedication to your mental health are truly inspiring. Remember, you have the strength and resilience to face any challenges that come your way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your kind words and all the help you've given me throughout our sessions.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed the patient's experience with the responsibility pie technique and creating additional coping cards\n  - Introduced the responsibility reappraisal technique to further challenge feelings of excessive responsibility and self-blame\n  - Discussed the patient's early warning signs of depression and strategies for managing them as part of the wellness action plan\n  - Explored the patient's feelings of responsibility related to her daughter's postpartum depression and her husband's passing\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Responsibility pie technique: Continued practicing assigning percentages of responsibility to various factors in a situation to challenge feelings of excessive responsibility and self-blame\n  - Coping cards: Reviewed the use of personalized coping cards to reinforce adaptive beliefs and support the patient after therapy\n  - Responsibility reappraisal: Introduced a new technique to examine evidence for and against perceived responsibility and develop a more balanced perspective\n  - Wellness action plan: Discussed strategies for managing early warning signs of depression, such as engaging in activities that promote accomplishment or pleasure, reaching out to support networks, and practicing self-care\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue practicing the responsibility reappraisal technique whenever noticing feelings of excessive responsibility or self-blame\n  - Reach out to support network when starting to notice early warning signs of depression\n  - Prioritize self-care by scheduling specific times for activities like exercise, relaxation techniques, and hobbies\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, and important personal details:\n  - Demonstrated progress in challenging feelings of responsibility and self-blame using the responsibility pie technique and responsibility reappraisal\n  - Recognized the limits of personal responsibility in situations involving loved ones\n  - Identified early warning signs of depression and self-care strategies as part of the wellness action plan\n  - Continues to struggle with feelings of excessive responsibility and self-blame at times, particularly related to her daughter's postpartum depression and her husband's passing\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Old core belief: \"I am responsible for the bad things that have happened to my loved ones.\"\n  - New core belief: \"There are many factors beyond my control, and I am not solely responsible for the outcomes in my life.\"\n  - Intermediate belief: \"If I had done things differently, I could have prevented the losses I've experienced.\"\n  - New intermediate belief: \"There are many factors that contribute to the outcome of events, and I cannot control everything.\"\n\n- Important information to carry forward:\n  - Patient's strengths include resilience, creativity, and dedication to personal growth\n  - Patient may benefit from continued support in challenging feelings of responsibility and self-blame\n  - Patient's progress with reframing core beliefs and finding balanced perspectives should be monitored and built upon in future sessions\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review patient's experience with practicing the responsibility reappraisal technique and prioritizing self-care\n  - Discuss insights and realizations from the patient's reflection on the current session\n  - Continue to develop the patient's wellness action plan and discuss strategies for maintaining progress after therapy\n  - Introduce additional cognitive restructuring techniques to further challenge feelings of excessive responsibility and self-blame",
