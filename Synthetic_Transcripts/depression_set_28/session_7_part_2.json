  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I'm looking forward to discussing these topics further.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your progress with the homework assignments from our last session. How did you find practicing the deep breathing exercises?\n\nPatient: I tried to practice deep breathing every day, especially when I felt stressed or anxious. Some days it was easier than others. When I did manage to do it, I noticed that it helped calm me down a bit, even if the effects didn't last very long.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you noticed some benefits from the deep breathing exercises, even if they were temporary. Building these skills takes practice, and it's normal to have days where it feels more challenging. The fact that you're noticing some calming effects is a positive sign that this technique can be helpful for you. How about the thought records? How did you find completing those?\n\nPatient: I tried to complete at least one thought record each day, focusing on situations where I felt strong negative emotions. It was difficult to catch my negative thoughts in the moment, but when I did, I found it helpful to write them down and challenge them. I'm still working on developing more balanced alternative thoughts, but I think the practice is helping me become more aware of my thought patterns.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Fatima. Recognizing and challenging negative thoughts is a skill that develops with practice. It's okay if it's difficult to catch them in the moment at first. The more you practice, the easier it will become. And even the act of noticing and recording your thoughts can help create some distance between you and the thoughts, making it easier to challenge them over time. Did you face any specific challenges when completing the thought records?\n\nPatient: Sometimes I found it hard to identify the evidence against my negative thoughts. I felt like I was just going in circles, thinking the same negative things over and over again.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge when starting to work with thought records. Our negative thoughts can be very convincing, and it takes practice to start recognizing the evidence against them. One strategy that can be helpful is to imagine that you're talking to a close friend who is in the same situation and having the same thoughts. What would you say to them? Often, we're more compassionate and objective when it comes to other people's thoughts than our own. Another strategy is to ask yourself, \"Is this thought 100% true, 100% of the time?\" Chances are, there are at least some exceptions, even if they're small. Those exceptions can help you start building the case against the negative thought.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to keep those strategies in mind when I'm working on my thought records this week.\n\nTherapist: Great! And remember, the goal isn't to completely get rid of negative thoughts \u2013 everyone has them from time to time. The goal is to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective, so that the negative thoughts don't have as much power over your emotions and behaviors. Now, let's talk about your experiences with setting boundaries since our last session. How did that go?",
