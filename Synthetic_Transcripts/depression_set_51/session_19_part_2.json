  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing the thought record you completed for homework. Can you walk me through the situation you chose to focus on and the automatic thoughts that came up for you?\n\nPatient: Sure. The situation I chose was when I got that lower grade on my paper last week. My automatic thoughts were things like \"I'm not good enough,\" \"I'm going to disappoint my parents,\" and \"I'm going to lose my scholarship.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are really powerful thoughts, and I can imagine they felt very intense in the moment. What emotions did you notice coming up in response to those thoughts?\n\nPatient: I felt really anxious and sad. I also felt guilty, like I had let everyone down.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense. Those thoughts are closely tied to some of the core beliefs we've been working on, like the belief that your worth is tied to your academic performance. What evidence did you come up with to support or refute those automatic thoughts?\n\nPatient: Well, as evidence that supports the thoughts, I guess I could point to the fact that the grade was lower than I expected, and that my parents do have high expectations for me. But as evidence against the thoughts, I tried to remind myself that one grade doesn't define me, and that I've had a lot of academic successes too. I also tried to think about times when my parents have been supportive even when I've struggled.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you were able to come up with evidence on both sides. It's really common for our automatic thoughts to feel really true and convincing in the moment, but when we take a step back and look at the evidence, we often find that they're not the whole story. What was the alternative thought you came up with?\n\nPatient: The alternative thought I came up with was \"One grade doesn't define my worth or my future. I've had a lot of successes, and my parents love and support me even when I struggle.\"\n\nTherapist: I really like that alternative thought. It acknowledges the disappointment of the grade, but it also puts it in perspective and reminds you of your own worth and the support you have. How did your emotions shift after coming up with that alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I still felt a little disappointed, but the anxiety and guilt weren't as strong. I felt a little more hopeful and grounded.\n\nTherapist: That's really significant. Even a small shift in emotion can make a big difference in how we feel and how we approach a situation. And the more we practice generating alternative thoughts, the more natural it will start to feel.",
