  "transcript": "Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate you acknowledging the work I've been putting in. It's not easy, but I do feel like I'm making progress. I'm starting to catch myself when I have those negative thoughts, and I'm trying to challenge them more often.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Aaliyah. I'm really glad to hear that you're noticing progress. It's a great sign that you're starting to catch those negative thoughts and challenge them in the moment. That's a skill that will continue to develop with practice.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, I want to check in with you about your current mood and any final thoughts you have. How are you feeling right now?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling okay. I'm still a bit down, but I feel like I have some new tools to work with. I'm hopeful that with more practice, I'll start to feel better more consistently.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to still feel a bit down, but it's great that you're feeling hopeful about the future. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's normal to have ups and downs. The important thing is that you keep practicing these skills and reaching out for support when you need it.\n\nBefore we end today's session, let's discuss some homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought records, focusing on challenging those negative core beliefs about your worth being tied to your achievements. Try to do at least one thought record per day, and bring them with you to our next session so we can review them together.\n\nI also want you to practice the self-compassion break and continuum technique whenever you notice yourself engaging in all-or-nothing thinking or being overly self-critical. Remember, the goal is to develop more balanced and compassionate ways of thinking about yourself and your experiences.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about the homework?\n\nPatient: No, I think I understand. I'll try to do at least one thought record per day and practice the self-compassion break and continuum technique when I need them.\n\nTherapist: Great. If you have any questions or difficulties with the homework during the week, feel free to reach out. We can always troubleshoot together at our next session.\n\nI want to thank you for your hard work and openness today, Aaliyah. I know this isn't easy, but I'm really proud of the progress you're making. Remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for support if you need it.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll do my best with the homework and see you next week.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Aaliyah. I look forward to seeing you next week. Take care of yourself.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics di",
