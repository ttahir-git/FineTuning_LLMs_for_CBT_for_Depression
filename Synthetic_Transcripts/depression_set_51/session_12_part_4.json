  "transcript": "Therapist: One way to incorporate self-care into your routine is to schedule it just like you would any other important task or responsibility. This can help you prioritize it and make it feel less like something you're doing instead of studying, and more like an essential part of your overall well-being. What are some self-care activities that you enjoy or find helpful?\n\nPatient: I really enjoy photography, and I find it helps me relax and express myself creatively. I also like taking walks in nature, and sometimes I listen to guided meditations before bed.\n\nTherapist: Those are great self-care activities! Let's look at your schedule and see where we can fit them in. It doesn't have to be a huge chunk of time \u2013 even 15-30 minutes a day can make a difference. And remember, self-care isn't selfish. It's necessary for your mental health and overall well-being.\n\nPatient: I guess I could try setting aside some time in the mornings for photography, and maybe take a walk during my lunch break. I can listen to the guided meditations before bed, like I've been doing.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan! I'd also like you to try to be mindful of your self-talk around self-care. If you find yourself feeling guilty or thinking that you should be studying instead, try to challenge those thoughts. Remind yourself that taking care of your mental health is just as important as your academic responsibilities.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's not easy to change those thoughts, but I know it's important.\n\nTherapist: It takes practice, but you're making great progress. Remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself. As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling. What are your main takeaways from our discussion today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful, I think. It's helpful to have a plan for incorporating self-care into my routine, and I'm going to keep working on challenging my negative thoughts. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to keep trying.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful. Remember, change takes time, and there will be ups and downs along the way. The important thing is that you keep making an effort and reaching out for support when you need it.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue working on thought records, focusing on identifying evidence against your negative thoughts and generating alternative thoughts. I also want you to try to incorporate self-care into your daily routine, using the plan we discussed today. Pay attention to your self-talk around self-care, and try to challenge any guilty thoughts that come up.\n\nIn our next session, we can review your thought records and discuss how the self-care plan is going. We can also explore any challenges that come up and continue working on cognitive restructuring techniques.\n\nHere's a summary of today's session:\n\nSession Summary:\n- Reviewed thought records from the past week and discussed challenges with consistency\n- Identified common themes in negative thoughts related to feeling inadequate and not belonging\n- Used downward arrow technique to uncover core belief of being a failure and disappointment\n- Practiced cognitive restructuring using evidence for and against negative thoughts, and generated alternative thoughts\n- Discussed challenges with balancing academic responsibilities and self-care\n- Brainstormed ways to incorporate self-care into daily routine, such as scheduling it and challenging guilty thoughts\n- Checked in on current mood and discussed main takeaways from the session\n\nTechniques used:\n- Thought records\n- Downward arrow technique\n- Cognitive restructuring\n- Scheduling self-care\n- Challenging guilty thoughts\n\nHomework assigned:\n- Continue working on thought records, focusing on evidence against negative thoughts and generating alternative thoughts\n- Incorporate self-care into daily routine using the plan discussed in session\n- Pay attention to self-talk around self-care and challenge guilty thoughts\n\nPatient's progress and challenges:\n- Making progress with identifying negative thoughts and practicing cognitive restructuring\n- Challenging to balance academic responsibilities and self-care\n- Feeling more hopeful after discussing self-care plan and cognitive restructuring techniques\n\nCore beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n- Core belief: \"I'm a failure and a disappointment\"\n- Intermediate belief: \"If I don't perform perfectly academically, I'm letting everyone down\"\n\nPlan for next session:\n- Review thought records and discuss progress with cognitive restructuring\n- Check in on self-care plan and explore any challenges that came up\n- Continue working on cognitive restructuring techniques and challenging core beliefs",
