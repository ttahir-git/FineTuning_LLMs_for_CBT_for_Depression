  "transcript": "Therapist: Aaliyah, I'm glad we had the chance to discuss the challenges you've been facing with the homework and how they relate to your feelings of worthlessness. I want to introduce a technique that can help you practice self-compassion and challenge those negative core beliefs. It's called the \"self-compassion break.\"\n\nPatient: I'm interested in learning more about that. What does it involve?\n\nTherapist: The self-compassion break is a mindfulness exercise that helps you treat yourself with kindness and understanding, especially during difficult moments. It has three main components: mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness.\n\n1. Mindfulness: This involves acknowledging and accepting your thoughts and feelings without judgment. For example, you might say to yourself, \"I'm feeling really down right now, and that's okay.\"\n\n2. Common humanity: This reminds you that everyone struggles and experiences difficult emotions. It helps you feel less alone in your experience. You might tell yourself, \"I'm not the only one who feels this way. Many people struggle with self-criticism and feelings of worthlessness.\"\n\n3. Self-kindness: This involves treating yourself with the same care and understanding you would offer a good friend. You might say something like, \"I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough. I deserve compassion and understanding, even when I'm struggling.\"\n\nPatient: That sounds like a helpful technique. I often forget to be kind to myself, especially when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: It's a common challenge, Aaliyah. Practicing self-compassion can help you build resilience and counteract those negative core beliefs. Would you like to try a self-compassion break together now?\n\nPatient: Sure, I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by thinking of a situation that triggered feelings of worthlessness or self-criticism recently. What's an example that comes to mind?\n\nPatient: Well, the other day I received a lower grade than I expected on a paper I wrote for one of my classes. I immediately started thinking, \"I'm not smart enough to be here\" and \"I'll never succeed in my career if I can't even do well in this class.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Aaliyah. Let's apply the self-compassion break to this situation. First, acknowledge your feelings without judgment. What might you say to yourself?\n\nPatient: I could say, \"I'm feeling really disappointed and frustrated with myself right now, and that's okay. It's normal to feel this way.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great start. Now, remind yourself that you're not alone in this experience. What might you tell yourself about common humanity?\n\nPatient: I could tell myself, \"Many students struggle with self-doubt and disappointment when they don't perform as well as they'd like. I'm not the only one who feels this way.\"\n\nTherapist: Excellent. Finally, offer yourself some words of self-kindness. What might you say to a good friend in this situation?\n\nPatient: I might say, \"You're doing the best you can, and one grade doesn't define your worth or potential. Be gentle with yourself and remember that everyone makes mistakes.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful example of self-kindness, Aaliyah. How did it feel to practice the self-compassion break?\n\nPatient: It felt a little strange at first, but I can see how it could be helpful. It's not easy to be kind to myself, but I'm willing to keep practicing.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Aaliyah. Remember that self-compassion is a skill that takes time to develop, just like any other skill we've been working on in therapy. The more you practice, the more natural it will feel.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely try to incorporate self-compassion breaks into my daily life, especially when I'm feeling down on myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Aaliyah. In addition to the self-compassion break, I want to introduce another technique that can help you challenge your negative core beliefs and build more balanced and adaptive beliefs. It's called the \"continuum technique.\"\n\nPatient: What does that involve?",
