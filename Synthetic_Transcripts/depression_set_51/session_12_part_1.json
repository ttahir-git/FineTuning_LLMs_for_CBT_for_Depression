  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Aaliyah, it's great to see you again for session 12. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement some of the coping strategies we discussed, like journaling and setting aside time for self-care. It's been challenging, but I think it's helping a little bit. I still find myself getting caught up in negative thoughts and feeling overwhelmed at times.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on implementing the coping strategies we discussed. Change takes time, and it's normal to face challenges along the way. Can you tell me more about the negative thoughts you've been experiencing and how they've been impacting you?\n\nPatient: Well, I often find myself thinking that I'm not good enough or that I don't belong here at college. I compare myself to my classmates and feel like I'm falling behind. These thoughts make me feel anxious and unmotivated, and sometimes I just want to give up.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Aaliyah. It sounds like you're dealing with some common cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking and comparing yourself to others. These thoughts can have a significant impact on your emotions and behavior. I'd like to explore this further with you today. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on strategies for managing these negative thoughts and finding ways to stay motivated despite them. I also want to discuss how I can balance my academic responsibilities with taking care of my mental health.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. I'd also like to spend some time reviewing your thought records from the past week and discuss any patterns or insights you've noticed. We can also explore some cognitive restructuring techniques to help you challenge and reframe those negative thoughts. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.",
