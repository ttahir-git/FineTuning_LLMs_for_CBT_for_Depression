Remember, you have all the tools and skills you need to manage your depression and build a fulfilling life. And if you ever need a refresher or some extra support, you can always come back for a booster session. My door is always open.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. That's really comforting to know. I feel like I've learned so much from our work together, and I'm excited to keep using these skills in my daily life.\n\nTherapist: I'm excited for you too, Aaliyah. Before we wrap up, let's take a moment to check in on how you're feeling right now. What's going through your mind and heart as we approach the end of this session?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a mix of emotions, honestly. I'm proud of the progress I've made, but I'm also a little nervous about what comes next. It's like I'm stepping into uncharted territory.\n\nTherapist: That's a really normal and understandable feeling, Aaliyah. Endings can be bittersweet, and it's okay to feel a range of emotions. What do you think might help you feel more grounded and confident as you navigate this transition?\n\nPatient: I think it would help to have a clear plan for how to keep using my skills and supporting myself. Like we talked about earlier, having a relapse prevention plan and a support system in place.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Let's spend some time now creating that plan together. We can start by identifying some early warning signs of depression for you to watch out for, and then brainstorm some strategies for managing those symptoms if they come up. What are some signs that you might be starting to struggle again?\n\nPatient: Well, I know that when I start isolating myself and avoiding things I usually enjoy, that's a red flag. And if I'm having a lot of negative thoughts about myself and my future, that's another sign.\n\nTherapist: Those are great insights, Aaliyah. So if you notice yourself starting to isolate or having a lot of negative thoughts, what are some things you can do to take care of yourself?\n\nPatient: I can reach out to my support system, like my cousin or a friend from my support group. I can also do some thought records to challenge those negative thoughts, and make sure I'm staying active and engaged in my life, even if it's hard.\n\nTherapist: Those are fantastic strategies, Aaliyah. It's so important to catch those early signs and take action to support yourself. Remember, you don't have to wait until things get really bad to reach out for help or use your skills. The earlier you intervene, the easier it is to get back on track.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I don't have to suffer in silence or try to tough it out alone.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. You have a whole toolbox of skills and supports to draw on, and the more you practice using them, the more automatic it becomes. It's like building a muscle, remember?\n\nPatient: Yes, I remember. It's still hard sometimes, but it's getting easier with practice.\n\nTherapist: That's the key - practice. And speaking of practice, let's talk about some homework for this week. I'd like you to continue working on your thought records and Positive Data Log, and also start drafting your relapse prevention plan. Write down your early warning signs, coping strategies, and supports, and keep it somewhere accessible so you can refer to it if needed.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. I'll work on that this week.\n\nTherapist: Great. And remember, this is just a draft. We can keep refining and updating it as we go. The important thing is to have a starting point, a roadmap for how to take care of yourself going forward.\n\nPatient: I appreciate that. It's good to know that I don't have to have it all figured out right away.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. This is an ongoing process, and you'll keep learning and growing with every step. And I'm here to support you every step of the way, even after our sessions end.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. That means a lot to me.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Aaliyah. I am so proud of you and all the hard work you've done. You've come so far, and I know you'll keep moving forward. Remember, progress isn't always a straight line, but every step counts. Keep showing up for yourself, using your skills, and reaching out for support when you need it. You've got this.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Reviewed progress and skills learned in therapy, discussed feelings about ending therapy, created a relapse prevention plan, explored options for ongoing support after therapy ends.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Thought records (continuing from previous sessions), Positive Data Log (continuing from previous sessions), coping cards (introduced in this session), relapse prevention planning (introduced in this session), support planning (introduced in this session).\n- Homework assigned: Continue working on thought records and Positive Data Log, draft a relapse prevention plan including early warning signs, coping strategies, and supports.\n- Patient's progress and challenges: Aaliyah has made significant progress in recognizing and challenging negative thoughts, building a support system, and prioritizing her own well-being.
