  "transcript": "Therapist: I'm glad to hear you attempted the behavioral experiment with your group project. What prediction did you make beforehand about how it would go? \n\nPatient: I predicted that I wouldn't contribute much of value and that my group members would think I was holding them back. I thought they'd be frustrated with me.\n\nTherapist: And what actually happened during the group project? \n\nPatient: Well, I did share some ideas, even though I didn't talk as much as some of the others. No one seemed annoyed with me or anything. We divided up the work and everyone seemed okay with their part.\n\nTherapist: So it sounds like the outcome was different than what you predicted. Your group members didn't express frustration and the project got divided up without issue. What do you make of that?\n\nPatient: I guess it shows that my worst fears didn't come true. Even if I wasn't the most talkative, I still contributed. And my group members didn't seem to judge me for it.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. This experiment provided some evidence against your belief that you have no value to contribute and that others see you as a failure. With more experiments like this, we can start to chip away at that negative core belief. It takes time, but each piece of contradictory evidence helps.\n\nPatient: I can see that. It's just hard to let go of beliefs I've held for so long.\n\nTherapist: I understand. These beliefs are deeply ingrained and it takes repeated experiences to shift them. That's why we practice these techniques - to gradually build up that evidence and reinforce new, more balanced beliefs. You're doing great with this so far.\n\nPatient: Thanks, it helps to hear that. I know I need to keep practicing.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. The more you can engage in these experiments and gather evidence, the more it will help challenge that negative core belief. And remember, we're looking for progress, not perfection. Each small step counts.\n\nPatient: That's a good reminder. I can be hard on myself when I feel like I'm not improving fast enough.\n\nTherapist: That's very common. Many people with depression hold themselves to unrealistic standards. But in reality, change is often a gradual process. I encourage you to give yourself credit for the work you're doing, even if it feels small. Every time you complete a thought record or an experiment, that's a step forward.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just frustrating to still have these negative thoughts and feelings.\n\nTherapist: I hear you. Depression is a challenging illness and recovery is a process. But I want to assure you that the work you're doing is making a difference, even if it's not always easy to see. You're developing skills and insights that will help you manage your depression more effectively over time. Let's keep going.",
