  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying to remind myself that my worth isn't defined by my grades or how much I accomplish in a day. But it's hard to really believe that when I've been thinking this way for so long.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it can be difficult to change long-held beliefs. It takes practice and patience. Let's look at one of the thought records you completed over the week. Can you share an example of a situation where you had a negative thought related to your self-worth?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last Wednesday, I got a lower grade than I expected on a paper I worked really hard on. I started thinking, \"I'm not smart enough to be in this program\" and \"I'm going to disappoint everyone who believes in me.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Aaliyah. Those thoughts can be really painful. Let's walk through the process of challenging them together. What evidence do you have against the thought \"I'm not smart enough to be in this program\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I've made it this far in the program, and I've gotten good grades in other classes. And my professors have given me positive feedback before.\n\nTherapist: That's great evidence against the negative thought. What about the thought \"I'm going to disappoint everyone who believes in me\"? What evidence do you have against that?\n\nPatient: I know my family and friends are proud of me no matter what. They've told me that they just want me to be happy and healthy. And my academic advisor has been really supportive, even when I've struggled.\n\nTherapist: That's really important to remember. It sounds like you have people in your life who care about you unconditionally. Now, let's try to come up with an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence against these negative thoughts. What could that look like?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like \"One grade doesn't define my intelligence or worth. I've overcome challenges before, and I have people who support me no matter what.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Aaliyah. How does that feel compared to the original negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: It feels more balanced and compassionate. It reminds me that I don't have to be perfect to be worthy of love and support.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And with practice, it will become easier to challenge those negative thoughts and replace them with more adaptive ones. Remember, our thoughts are not always accurate reflections of reality. They're often influenced by our emotions and past experiences.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I just wish I could believe the alternative thoughts more easily.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable. It takes time and repetition to shift those deeply held beliefs. That's why we practice challenging them consistently. And even if you don't fully believe the alternative thoughts at first, you can still act in ways that align with them. Over time, your beliefs will start to shift.\n\nPatient: I've noticed that when I'm feeling really down, it's harder to challenge my thoughts. It's like I get stuck in a negative spiral.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. When we're feeling strong emotions, it can be more difficult to think objectively. That's why it's important to have a plan in place for those moments. One strategy we can use is called \"thought stopping.\" It involves recognizing when you're starting to spiral and using a specific phrase or action to interrupt the negative thought pattern.\n\nPatient: That sounds interesting. How does it work?\n\nTherapist: First, you need to identify a phrase or action that you can use to \"stop\" the negative thoughts. It could be something like saying \"stop\" out loud, visualizing a stop sign, or even snapping a rubber band on your wrist. The key is to have a consistent cue that you can use to interrupt the thought pattern.\n\nPatient: Okay, I think I could try visualizing a stop sign. Then what?\n\nTherapist: Once you've interrupted the negative thoughts, you can then use the thought challenging skills we've been practicing. You might not be able to do a full thought record in the moment, but you can remind yourself of the alternative thoughts you've come up with or focus on the evidence against the negative thoughts.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of having a specific plan for those moments when I feel stuck.\n\nTherapist: It can be really empowering to have tools like this to use when you're struggling. Another strategy we can use is called \"worry time.\" It involves setting aside a specific time each day to focus on your worries or negative thoughts.\n\nPatient: How does that help? Wouldn't it just make me feel worse to focus on my worries?\n\nTherapist: It might seem counterintuitive, but setting aside dedicated \"worry time\" can actually help reduce the amount of time you spend worrying overall. During the rest of the day, when worries or negative thoughts come up, you can remind yourself that you'll deal with them during your scheduled worry time.\n\nPatient: So it's like giving myself permission to worry, but only at certain times?\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And during your worry time, you can use the thought challenging skills we've been practicing. The goal is to contain the worries to a specific time, rather than letting them take over your whole day.\n\nPatient: I can see how that could be helpful. I'll give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Great. Remember, these are skills that take practice. Be patient with yourself as you're learning to use them. And we can always troubleshoot and adjust the strategies as needed.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate you giving me these tools to work with. It feels good to have a plan.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Aaliyah. I'm glad these strategies resonate with you. Remember, you've already made progress in recognizing and challenging your negative thoughts. These additional tools can help you build on that progress and manage the tough moments a bit more effectively.",
