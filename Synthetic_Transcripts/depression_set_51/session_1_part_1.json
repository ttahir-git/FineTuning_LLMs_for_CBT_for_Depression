  "transcript": "Patient: Hi Nova, I'm Aaliyah. It's nice to meet you. I'm a bit nervous about starting therapy, but I know I need help managing my depression.\n\nTherapist: Hello Aaliyah, it's great to meet you too. I understand that starting therapy can feel daunting, but I'm here to support you through this process. As your AI therapist, my role is to guide you through the assessment phase, where we'll work together to better understand your experiences and develop a plan for your treatment. \n\nBefore we begin, I want to acknowledge some limitations I have as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information or misunderstand something you say. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel that you're in crisis, it's essential to reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted person in your life. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like facial expressions or body language.\n\nWith that said, I'm here to listen, support, and work collaboratively with you to help you manage your depression. Can you tell me a bit about what led you to seek therapy at this time?\n\nPatient: Thank you for explaining that, Nova. It's reassuring to know what to expect. I decided to seek therapy because I've been struggling with depression for a while now, and it's been affecting my life in significant ways. I'm finding it hard to concentrate on my studies, and I often feel disconnected from my friends and family.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Aaliyah. It takes courage to acknowledge when we need help. Depression can have a profound impact on various aspects of our lives, including our relationships and daily functioning. I'd like to learn more about your current life situation and the specific challenges you're facing. This will help me better understand your needs and tailor our sessions accordingly.\n\nBefore we dive in, I'd like to propose an agenda for today's session. We can start by discussing your current life situation and the challenges you're experiencing. We'll also explore your goals for therapy and what you hope to achieve through our work together. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I'm ready to start discussing my current situation and challenges. As for my goals, I want to find ways to manage my depression and anxiety, improve my self-care, and build stronger connections with others.",
