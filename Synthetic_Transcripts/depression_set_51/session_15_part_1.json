  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Aaliyah, it's great to see you again for session 15. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to remind you that while I'm here to support you, I do have some limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to working with you and supporting your journey towards better mental health. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I tried the behavioral experiment with the yoga class, and it was an interesting experience. I also continued working on the thought records, but I did struggle with prioritizing self-care at times.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear you tried the yoga class and continued with the thought records. We can definitely explore your experience with the behavioral experiment and discuss any challenges you faced with self-care. Before we set our agenda for today, can you share a bit more about how you've been feeling emotionally and what's been on your mind lately?\n\nPatient: Emotionally, I've had some ups and downs. I noticed that I felt a bit lighter after the yoga class, but the effect didn't last very long. I've been worrying about my upcoming exams and whether I'll be able to perform well. It's been hard to shake off the feeling that I'm not doing enough, even though I know logically that I'm putting in a lot of effort.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to have those worries, especially when you're facing important exams. The fact that you're aware of the discrepancy between your logical understanding and your emotional response is a great insight. We can definitely work on bridging that gap. For today's agenda, I suggest we start by debriefing your experience with the yoga class and exploring the temporary impact it had on your mood. Then, we can review your thought records and discuss any challenges with prioritizing self-care. We'll also work on strengthening your alternative core belief and practice some cognitive restructuring techniques. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I'd like to start with discussing the yoga class experience and then move on to the thought records and self-care challenges. I think those are the areas where I need the most support right now.\n\nTherapist: Perfect, let's start with the yoga class experience. Can you walk me through what happened, from the moment you decided to go until after the class ended? I'm interested in hearing about your thoughts, emotions, and any physical sensations you noticed throughout the process.",
