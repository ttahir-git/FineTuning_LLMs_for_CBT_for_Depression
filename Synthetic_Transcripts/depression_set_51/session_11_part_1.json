  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Aaliyah, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'd like to start by checking in with you. How have you been since our last session? Can you share any experiences or changes you've noticed in your mood or thoughts?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the self-compassion break and continuum technique. It's been challenging at times, especially when I'm feeling really down on myself. I've noticed that I tend to fall back into old patterns of thinking, like all-or-nothing thinking and being overly self-critical.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been practicing the techniques, even though it's been challenging. Falling back into old patterns is a normal part of the process, and it's something we can continue to work on together. Can you share a specific situation where you found it difficult to apply the techniques?\n\nPatient: Yeah, just the other day, I was working on a group project for one of my classes. I felt like I wasn't contributing enough to the project, and I started thinking that I was letting my team down. I tried to use the continuum technique to challenge my all-or-nothing thinking, but it was hard to shake the feeling that I wasn't doing enough.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Aaliyah. Group projects can be stressful, and it's common to feel like you're not contributing enough. Let's explore this further. What evidence do you have that you weren't contributing enough to the project?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I didn't speak up as much as some of the other team members during our meetings. I also felt like my ideas weren't as good as theirs, so I didn't share them.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you're basing your contribution on the amount you spoke during meetings and the quality of your ideas. Let's look at this from a different perspective. Are there other ways you contributed to the project that don't involve speaking up in meetings or having the \"best\" ideas?\n\nPatient: I suppose I did do a lot of the research for the project, and I helped organize our notes and put together the presentation. I guess those are valuable contributions too.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Those are significant contributions to the project. It's important to recognize that everyone contributes in different ways, and all contributions are valuable. Let's try to apply the continuum technique here. On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being no contribution at all and 100 being a perfect contribution, where would you rate your contribution to the project?\n\nPatient: I'd probably rate myself around a 60 or 65.\n\nTherapist: That's a good starting point. Now, let's consider the evidence you mentioned earlier about your research, organization, and putting together the presentation. How does that evidence influence your rating?\n\nPatient: When I think about it that way, I guess I would rate myself higher, maybe around a 75 or 80.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Aaliyah! By considering the evidence and using the continuum technique, you were able to challenge your all-or-nothing thinking and develop a more balanced view of your contribution. This is an important skill to practice, and it will get easier over time.\n\nNow, let's set an agenda for today's session. We can continue working on challenging negative thoughts and building more adaptive beliefs. We can also discuss any other challenges or concerns you'd like to address. What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I'd like to focus on challenging my negative thoughts and building more adaptive beliefs. I also wanted to talk about how my cultural background and familial expectations contribute to my feelings of pressure and inadequacy.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. We'll start by exploring how your cultural background and familial expectations influence your thoughts and beliefs. Then, we'll work on challenging negative thoughts and building more adaptive beliefs. If time allows, we can also discuss additional coping strategies for managing feelings of pressure and inadequacy.\n\nDoes this agenda sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
