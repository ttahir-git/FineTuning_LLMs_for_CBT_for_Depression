  "transcript": "Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful and less anxious. It reminds me that one setback doesn't mean I'm a failure, and that there are still opportunities for me to succeed.\n\nTherapist: That's really important to recognize. Challenging those automatic thoughts and coming up with more balanced alternatives can have a big impact on how you feel and how you approach challenges. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the more automatic it will become.\n\nPatient: I definitely see how this could be helpful long-term. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. It can be challenging to remember to use these skills when you're feeling really emotional. One thing that can help is to practice them regularly, even when you're not feeling particularly upset. That way, they become more automatic and easier to access when you need them.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to make it a habit to do thought records more regularly, not just when I'm feeling really down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. Another thing that can be helpful is to identify some of the common triggers or situations where you tend to have negative thoughts, and plan ahead for how you might use these skills in those situations.\n\nPatient: I know one trigger for me is getting feedback on assignments. I always feel really anxious and start thinking negatively about myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. So one thing you could do is plan to do a thought record after you get feedback on an assignment, even if you don't feel particularly upset. That way, you're practicing the skill in a situation that's often challenging for you.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's kind of like preparing myself ahead of time.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's like building up a toolbox of skills that you can pull out when you need them. And the more you practice using them, the more natural it will feel.\n\nPatient: I'm definitely going to try that. I feel like I have a better sense of how to actually use these techniques in my daily life now.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay if it feels challenging at times. The important thing is that you keep practicing and being kind to yourself along the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you. I'm really grateful for your support and guidance through this process.\n\nTherapist: It's my pleasure. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, you're making progress, even if it doesn't always feel like it. Every small step counts.\n\nPatient: That's a good reminder. I guess I just have to keep taking it one day at a time.",
