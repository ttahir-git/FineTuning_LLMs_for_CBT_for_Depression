  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Aaliyah, it's great to see you again for session 16. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. If you ever feel you need immediate support, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I can't observe or interpret your non-verbal cues, so I'll rely on you to share your thoughts and feelings openly. With that said, how have you been since our last session? How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to keep up with the thought records and self-care, but it's been challenging with my class workload and job. I did the behavioral experiment and shared something personal with my roommate, and it went better than I expected. She was really supportive and understanding. But I still find myself struggling with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the behavioral experiment went well and that your roommate was supportive. It takes courage to open up and share something personal. Regarding your struggles with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, let's explore that further today. How about we start by reviewing your thought records and discussing any challenges that came up with self-care? We can also continue working on challenging your negative core beliefs and strengthening more adaptive ones. Does that sound okay to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today's session?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'd also like to talk about how I can manage my negative thoughts when I'm feeling overwhelmed with school and work. It's been really hard to focus on anything else when I'm stressed about deadlines and assignments.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss strategies for managing negative thoughts during stressful times. It's common for negative thoughts to become louder and more persistent when we're feeling overwhelmed. One technique that can be helpful is mindfulness \u2013 taking a few moments to step back from your thoughts and observe them without judgment. We can also explore ways to break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps and prioritize self-care during busy periods. Let's keep that in mind as we review your thought records and discuss your experiences with self-care over the past week.",
