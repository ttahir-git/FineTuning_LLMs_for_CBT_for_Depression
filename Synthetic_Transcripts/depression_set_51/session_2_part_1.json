  "transcript": "Therapist: Welcome back, Aaliyah! I'm glad to hear that you're feeling good about our session today. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge some limitations of our interaction. As an AI, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being transparent about your limitations. I'm here to focus on managing my depression, so let's continue with that.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your homework from the previous session. Were you able to keep a thought record over the past week? If so, can you share some of the thoughts and feelings you noted?\n\nPatient: Yes, I did keep a thought record. It was challenging at first, but I tried to be as honest as possible. I noticed that I often have thoughts like \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I'll never be able to cope with this.\" These thoughts usually lead to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and sometimes even anger.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing, Aaliyah. Keeping a thought record is an essential step in CBT, as it helps us identify patterns in your thinking. Today, I'd like to focus on exploring these negative thought patterns further and understanding how they contribute to your depression. We'll also discuss strategies to challenge and reframe these thoughts. How does that sound for our agenda today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm ready to dive deeper into these thoughts and learn how to manage them better.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. Let's start by discussing the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in the CBT framework. Our thoughts influence our emotions, which in turn affect our actions. For example, if you think \"I'm not good enough,\" you might feel sad or hopeless, leading you to withdraw from activities or social interactions. Does this resonate with your experience?",
