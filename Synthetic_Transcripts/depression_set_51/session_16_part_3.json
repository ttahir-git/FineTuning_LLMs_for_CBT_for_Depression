  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you walking me through that thought record. It does help to look at the evidence more objectively. I guess I just struggle to do that in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Aaliyah. It takes practice to be able to catch those negative thoughts and challenge them in real-time. One strategy that can help is to schedule regular \"check-ins\" with yourself throughout the day, where you take a few minutes to reflect on your thoughts and emotions. This can help you identify negative thought patterns earlier, before they become too intense.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I could try setting reminders on my phone to do that. I think I also need to work on being kinder to myself when I'm struggling. I'm so quick to criticize myself and assume the worst.\n\nTherapist: Developing self-compassion is a crucial part of challenging negative core beliefs. When you notice yourself being self-critical, try to imagine what you would say to a close friend or loved one in a similar situation. Would you be as harsh with them as you are with yourself?\n\nPatient: No, I wouldn't. I'm much more understanding and supportive with my friends and family. It's just harder to extend that same compassion to myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Aaliyah. Recognizing that double standard is an important first step. As we continue working on reframing your core beliefs, we'll focus on developing a more compassionate and balanced view of yourself. This means acknowledging your strengths and accomplishments, as well as your challenges and areas for growth, without judgment.\n\nPatient: I like the sound of that. It's just hard to break out of the habit of being so self-critical. It feels like it's become such a big part of how I think about myself.\n\nTherapist: Changing long-standing thought patterns does take time and practice. Remember that every time you catch a negative thought and challenge it, you're taking a step towards building new, more adaptive thought patterns. It's a process of gradually rewiring your brain, and it's okay if it feels difficult at times. The important thing is to keep practicing and not give up on yourself.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the encouragement. I'll keep trying to catch those negative thoughts and reframe them. I know it won't be easy, but I'm committed to working on it.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Aaliyah. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. In addition to our sessions, don't hesitate to reach out to your support system when you need encouragement or a different perspective. Talking through your thoughts with someone you trust can be a helpful way to gain new insights and challenge negative beliefs.",
