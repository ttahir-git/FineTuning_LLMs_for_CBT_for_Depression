  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can share an example from my thought record. Last week, I was working on a group project for one of my classes, and I felt like I wasn't contributing enough to the discussion. I started thinking that I was letting my team down and that they probably thought I was useless.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Aaliyah. I can see how that situation triggered negative thoughts about yourself. Let's walk through the thought record together. What emotions did you experience during that situation, and how intense were they?\n\nPatient: I felt really anxious and sad. I'd say the anxiety was around an 8 out of 10, and the sadness was about a 7.\n\nTherapist: That must have been really difficult for you. What evidence did you find that supported or challenged the thought that you were letting your team down and that they thought you were useless?\n\nPatient: Well, I realized that I had actually contributed some ideas earlier in the discussion, even if they weren't the most groundbreaking. And no one on my team said anything negative about my contributions or gave me any indication that they thought I was useless.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you were able to identify evidence that challenges those negative thoughts. What alternative thought did you come up with?\n\nPatient: I tried to reframe it as \"I may not have contributed as much as I would have liked, but I still added value to the discussion. My team's opinion of me doesn't define my worth.\"\n\nTherapist: I think that's a really powerful reframe, Aaliyah. How did your emotions change after coming up with that alternative thought?\n\nPatient: My anxiety and sadness both went down a bit, maybe to a 5 out of 10.\n\nTherapist: That's progress! It shows that challenging those negative thoughts can help reduce the intensity of the emotions they trigger. Let's keep practicing this skill.\n\nPatient: I'm definitely seeing the value in it, even though it's hard to do in the moment.\n\nTherapist: It's totally normal for it to feel challenging at first. With practice, it will start to feel more natural. I'm curious, do you notice any patterns or themes in the negative thoughts you've been having?\n\nPatient: I think a lot of them tie back to that core belief we've talked about - that I'm a failure and will never be successful. I often feel like I'm not good enough or that I don't belong, especially in social situations.\n\nTherapist: You're making a really important connection there, Aaliyah. Our core beliefs can influence the automatic thoughts we have in specific situations. Let's explore that core belief a bit more. What experiences or messages do you think contributed to that belief?\n\nPatient: I think a lot of it comes from my family and cultural background. My parents always had really high expectations for me, and I felt like I had to be perfect to make them proud. And being a first-generation college student, I sometimes feel like an outsider in academia.\n\nTherapist: That makes a lot of sense, Aaliyah. Our early experiences and cultural context can have a big impact on the beliefs we develop about ourselves. But the good news is that we can work to change those beliefs, even if they've been with us for a long time.\n\nPatient: I'm starting to see that, but it's still hard to fully believe the alternative thoughts sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's totally understandable. Changing core beliefs is a process, and it takes time and practice. One strategy we can use is the positive data log we talked about last session. How has that been going for you?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to write down evidence that supports the new belief \"I am capable and valuable,\" but it's been challenging to come up with examples sometimes.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're giving it a try, even though it's challenging. Let's brainstorm some examples together. What's something you've done recently that demonstrates your capability and value?\n\nPatient: Well, I did get an A on a paper I wrote for one of my classes last week. And I volunteered at the animal shelter over the weekend, which felt meaningful.\n\nTherapist: Those are both great examples! Getting an A on a paper shows your intelligence and hard work, and volunteering at the animal shelter shows your compassion and dedication to helping others. Let's write those down in your positive data log.\n\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense. I guess I just have a hard time seeing those things as evidence of my worth sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a really common challenge, Aaliyah. It's easy to discount the positives and focus on the negatives. That's why it's so important to intentionally look for and record evidence that supports your new, more adaptive beliefs.\n\nPatient: I can see how that could be helpful over time.\n\nTherapist: Definitely. And as you continue to gather evidence, it will start to feel more natural to challenge those negative core beliefs. Another strategy we can use is behavioral experiments. We talked about designing an experiment related to your beliefs about your value in group projects. How did that go?",
