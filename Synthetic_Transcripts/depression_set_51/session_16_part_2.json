  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying to keep up with the thought records, but it's been hard to find the time with all my assignments and work. I feel like I'm constantly falling behind, and that just makes me feel worse about myself.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that finding time for thought records can be challenging, especially when you're juggling multiple responsibilities. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and emotions that come up when you feel like you're falling behind?\n\nPatient: Well, I start thinking that I'm not good enough, and that everyone else is doing better than me. I feel like I'm letting everyone down - my parents, my professors, even myself. It's just this constant pressure to be perfect, and when I can't meet those expectations, I feel like a failure.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Aaliyah. It sounds like these thoughts are closely tied to your core belief of being unworthy and unlovable. Let's take a closer look at one of these situations using a thought record. Can you think of a specific instance this past week when you felt like you were falling behind and not meeting expectations?\n\nPatient: Yeah, last Tuesday I had a big paper due, and I just couldn't focus on it. I kept getting distracted by my phone and social media, and before I knew it, half the day was gone. I started panicking, thinking there was no way I could get it done in time.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's use that situation to fill out a thought record together. What emotions were you feeling in that moment, and how intense were they on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I was feeling really anxious, probably around 85. And I was also feeling guilty and ashamed, maybe around 75.\n\nTherapist: And what was the most prominent automatic thought that came to your mind in that situation?\n\nPatient: I think it was something like, \"I'm such a failure. I can't even focus on a simple paper. I'm letting everyone down.\"\n\nTherapist: Now, let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're a failure and letting everyone down?\n\nPatient: Well, I was procrastinating on the paper, and I've been struggling to keep up with my classes in general. I feel like I'm not living up to my potential or meeting the expectations of the people around me.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against that thought? What are some reasons why it might not be entirely true?\n\nPatient: I guess I have been managing to keep my grades up, even if it feels like a struggle. And my professors and advisor have been supportive and understanding when I've talked to them about my challenges. My parents are always telling me how proud they are, even when I feel like I'm not doing enough.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Aaliyah. It's important to recognize the evidence that contradicts your negative thoughts. Now, based on the evidence for and against, what would be a more balanced and realistic way to reframe that initial thought?\n\nPatient: I could say something like, \"I'm struggling with this paper, but that doesn't mean I'm a failure. I've been able to succeed in my classes before, and I have support from the people around me. One difficult assignment doesn't define my worth or abilities.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought. How do you feel now, after going through this process?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit better, actually. My anxiety and guilt are probably more around 50 now instead of 85 and 75.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful progress, Aaliyah. This is a great example of how thought records can help us challenge negative thoughts and reframe them in a more balanced way. As we continue practicing this skill, it will become easier to catch those negative thoughts in the moment and counter them with more realistic and compassionate ones.",
