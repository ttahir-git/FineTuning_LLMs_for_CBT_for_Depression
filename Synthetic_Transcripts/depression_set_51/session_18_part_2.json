  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you being willing to focus on what's most important to me right now.\n\nTherapist: Of course, Aaliyah. This is your therapy journey, and I'm here to support you in the areas that feel most relevant and impactful for you. Let's start by exploring those feelings of guilt and disconnection. Can you tell me more about what's been coming up for you in that area?\n\nPatient: Well, I feel like I'm not living up to the expectations of my family and community back home. They're all so proud of me for getting into this prestigious university, but I feel like I'm struggling just to keep my head above water. I miss the close-knit support system I had back home, and I feel guilty for not being there for them like I used to be.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility and expectation, both from others and from yourself. That can be a lot to handle, especially when you're also dealing with depression. Let's try to break this down a bit. What do you think is at the root of these feelings of guilt?\n\nPatient: I think it's partly because I've always been the \"strong one\" in my family. I was the first to go to college, and everyone looks up to me. But now, I feel like I'm barely holding it together. I'm afraid of letting them down.\n\nTherapist: That fear of letting others down can be a powerful force, and it's closely tied to some of those negative core beliefs we've been working on, like \"I'm unworthy\" or \"I'm not good enough.\" But I want to remind you that your worth is not defined by your achievements or others' expectations. You are inherently worthy, regardless of your struggles or setbacks.\n\nPatient: I know that intellectually, but it's hard to really believe it sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's why we've been working on challenging those negative beliefs and building up evidence to support more adaptive ones. And part of that process is learning to prioritize your own well-being, even when it feels like it conflicts with what others might want or expect from you. Have you been able to practice setting boundaries or asserting your needs with your family or community?\n\nPatient: Not really. I feel like I'm always putting on a brave face and trying to be strong for everyone else. I don't want to burden them with my problems.\n\nTherapist: I understand that desire to protect your loved ones, but it's also important to remember that you deserve support and understanding too. Have you considered talking to someone in your family or community about what you've been going through?\n\nPatient: I've thought about it, but I'm afraid they won't understand. Mental health isn't something we really talk about in my community.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, and it can be scary to open up about something so personal, especially when you're not sure how it will be received. But I wonder if there might be someone in your life who could surprise you with their empathy and support. Even just sharing a small piece of your experience could be a way to start building that connection and reducing those feelings of disconnection and guilt.\n\nPatient: Maybe. I have a cousin who's always been pretty understanding. Maybe I could start by talking to her.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great first step. And remember, you don't have to share everything all at once. You can start small and see how it feels. The important thing is that you're taking steps to reach out and build that support system, both for your own well-being and to challenge those negative beliefs about being a burden or letting others down.\n\nPatient: I'll try. It's just hard to break those old patterns of thinking and behaving.\n\nTherapist: It is hard, and it takes practice and patience. But every time you challenge those negative beliefs and take a step towards prioritizing your own well-being, you're making progress. And that progress adds up over time, even if it doesn't always feel like it in the moment.\n\nPatient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your encouragement and support.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Aaliyah. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, this is a journey, and there will be ups and downs. But you have the tools and the strength to keep moving forward. Let's keep working together to build those skills and strategies for managing your depression and building a life that feels meaningful and fulfilling to you.",
