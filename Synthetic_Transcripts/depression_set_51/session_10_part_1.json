  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Aaliyah, it's great to see you again for our tenth session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been trying to work on the homework you assigned, but it's been challenging. I've been feeling more down than usual, and I'm struggling to find the motivation to complete the thought records and positive data log consistently.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Aaliyah. It's common to experience ups and downs throughout the therapy process. Can you tell me more about what's been contributing to your low mood lately?\n\nPatient: I think it's a combination of things. I've been feeling overwhelmed with schoolwork and my part-time job at the animal shelter. I'm also still struggling with feelings of worthlessness and the belief that I'm not good enough, especially when it comes to my academic performance and my ability to contribute to my community.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot lately. I want to acknowledge the progress you've made so far, even if it feels small at times. Let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on? We could explore the challenges you've been facing with the homework, discuss your feelings of worthlessness, or address any other concerns you have.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on the challenges with the homework and how it relates to my feelings of worthlessness. I'm also interested in learning more coping strategies for when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a good plan. We can start by discussing the challenges you've faced with the homework and explore how they relate to your feelings of worthlessness. Then, we can work on developing some additional coping strategies to help you manage overwhelming situations. How does that sound?",
