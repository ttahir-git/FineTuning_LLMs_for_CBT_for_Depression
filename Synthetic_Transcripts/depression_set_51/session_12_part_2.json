  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your thought records from the past week. Were you able to complete them, and if so, what insights did you gain from the process?\n\nPatient: I did complete some thought records, but I found it challenging to do them consistently. When I did manage to fill them out, I noticed that a lot of my negative thoughts were related to feeling inadequate and like I don't belong here at college.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you were able to identify some common themes in your negative thoughts. Consistency can be challenging, but the more you practice, the easier it becomes. Let's take a closer look at one of the thought records you completed. Can you walk me through the situation and the thoughts you recorded?\n\nPatient: Sure. One situation that stood out was during a group project meeting. I didn't contribute much to the discussion, and I left feeling like I wasn't pulling my weight in the group. My automatic thought was, \"I'm not smart enough to be here, and my group members probably think I'm useless.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. I can see how that thought would be distressing. Let's explore this further using the downward arrow technique. If it were true that you weren't smart enough and your group members thought you were useless, what would that mean to you?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I don't deserve to be here, and that I'm letting everyone down \u2013 my family, my professors, and myself.\n\nTherapist: And if that were true, that you don't deserve to be here and you're letting everyone down, what would that mean about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm a failure and a disappointment.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your willingness to explore these deeper beliefs. It seems that this situation triggered thoughts related to a core belief of being a failure or a disappointment. These core beliefs can be quite powerful and influence how we interpret situations. Let's work on reframing this thought using some cognitive restructuring techniques.",
