  "transcript": "Therapist: Aaliyah, thank you for sharing your goals for therapy. They provide a clear direction for our work together. To help me understand your experience better, could you tell me more about how your depression has been affecting your daily life and relationships?\n\nPatient: Well, I often struggle to get out of bed in the morning, even though I know I have classes or work commitments. I feel exhausted all the time, and it's hard to concentrate on my assignments. I've also been avoiding social situations, like hanging out with my roommates or attending church events, because I don't have the energy or desire to engage with others.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like your depression is significantly impacting your motivation, energy levels, and ability to connect with others. I appreciate you being open about these challenges. You mentioned that you're a senior in college, majoring in social work. How has your depression affected your academic performance and your ability to pursue your passion for helping others?\n\nPatient: My grades have been slipping because I'm struggling to keep up with the coursework. I love my major, but I feel like I'm not doing as well as I should be. It's frustrating because I know I'm capable of more, but my depression makes everything feel so much harder. I still volunteer at the animal shelter, but even that feels like a struggle sometimes.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel frustrated when depression interferes with your goals and passions. It's clear that you have a strong sense of purpose and a desire to make a positive impact, but your depression is making it challenging to fully engage in these areas of your life. Let's explore your personal history a bit more. You mentioned growing up in a close-knit, religious family. How has your relationship with your family and your faith been affected by your depression?\n\nPatient: My family is very important to me, and I know they love and support me, but I feel like I can't be completely open with them about my struggles. They have high expectations for me, and I don't want to disappoint them. As for my faith, I still pray and try to stay connected to my beliefs, but sometimes it's hard to find comfort in religion when I'm feeling so low.\n\nTherapist: It's common for individuals to feel a sense of disconnection from their support systems and beliefs when experiencing depression. It can be challenging to reconcile the expectations of others with your own emotional needs. We can explore this further in our sessions and work on finding ways to communicate your needs effectively while maintaining your relationships and values.\n\nI'm noticing a pattern in what you've shared so far. It seems that your depression is characterized by feelings of exhaustion, difficulty concentrating, and a tendency to withdraw from activities and relationships that once brought you joy or fulfillment. Does this resonate with your experience?",
