  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that stands out is when I got a lower grade than I expected on a paper. I immediately started thinking that I'm not cut out for this major and that I'll never be successful in my career.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to work with. Let's break this down using a thought record. Can you walk me through the situation, your emotions, and the automatic thoughts that came up?\n\nPatient: Sure. The situation was getting a B- on a paper that I thought I did well on. I felt really disappointed, frustrated, and anxious. My automatic thoughts were things like \"I'm not smart enough for this major\" and \"I'll never be able to have the career I want.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, so we have the situation, your emotions, and the automatic thoughts. Now let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the thought \"I'm not smart enough for this major\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the evidence would be the lower grade on this paper, and the fact that I've been struggling to keep up with the workload lately.\n\nTherapist: And what about evidence against that thought?\n\nPatient: I mean, I have gotten good grades in other classes in my major. And I've been able to understand the material when I put in the effort. I also know that one paper doesn't define my entire academic ability.\n\nTherapist: That's really good evidence against the thought. It shows that you have had successes in your major and that this one grade doesn't necessarily reflect your overall abilities. Now let's look at the other automatic thought, \"I'll never be able to have the career I want.\" What evidence do you have for and against that thought?\n\nPatient: The evidence for it would be similar to the other thought, like struggling in this class and feeling unsure about my abilities. But the evidence against it is that I have had internships and volunteer experiences in my field that went well. And I know that there are many paths to a career, even if I don't get perfect grades.\n\nTherapist: You're doing a great job of examining the evidence for and against your automatic thoughts. It's clear that there is evidence on both sides, but the evidence against the thoughts suggests that they may not be entirely accurate or helpful. Now let's try to come up with some alternative thoughts based on the evidence we've looked at.\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be \"One grade doesn't define my entire academic ability, and I have had successes in my major before.\" Another could be \"There are many paths to a career, and I have valuable experiences that will help me even if I don't get perfect grades.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent alternative thoughts. They take into account the full range of evidence and provide a more balanced and realistic perspective. How do you feel when you consider these alternative thoughts compared to the original automatic thoughts?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit more hopeful and less anxious. It reminds me that one setback doesn't mean I'm a failure, and that there are still opportunities for me to succeed.\n\nTherapist: That's really important to recognize. Challenging those automatic thoughts and coming up with more balanced alternatives can have a big impact on how you feel and how you approach challenges. This is a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the more automatic it will become.",
