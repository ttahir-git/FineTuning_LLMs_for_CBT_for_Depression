  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's think about how to set up this experiment in a way that feels manageable for you. What specific yoga class were you considering?\n\nPatient: There's a gentle yoga class at the student wellness center on Thursday evenings. I've been wanting to try it, but I always feel like I should be studying instead.\n\nTherapist: That's a great option, Aaliyah. Attending a class at the wellness center can provide a supportive environment for your first experiment. To make it feel more manageable, could you plan to attend just one class this week and see how it goes?\n\nPatient: I think I could do that. Just one class doesn't feel as overwhelming as trying to commit to going every week.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Aaliyah. Starting with one class is a manageable first step. Before attending the class, I encourage you to write down your predictions about how you'll feel during and after the class. Then, after the class, you can write down your actual experience and compare it to your predictions. This will help you gather evidence about the actual impact of self-care on your well-being. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: It sounds like a good plan. I'm still a bit nervous, but I'm willing to try it.\n\nTherapist: I'm really proud of you for being willing to challenge these beliefs and try something new, Aaliyah. Remember, the goal is not to get rid of the guilty feelings entirely, but to start gathering evidence that self-care is actually beneficial, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. I'm confident that with practice, you'll start to see the positive impact of prioritizing your well-being.\n\nPatient: Thank you for your support and encouragement. I know this won't be easy, but I'm committed to working on it.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Aaliyah. I'm here to support you every step of the way. As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling. What's your mood like now, and do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit anxious about trying the yoga class, but I'm also feeling more hopeful. I know that challenging these beliefs is important for my mental health and well-being.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel anxious about trying something new, especially when it challenges long-held beliefs. I'm glad to hear that you're also feeling hopeful. That hope is a sign of your resilience and your commitment to your mental health. For homework this week, I'd like you to continue working on your thought records, focusing on gathering evidence against your negative core belief and in support of your new, more adaptive belief. I also encourage you to set up and complete the behavioral experiment with the yoga class, writing down your predictions and observations. Finally, continue working on incorporating small self-care activities into your daily routine, noticing the impact on your mood and well-being. Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?\n\nPatient: No, I think I understand the homework. I'll do my best to complete it.\n\nTherapist: Great, Aaliyah. Remember, the homework is not about being perfect, but about practicing these skills and gathering evidence to support your new, more compassionate beliefs. I'm confident that with practice, you'll start to see positive changes in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Aaliyah. I'm here to support you on your journey towards better mental health and well-being. Take care, and I'll see you next week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Continued working on thought records, focusing on gathering evidence against negative core belief and in support of new, more adaptive belief\n- Discussed the connection between core beliefs and difficulty prioritizing self-care\n- Introduced behavioral experiments as a way to test out beliefs and gather evidence\n- Set up a behavioral experiment for the patient to attend a yoga class and observe the impact on their well-being\n- Checked in on the patient's current mood and any final thoughts\n- Collaboratively discussed and assigned homework\n\nTechniques used:\n- Thought records\n- Cognitive restructuring\n- Downward arrow technique\n- Identifying intermediate and core beliefs\n- Behavioral experiments\n- Homework assignment\n\nHomework assigned:\n- Continue working on thought records, focusing on gathering evidence against negative core belief and in support of new, more adaptive belief\n- Set up and complete the behavioral experiment with the yoga class, writing down predictions and observations\n- Continue working on incorporating small self-care activities into daily routine, noticing the impact on mood and well-being\n\nPatient's progress and challenges:\n- Making progress with identifying negative thoughts and practicing cognitive restructuring\n- Challenging to prioritize self-care without feeling guilty\n- Feeling more hopeful after discussing cognitive restructuring techniques and self-care strategies\n- Nervous but willing to try the behavioral experiment with the yoga class\n\nCore beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n- Core belief: \"I'm unworthy and unlovable\"\n- Alternative core belief: \"I am worthy and lovable, even when I struggle or make mistakes.
