  "transcript": "Patient: When I really think about it, I guess there are other things that make me worthy. I'm a caring friend, I work hard in my volunteer position at the animal shelter, and I try to be a good daughter and sibling, even if I'm not always perfect.\n\nTherapist: Those are all wonderful qualities that contribute to your worth as a person. It's important to recognize that your value doesn't solely depend on your academic achievements or the approval of others. Let's try to expand on this idea. What are some small ways you could start to prioritize self-care and show yourself that you are worthy of care and compassion, regardless of your accomplishments?\n\nPatient: I could start by setting aside a specific time each day for self-care activities, like reading a book for pleasure or taking a relaxing bath. I could also try to be more mindful of my negative self-talk and challenge those thoughts when they arise.\n\nTherapist: Those are great ideas! Setting aside dedicated time for self-care can help you build a more balanced routine and show yourself that you are a priority. Challenging negative self-talk is also a powerful way to reinforce your new, more adaptive core belief. Let's practice that together now. Can you think of a recent situation where you engaged in negative self-talk?\n\nPatient: Yes, just the other day I was working on a group project, and I didn't contribute as much as I usually do because I wasn't feeling well. I kept telling myself that I was letting the team down and that they must think I'm lazy and unreliable.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example to work with. Let's use the thought record to challenge those negative thoughts. First, what emotions were you feeling in that moment?\n\nPatient: I was feeling guilty, anxious, and a bit ashamed.\n\nTherapist: And how intense were those emotions on a scale of 0 to 100?\n\nPatient: The guilt and anxiety were both around 80, and the shame was about 70.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write that down. Now, what was the most prominent automatic thought you had in that situation?\n\nPatient: The thought that stood out the most was, \"My team thinks I'm lazy and unreliable.\"\n\nTherapist: Let's explore that thought further. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess the evidence would be that I didn't contribute as much as I usually do, and I could tell that some of my team members were frustrated.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I did explain to my team that I wasn't feeling well, and they seemed to understand. I also know that I've been a reliable and hardworking team member in the past, so one off day doesn't necessarily mean they think I'm lazy.\n\nTherapist: That's an important perspective to consider. Now, let's look for any cognitive distortions in this thought. Do you notice any mind-reading or jumping to conclusions?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think I was definitely mind-reading. I assumed I knew what my team was thinking without any real evidence.\n\nTherapist: Great catch. Mind-reading can lead us to make inaccurate assumptions about others' thoughts and feelings. Now, let's try to reframe this thought in a more balanced and helpful way. What's an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence for and against the original thought?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"My team understands that I'm not feeling well today, and one off day doesn't define my overall work ethic or reliability.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and compassionate thought. How do you think this alternative thought would impact your emotions if you focused on it instead of the original thought?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel less guilty and anxious. Maybe the intensity of those emotions would go down to around 40 or 50.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift. This is another great example of how reframing our thoughts can directly impact our emotions. Let's add this alternative thought to your positive data log as well, as evidence against your core belief of being unworthy and unlovable.",
