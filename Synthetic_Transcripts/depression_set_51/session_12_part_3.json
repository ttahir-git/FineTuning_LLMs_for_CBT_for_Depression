  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's take a closer look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm not smart enough to be here, and my group members probably think I'm useless.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I didn't contribute much during the group meeting, and I felt like everyone else had better ideas than me. I also struggle with the coursework sometimes, and it takes me longer to understand the material compared to my classmates.\n\nTherapist: It's good that you're able to identify the evidence that seems to support the negative thought. Now, let's look for evidence against this thought. What are some reasons why this thought might not be entirely accurate?\n\nPatient: I guess I have been able to keep up with the coursework so far, even if it takes me longer. And I did get into this college, so they must have seen something in me. Also, my group members haven't said anything negative to me directly.\n\nTherapist: Those are great points, Aaliyah. It's important to consider the evidence from both sides. Another thing to keep in mind is that feelings are not always an accurate reflection of reality. Just because you feel like you're not smart enough doesn't necessarily mean it's true. Let's try to come up with an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence against the negative thought.\n\nPatient: I suppose an alternative thought could be, \"I may struggle at times, but I am capable of learning and contributing to my group. My group members probably understand that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought! It acknowledges the challenges you face while also recognizing your abilities and the understanding of your group members. How does this alternative thought make you feel compared to the original negative thought?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel a bit more hopeful and less anxious. I still have some doubts, but it helps to look at the situation from a different perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Aaliyah. Challenging negative thoughts and coming up with alternative thoughts is a skill that takes practice. The more you do it, the easier it will become. I'd like you to continue working on thought records this week, focusing on identifying evidence against your negative thoughts and generating alternative thoughts. We can review them together in our next session.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'll do my best to keep practicing. It's not easy, but I see how it can be helpful.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're finding it helpful. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay if you don't always get it right. The important thing is that you keep trying. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about balancing your academic responsibilities with taking care of your mental health. What are some of the challenges you've been facing in this area?\n\nPatient: One of the biggest challenges is finding time for self-care. I feel like I'm always behind on my coursework, and when I do have free time, I feel guilty for not using it to study or work on assignments. It's hard to prioritize my mental health when there's so much pressure to perform academically.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge for many students, especially those who struggle with depression. It's important to remember that taking care of your mental health is just as important as your academic responsibilities. In fact, neglecting your mental health can actually make it harder to perform well academically in the long run. Let's brainstorm some ways you can incorporate self-care into your routine without feeling guilty.",
