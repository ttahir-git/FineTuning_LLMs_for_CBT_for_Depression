  "transcript": "Patient: I feel like I've made a lot of progress, but I'm worried about maintaining it after our sessions end. What if I start to slip back into old patterns?\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to have concerns about maintaining your progress after therapy ends. That's why we're going to focus on relapse prevention planning today. One important aspect is identifying early warning signs that you might be starting to slip back into old patterns. What do you think some of those signs might be for you, Alexis?\n\nPatient: I think if I start isolating myself more, neglecting self-care, or getting stuck in negative thought patterns, those could be warning signs. Also, if I stop doing the things that I know help me, like volunteering or photography.\n\nTherapist: Those are great insights, Alexis. Recognizing those early warning signs is the first step in being able to intervene and get back on track. Let's talk about some specific strategies you can use when you notice those signs. One powerful tool is the \"Wellness Action Plan\" we've discussed before. This is a personalized plan that outlines steps you can take to maintain your well-being and cope with challenges. What are some things you might include in your Wellness Action Plan?\n\nPatient: I could include self-care activities that I know help me feel better, like taking a bath or going for a walk. I could also schedule regular check-ins with my support system, like my siblings or friends from the support group. And I could make a commitment to challenge negative thoughts using the skills I've learned in therapy.\n\nTherapist: Excellent ideas, Alexis. I particularly like the idea of scheduling regular check-ins with your support system. Social support is such a protective factor in maintaining mental health. Another helpful strategy can be to create coping cards with reminders of adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs. These can be like little \"pocket therapists\" that you can carry with you and pull out when you need a boost. What kind of reminders might be helpful for you to include on your coping cards?\n\nPatient: I could include reminders like \"I am worthy of self-care\" or \"Thoughts are not facts.\" I could also include some of the affirmations we've come up with in therapy, like \"I am resilient and capable of growth.\"\n\nTherapist: I love those ideas, Alexis. Those coping cards can be a powerful way to counteract negative self-talk and remind yourself of your strengths and capabilities. Another important aspect of relapse prevention is planning for how you'll handle potential setbacks or challenges. Let's brainstorm some strategies you could use if you find yourself struggling after therapy ends.",
