  "transcript": "Patient: One example of when I practiced cognitive restructuring was when I was looking at some of my recent photographs. I noticed myself starting to think, \"These aren't very good. I'm not as talented as I used to be.\" I caught myself and tried to reframe the thought by telling myself, \"I'm still learning and growing as a photographer. Not every photo will be perfect, and that's okay.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of catching a negative thought and reframing it in a more balanced and compassionate way. How did you feel after reframing the thought?\n\nPatient: I felt a bit better, more hopeful. It reminded me that I don't have to be perfect and that it's okay to have room for improvement. But I also noticed that the reframed thought didn't feel as \"true\" as the negative one, if that makes sense.\n\nTherapist: That makes a lot of sense, Alexis. When we've been thinking in a certain way for a long time, it can feel more \"true\" or automatic, even if it's not helpful or accurate. It takes time and practice to start believing the reframed thoughts. One way to strengthen the reframed thoughts is to look for evidence that supports them. In this case, can you think of any evidence that supports the idea that you're still learning and growing as a photographer?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose the fact that I'm still taking photos and trying new techniques is evidence that I'm learning. And I have gotten some positive feedback from friends and family on my recent work, even if I don't always see it myself.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of evidence that support the reframed thought. It's important to give those pieces of evidence as much weight as the evidence that seems to support the negative thoughts. Another thing to keep in mind is that thoughts are not facts. Just because we think something doesn't mean it's true. It can be helpful to remind yourself of that when you notice negative thoughts popping up.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I'll try to remember that thoughts are not facts. It's just hard sometimes when the thoughts feel so strong and convincing.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it can be really challenging to separate thoughts from facts, especially when the thoughts are intense. That's why we practice these techniques, to gradually build up that ability to step back and question our thoughts. And it's okay if it's difficult at first \u2013 that's why we keep practicing.\n\nPatient: I'm glad to hear that it's normal to find it difficult. I often feel like I should be able to do these things easily, and I get frustrated with myself when I can't.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, and it ties into what we've been discussing about self-compassion. Noticing that frustration with yourself is the first step in being able to practice self-compassion. When you notice that frustration, can you try to speak to yourself kindly, the way you might speak to a good friend who was struggling with something?\n\nPatient: I can try. It's just so automatic to be critical of myself. But I know that being kinder to myself is important.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you're willing to try. And you're right, being critical of ourselves is often an automatic habit. That's why we practice self-compassion, to gradually shift that habit. Remember, it's not about being perfect at it \u2013 it's about making small changes over time.\n\nPatient: Small changes over time \u2013 I like that. It feels less overwhelming than trying to change everything at once.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Small changes can add up to big differences over time. And every time you practice self-compassion, even if it's just a little bit, you're making a small change in the right direction.\n\nPatient: That's encouraging. I'll keep that in mind as I continue practicing.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that feels encouraging. And remember, you don't have to do this alone. You can always reach out for support, whether that's to me, to friends or family, or to other resources like support groups.\n\nPatient: That's a good reminder. I have been meaning to reach out to some friends, but I've been hesitant. I don't want to burden them with my struggles.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to worry about burdening others, but I wonder if that's another opportunity to practice reframing thoughts. What would you tell a friend who was hesitant to reach out for support because they didn't want to be a burden?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that friends want to support each other, and that reaching out is a sign of strength, not a burden.\n\nTherapist: That's a wise and compassionate response. Can you try applying that same logic to yourself?\n\nPatient: When you put it that way, it does seem a bit silly to not reach out. I guess I can try to reframe my thoughts around that, too.\n\nTherapist: It's not silly at all \u2013 it's a very common concern. But you're right, reframing those thoughts can be helpful. And even if it feels uncomfortable at first, reaching out for support is a great way to practice challenging those thoughts and building connections with others.\n\nPatient: I can see how reaching out could help challenge those thoughts. I'll try to keep that in mind and maybe make a plan to reach out to a friend this week.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. And remember, you can always start small \u2013 even a short conversation can be a step in the right direction.\n\nPatient: Starting small feels more manageable. Thank you for the encouragement.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Speaking of steps, let's take a moment to review what we've discussed so far. We've talked about continuing to practice cognitive restructuring, looking for evidence to support reframed thoughts, remembering that thoughts are not facts, practicing self-compassion, and reaching out for support. Does that sound like a good summary so far?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's a great summary. It's helpful to hear it all laid out like that.",
