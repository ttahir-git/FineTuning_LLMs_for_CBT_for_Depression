  "transcript": "Therapist: You've shown a lot of insight and willingness to try new techniques today, Alexis. I'm really encouraged by your progress. As we wrap up our session, I want to spend a few minutes discussing some homework assignments that can help you continue practicing these skills between now and our next session.\n\nPatient: Homework assignments sound good. I'm ready to keep working on this.\n\nTherapist: Great! First, I'd like you to continue practicing the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique whenever you notice yourself feeling overwhelmed by emotions. Try to do it at least once a day, even if you're not feeling particularly overwhelmed, just to get more comfortable with the process.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can do that. Once a day seems manageable.\n\nTherapist: Next, I'd like you to practice deep breathing with the counting or calming phrase, again aiming for at least once a day. You can do it at the same time as the grounding technique, or at a separate time.\n\nPatient: Deep breathing once a day, got it. I'll try to do it at a separate time, just to spread out the practice.\n\nTherapist: That's a good idea. Spreading out the practice can help build the habit. Lastly, I'd like you to make a list of people you can reach out to for support, and what you might say to them. Try to actually reach out to at least one person before our next session.\n\nPatient: Making a list and reaching out to someone \u2013 that's a bit more challenging, but I know it's important. I'll do my best.\n\nTherapist: I know it's challenging, but I believe you can do it. And remember, it's okay if it feels awkward or uncomfortable at first. That's part of the process of building a new habit.\n\nPatient: You're right. I'll try to remember that when I'm feeling nervous about reaching out.\n\nTherapist: Before we end our session, I want to check in with how you're feeling now. What's your mood like, and do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better than when we started. Still some sadness and anxiety, but also more hopeful. I feel like I have some new tools to try, and that gives me a sense of control.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and empowered. Those are really positive signs. And it's okay that there's still some sadness and anxiety \u2013 that's to be expected. The important thing is that you're making progress, and you have tools to keep moving forward.\n\nPatient: Thank you for reminding me that it's okay to still feel some sadness and anxiety. I guess I just want to feel better overnight, but I know that's not realistic.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it's not realistic to expect overnight changes. But every small step you take is moving you in the right direction. And over time, those small steps add up to big changes.\n\nPatient: I'll try to remember that. Small steps, not overnight changes.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And if you ever need a reminder of that, feel free to reach out between sessions. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I'll do my best with the homework and check in with you next session.\n\nTherapist: I look forward to hearing about your progress next session. Take care, Alexis.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed the patient's experience with cognitive restructuring and engaging in creative activities with self-compassion\n  - Discussed challenges with consistency in applying techniques and managing overwhelming emotions\n  - Introduced grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1 method and deep breathing) to help manage overwhelming emotions\n  - Discussed the importance of reaching out for support and making a plan to do so\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Cognitive restructuring (continuing from previous sessions)\n  - Engaging in creative activities with self-compassion (continuing from previous sessions)\n  - Grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1 method and deep breathing)\n  - Planning for reaching out for support\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Practice the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique at least once a day\n  - Practice deep breathing with counting or a calming phrase at least once a day\n  - Make a list of people to reach out to for support and what to say\n  - Reach out to at least one person for support before the next session\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - The patient reported feeling more hopeful and equipped to handle negative thoughts after the session\n  - The patient resonated with the concept of challenging cognitive distortions and approaching creative activities with self-compassion\n  - The patient's depression symptoms, including feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, continue to be a challenge, but there are signs of progress in developing more adaptive coping strategies\n  - The patient's passion for photography and desire to connect with others remain important strengths to build upon\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - The patient's core belief related to not being good enough or being a failure was discussed in a previous session\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue to explore and challenge cognitive distortions related to comparing oneself to others\n  - Monitor progress with cognitive restructuring skills, self-compassion practices, and engaging in creative activities\n  - Address any new challenges or concerns that may arise between sessions\n  - Follow up on the patient's experience with grounding techniques and reaching out for support\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review homework and discuss any insights or challenges that came up\n  - Continue to build on skills for managing self-critical thoughts, cognitive distortions, and overwhelming emotions\n  - Explore any new challenges or concerns that may have come up since the last session\n  - Discuss the patient's experience with reaching out for support and any barriers that arose",
