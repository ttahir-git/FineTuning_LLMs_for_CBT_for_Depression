  "transcript": "Patient: Yes, that definitely resonates with me. I've been struggling with feeling like I've lost my sense of purpose since retiring and my children moving out. It's like I'm not sure who I am anymore or what I should be doing with my life.\n\nTherapist: That's a very common experience for many people who have undergone significant life changes, such as retirement or children leaving home. It's important to recognize that this is a normal response to a major transition, and it doesn't mean that you have lost your value or purpose. In fact, this can be an opportunity to explore new aspects of yourself and find new sources of meaning and fulfillment.\n\nPatient: I understand that intellectually, but it's hard to feel that way emotionally. I just feel so stuck and unsure of how to move forward.\n\nTherapist: That's where setting specific, measurable goals can be very helpful. By identifying concrete steps you can take to build a new sense of purpose and meaning, you can start to create a roadmap for yourself. Let's think about some areas of your life where you might want to set goals. You mentioned that photography and mentoring are important to you - could those be areas where you could set some goals?\n\nPatient: Definitely. I would love to get back into photography more seriously, maybe even exhibit some of my work. And I've been thinking about volunteering or mentoring in some capacity, perhaps working with LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like wonderful goals that align with your values and interests. Let's break those down into smaller, more specific goals that we can work towards in therapy. For example, a goal related to photography could be to dedicate a certain amount of time each week to practicing your skills or working on a specific project. And for mentoring, a goal could be to research local organizations that work with LGBTQ+ youth and reach out to inquire about volunteer opportunities. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds really good. I like the idea of breaking it down into smaller steps, it feels more manageable that way.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And as we work towards these goals, we can use CBT techniques to help you identify and challenge any negative thoughts or beliefs that might be getting in the way. One technique we can start practicing today is thought recording, which involves writing down your negative thoughts and then examining the evidence for and against them. This can help you start to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'm willing to give it a try. Can you walk me through how to do it?\n\nTherapist: Sure. First, whenever you notice yourself having a negative thought, write it down. Then, rate how much you believe that thought on a scale of 0-100. Next, write down the evidence that supports the thought, as well as the evidence against it. Finally, based on the evidence, come up with a more balanced thought and re-rate how much you believe the original thought.\n\nPatient: So, for example, if I have the thought \"I'm not good enough to exhibit my photography,\" I would write that down and rate how much I believe it. Then I would write down the evidence for and against that thought, like the fact that I've been practicing photography for years and have received positive feedback, but also the fact that I haven't exhibited before and I'm not sure if my work is at that level. And then I would come up with a more balanced thought, like \"I may not have exhibited before, but I have skills and experience that are valuable, and it's worth putting myself out there.\"\n\nTherapist: That's exactly right! You've got the hang of it. As we continue to practice this technique, you'll start to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective, which can help you feel more confident and motivated to pursue your goals.\n\nPatient: I'm looking forward to giving it a try. It feels good to have a plan and some concrete steps to take.\n\nTherapist: I'm really glad to hear that. Remember, change is a process, and it's okay if progress feels slow or uneven at times. The important thing is that you're taking steps in the right direction, and we'll be here to support you every step of the way.",
