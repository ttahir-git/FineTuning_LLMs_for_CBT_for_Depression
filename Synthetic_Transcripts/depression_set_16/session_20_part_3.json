  "transcript": "Patient: If I start to struggle after therapy ends, I think I could reach out to my support system for help. I could also try to do some of the activities that I know usually help me, like photography or cooking. And I could review my therapy notes and coping cards to remind myself of the skills I've learned.\n\nTherapist: Those are all excellent strategies, Alexis. Reaching out to your support system is so important. Who are the people in your life that you feel comfortable turning to for support?\n\nPatient: I'm close with my siblings, so I could reach out to them. I also have a couple of friends from the support group that I think I could talk to. And there's always the option of scheduling a booster session with you if I need it.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you have those options for support. And you're absolutely right, scheduling a booster session is always an option if you feel you need some extra support. I'm here for you.\n\nPatient: That's good to know. I'm feeling a little more confident about handling things after therapy ends. But I'm still feeling some anxiety about it.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel some anxiety about ending therapy. It's a big transition. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. What thoughts are coming up for you around ending therapy?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm worried that without the structure and support of our sessions, I'll start to backslide. I'm afraid that I haven't made as much progress as I think I have, and that I'll end up right back where I started.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, Alexis. Those fears are very common when ending therapy. But I want to remind you of how far you've come. You've made significant progress in challenging negative thoughts, prioritizing self-care, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and purpose. And you've developed a robust set of skills and tools that you can continue to use going forward.\n\nPatient: You're right, I have made a lot of progress. It's just hard to believe it sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's where those coping cards can come in handy. When you're feeling doubtful, you can pull them out and remind yourself of your progress and your capabilities. And remember, progress isn't always linear. There may be ups and downs, but that doesn't mean you're backsliding. It's just part of the process.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I guess I need to work on being more compassionate with myself when I have setbacks.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Self-compassion is key. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would extend to a good friend who was struggling. You deserve that same care and consideration.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. I guess I'm also feeling a little sad about ending our sessions. I've really appreciated the support and guidance you've provided.\n\nTherapist: It's natural to feel some sadness about ending our work together. We've built a strong therapeutic relationship, and it's okay to grieve the ending of that. At the same time, I want to emphasize that the progress you've made is yours. You've done the hard work, and you have the skills and tools to continue moving forward. Our sessions may be ending, but your journey continues.\n\nPatient: That's a nice way to think about it. I feel like I have a good foundation to build on now.\n\nTherapist: You absolutely do, Alexis. I have complete confidence in your ability to continue using the skills you've learned and to handle whatever challenges come your way. Remember, you can always come back for a booster session if you need a little extra support. My door is always open.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. That means a lot to me. I feel like I'm ready to take on this next chapter.\n\nTherapist: I'm so glad to hear that, Alexis. Let's take a moment to review the key points from our discussion today, and then we can start wrapping up our final session together.",
