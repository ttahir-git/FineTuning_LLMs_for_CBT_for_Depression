  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by discussing your upcoming volunteering experience at the community center. Can you tell me more about the feelings of nervousness and excitement you mentioned earlier?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm excited because I think it will be a great opportunity to meet new people and feel like I'm making a difference in my community. But I'm also nervous because I haven't done anything like this before, and I'm worried that I won't be good at it or that people won't like me.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel both excited and nervous when trying something new. Let's explore these feelings a bit more. What specific thoughts are contributing to your nervousness?\n\nPatient: I guess I'm worried that I won't know what to do or say, and that people will think I'm not capable or competent. I'm also worried that I won't fit in or that I'll feel like an outsider.\n\nTherapist: Those are valid concerns, Alexis. Let's look at them through the lens of cognitive distortions. It sounds like you might be experiencing some \"fortune telling\" \u2013 predicting negative outcomes without evidence. We've also talked about your core belief of not being good enough. Can you see how these thoughts might be influencing your feelings of nervousness?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can see that. I'm assuming that things will go badly before I've even started, and I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself to be perfect.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Now, let's try to reframe these thoughts in a more balanced way. What would you say to a friend who expressed similar concerns about starting a new volunteer position?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that everyone feels nervous when starting something new, and that it's okay to make mistakes or not know everything right away. I'd remind them that they have valuable skills and experiences to offer, and that people will appreciate their efforts.\n\nTherapist: That's a great perspective, Alexis. Can you try applying that same compassion and understanding to yourself?\n\nPatient: I can try. It's harder to do that for myself, but I know it's important.\n\nTherapist: It takes practice, but you're making great progress. Remember, you don't have to be perfect, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Let's discuss some specific strategies for managing your nervousness as you start volunteering. What do you think might help you feel more prepared and confident?\n\nPatient: I think it would help to remind myself that everyone has to start somewhere, and that I'm not expected to know everything right away. I can also try to focus on the reasons why I wanted to volunteer in the first place \u2013 to connect with others and make a positive impact.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent strategies, Alexis. Focusing on your values and goals can be a powerful motivator. Another helpful technique is visualization. Imagine yourself successfully completing your first day of volunteering \u2013 how do you feel? What are you doing? By creating a positive mental image, you can start to build confidence and reduce anxiety.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I can picture myself feeling proud of myself for taking this step and maybe even making a new friend or two.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Alexis. Visualization can be a powerful tool for managing anxiety and building self-efficacy. Remember, you have the skills and strengths to handle this new challenge, and it's okay to take it one day at a time.\n\nNow, let's shift gears and discuss the challenges you've been experiencing with motivation for self-care. You mentioned feeling tired and not seeing the point in doing things just for yourself. Can you tell me more about that?",
