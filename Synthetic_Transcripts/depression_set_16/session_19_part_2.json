  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I don't have anything else to add right now.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your homework from last session. How did you find the gratitude practice and scheduling self-care activities into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: The gratitude practice has been helpful. It's nice to take a moment each day to reflect on the good things, even if they're small. Scheduling self-care has been more challenging. I've been able to do it some days, but other days I just feel too tired or like I don't deserve the time for myself.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that the gratitude practice has been beneficial for you. It's a great way to shift our focus to the positive aspects of our lives. Regarding self-care, it's understandable that it's been more challenging. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and feelings that come up when you try to engage in self-care activities?\n\nPatient: Well, I often feel guilty for taking time for myself when there are so many other things I could be doing, like helping my family or being productive in some way. I also sometimes feel like I haven't earned the right to relax or do something just for me.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alexis. Those thoughts and feelings are very common, but they can make it difficult to prioritize self-care. Let's explore this further. When you say you feel guilty, what thoughts are going through your mind in those moments?\n\nPatient: I think things like \"I should be doing something more important\" or \"I'm being selfish by taking this time for myself.\"\n\nTherapist: I see. And when you have those thoughts, how do they make you feel?\n\nPatient: They make me feel guilty, anxious, and sometimes even a bit ashamed.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense. And what do you usually do when you feel that way?\n\nPatient: I often end up skipping the self-care activity and doing something else instead, like chores or checking in on my family.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like these thoughts and feelings are leading to behaviors that aren't aligned with your goal of prioritizing self-care. This is a great opportunity to practice some of the CBT skills we've been working on. Let's start by examining those thoughts more closely. When you think \"I should be doing something more important,\" what would you say is the underlying belief behind that thought?\n\nPatient: I guess the underlying belief is that my needs aren't as important as other people's needs, or that I'm not worthy of taking time for myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Alexis. This belief that your needs aren't as important or that you're not worthy of self-care is something we call a core belief in CBT. Core beliefs are deeply held beliefs about ourselves, others, and the world that often develop early in life and can influence our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The good news is that we can work on challenging and changing these core beliefs over time.",
