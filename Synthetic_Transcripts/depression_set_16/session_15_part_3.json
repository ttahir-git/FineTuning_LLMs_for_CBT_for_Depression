  "transcript": "Therapist: You've been doing a great job engaging with the techniques we've been practicing, Alexis. I want to delve a bit deeper into the connections between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, especially when it comes to the regrets and worries that have been keeping you up at night.\n\nLet's take the thought we worked on earlier, about feeling like you should have been a better parent. When you have that thought, what emotions do you notice coming up?\n\nPatient: Well, like we talked about before, I feel a lot of guilt. But there's also sadness, and maybe a little bit of fear or anxiety.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so guilt, sadness, and anxiety. And how would you say those emotions influence your behavior, both in the moment and in general?\n\nPatient: In the moment, I might end up lying in bed for hours, just stewing in those feelings and unable to sleep. And in general, I think those emotions might make me more hesitant to reach out to my kids, because I feel like I don't deserve their love or forgiveness.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important insight, Alexis. Our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected, and they can influence each other in a kind of feedback loop. The thought that you weren't a good enough parent leads to feelings of guilt, sadness, and anxiety, which then influence your behavior, like avoiding reaching out to your kids.\n\nBut the good news is that we can interrupt that feedback loop at any point. By challenging the thought, like we did with the thought record, we can start to shift the emotions and behaviors that go along with it.\n\nAnother way to interrupt the loop is to focus on changing the behavior directly. For example, what do you think would happen if you made a point of reaching out to one of your kids this week, even if you're feeling guilty or anxious about it?\n\nPatient: I guess it might show me that my fears aren't totally founded. Like, maybe they wouldn't be as upset with me as I think they would be.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And how do you think that might affect your thoughts and feelings about being a good parent?\n\nPatient: It might help me see that I'm not as bad of a parent as I think I am. And that might help me feel a little less guilty and anxious.\n\nTherapist: That's the idea. By changing our behavior, we can start to gather evidence that challenges our negative thoughts and shifts our emotions. It's a process, and it takes practice, but it can be a powerful way to break out of those negative feedback loops.\n\nLet's try a behavioral experiment related to this. This week, I'd like you to choose one small way to reach out to one of your kids, even if you're feeling guilty or anxious about it. It could be a phone call, a text, or even just sending a card or a small gift. The key is to do it even if you don't feel totally comfortable or confident.\n\nAfter you've done that, I want you to pay attention to how it feels, and what actually happens. Does it give you any new information or evidence about your relationship with your kids, or about yourself as a parent? We can discuss it at our next session.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can try that. I've been meaning to call my daughter anyway, so maybe I'll make a point to do that this week, even if I'm feeling nervous about it.\n\nTherapist: That sounds great, Alexis. Remember, the goal isn't to be perfect or to have a perfect interaction. It's just to practice reaching out and gathering new evidence, even if it feels uncomfortable at first.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about this experiment, or about anything else we've discussed today?\n\nPatient: No, I think it makes sense. It's just hard to put into practice sometimes, when I'm really in the thick of those negative thoughts and feelings.\n\nTherapist: That's totally understandable, Alexis. And that's why we're practicing these skills together, so you can start to build that muscle of challenging your thoughts and changing your behaviors, even when it's hard.\n\nRemember, you don't have to do this perfectly, and you don't have to do it all at once. Every small step you take is progress, and it's all part of the process of building a more balanced and fulfilling life for yourself.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and encouragement. It helps to know that I'm not alone in this, and that it's okay to take it one step at a time.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alexis. I'm here for you every step of the way. And I have faith in your ability to keep making progress, even when it feels challenging.\n\nLet's keep practicing these skills together, and keep exploring the connections between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The more we understand those connections, the more tools we have to create positive change in your life.",
