  "transcript": "Here is part 3 of 4 for CBT session 8 with Dr. Alexis Rivera:\n\nTherapist: Let's continue practicing challenging all-or-nothing thinking with another example from your week. Can you think of another situation where you noticed this cognitive distortion?\n\nPatient: Yes, actually. A few days ago, I was working on a photography project, trying to capture the essence of my neighborhood. I had this vision in my mind of the perfect shot, but I couldn't quite get it right. After several attempts, I got frustrated and started thinking, \"I'm not a good photographer. I can't even capture a simple scene.\"\n\nTherapist: That's another great example of all-or-nothing thinking. Your mind jumped from struggling with one particular shot to the conclusion that you're not a good photographer at all. Let's break this down using the thought record. First, what emotions did you notice when you had that thought?\n\nPatient: I felt really discouraged and frustrated with myself. I also felt a bit hopeless, like I'd never be able to capture the shots I wanted.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you experienced frustration, discouragement, and hopelessness. How intense were those emotions on a scale of 0 to 100?\n\nPatient: I'd say the frustration was around 80, the discouragement around 75, and the hopelessness around 60.\n\nTherapist: Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm not a good photographer. I can't even capture a simple scene.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: The evidence that supports it is that I couldn't get the shot I wanted, even after several attempts. I also sometimes struggle with the technical aspects of photography, like getting the lighting and composition just right.\n\nTherapist: Alright, those are valid points. Now, what about evidence against the thought? Are there any experiences or information that suggest you are a good photographer, even if you struggle with certain shots?\n\nPatient: Well, I have had people compliment my work in the past, and I've even had a few of my photos featured in local exhibitions. I also know that photography is a skill that takes practice and patience, and even professional photographers don't always get the perfect shot on the first try.\n\nTherapist: Excellent points! Those are strong pieces of evidence against the thought. Just because you struggled with one particular shot doesn't mean you're not a good photographer overall. In fact, the recognition you've received for your work and the understanding that photography takes practice are evidence that you have skill and potential in this area. Now, based on the evidence for and against the thought, how could you reframe or modify it to be more balanced and realistic?\n\nPatient: I could reframe it as something like, \"I'm a skilled photographer, but I'm struggling with this particular shot. It's normal to have challenges and not every photo will be perfect. I can keep practicing and learning, and I have evidence that I'm capable of taking great photos.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic reframe, Alexis! It acknowledges the challenge you're facing while also recognizing your skills and the normalcy of imperfection. How do the emotions of frustration, discouragement, and hopelessness feel now, after reframing the thought?\n\nPatient: They feel less intense. I'd say the frustration is now around 40, the discouragement around 30, and the hopelessness around 20.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in your emotional state, just from challenging the all-or-nothing thought and finding a more balanced perspective. This is a great example of how our thoughts can influence our emotions, and how we can use cognitive restructuring to improve our mood and overall well-being.\n\nPatient: It's really helpful to see it laid out like this. I can see how catching these thoughts and challenging them can make a big difference in how I feel.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! And with practice, it becomes easier to notice these cognitive distortions and reframe them in the moment. Speaking of practice, let's discuss how you can apply this skill to situations as they come up in real-time. One strategy is to set aside a few minutes each day to reflect on your thoughts and emotions. If you notice any all-or-nothing thinking or other cognitive distortions, you can use the thought record to challenge them. Another strategy is to set a reminder on your phone or write a note to yourself to \"check your thoughts\" at regular intervals throughout the day. This can help you catch distortions as they happen and reframe them in the moment. What do you think about these strategies? Do you have any other ideas for how you can practice challenging cognitive distortions in real-time?\n\nPatient: Those are great ideas. I like the idea of setting aside time each day to reflect on my thoughts and emotions. I think I could do that in the evening, as part of my wind-down routine before bed. And setting reminders throughout the day is a good way to stay mindful of my thoughts and catch distortions as they happen. I could also try journaling about my thoughts and feelings, and using the thought record to challenge any distortions I notice.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent strategies, Alexis! Incorporating thought reflection into your daily routine and using reminders and journaling to stay mindful of your thoughts are great ways to practice cognitive restructuring in real-time. As you continue to practice, you'll likely find it becomes more automatic and natural to catch and challenge cognitive distortions as they arise.",
