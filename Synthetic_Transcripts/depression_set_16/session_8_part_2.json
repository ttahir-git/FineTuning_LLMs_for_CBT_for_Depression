  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for CBT session 8 with Dr. Alexis Rivera:\n\nPatient: One example of all-or-nothing thinking from this week was when I decided to go for a walk in the park to get some fresh air and exercise. I had planned to walk for 30 minutes, but after about 15 minutes, I started feeling tired and decided to head back home. As soon as I got home, I found myself thinking, \"I'm so out of shape. I couldn't even complete a simple 30-minute walk. I'll never be able to get back in shape and feel better.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Alexis. I can see how that thought pattern fits with all-or-nothing thinking. You set a goal of walking for 30 minutes, but when you didn't meet that exact goal, your mind jumped to the conclusion that you're completely out of shape and will never be able to improve. Let's take a step back and look at this situation more objectively. First, what are some of the positive aspects of the experience that you might be overlooking?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose the fact that I got out of the house and went for a walk at all is a positive. There have been many days where I didn't even make it that far. And I did manage to walk for 15 minutes, which is better than nothing.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Those are great points. Recognizing and acknowledging the positive aspects of a situation, even if they seem small, is an important part of challenging all-or-nothing thinking. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'll never be able to get back in shape and feel better.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: I guess the evidence that supports it is that I've been struggling with my mood and motivation for a while now, and I haven't been able to stick to a regular exercise routine. I also have moments where I feel really tired and discouraged, like I did on that walk.\n\nTherapist: Okay, those are valid points. Now, what about evidence against the thought? Are there any experiences or information that suggest you might be able to improve your fitness and mood, even if it's challenging?\n\nPatient: Well, I have had times in the past where I was able to exercise regularly and felt better overall. And even though I've been struggling lately, I have been making progress in therapy and learning new skills. I suppose that could be evidence that change is possible, even if it's slow.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Those are excellent examples of evidence against the thought. Just because you're struggling now doesn't mean you'll never be able to improve. In fact, the progress you've made in therapy and the small steps you're taking, like going for a walk, are evidence that you're capable of making changes, even if they're gradual. Now, based on the evidence for and against the thought, how could you reframe or modify it to be more balanced and realistic?\n\nPatient: I could reframe it as something like, \"I'm struggling with my fitness and mood right now, but I'm taking small steps to improve, and I've made progress in the past. It might take time and effort, but I can work towards feeling better and getting back in shape.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Alexis! It acknowledges the current challenges while also recognizing your progress and potential for improvement. How does that reframed thought feel compared to the original all-or-nothing thought?\n\nPatient: It feels more hopeful and less discouraging. The original thought made me feel like giving up, but the reframed thought makes me feel like I can keep trying, even if it's hard.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. Challenging all-or-nothing thinking and finding more balanced perspectives can have a big impact on our emotions and motivation. Let's practice this skill with a few more examples from your week, and then we can discuss how to apply it to situations as they come up in real-time.",
