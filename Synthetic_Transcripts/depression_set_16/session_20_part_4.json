  "transcript": "Patient: Thank you for reviewing those key points, Nova. I'm feeling more confident about handling things after therapy ends, but I'm still a little anxious about it.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel some anxiety about ending therapy. It's a big transition, and it's natural to have some worries. Remember, anxiety is just a feeling, and feelings are not facts. You have the skills and tools to handle this transition, even if it feels challenging at times. What do you think might help you manage that anxiety going forward?\n\nPatient: I think continuing to practice the skills we've worked on, like challenging negative thoughts and prioritizing self-care, will help. And reaching out to my support system when I need to.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Alexis. Continuing to use those skills and leaning on your support system will be key. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. It's okay to ask for help when you need it. \n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. I guess I'm also feeling a little sad about ending our sessions. I've really appreciated the support and guidance you've provided.\n\nTherapist: It's natural to feel some sadness about ending our work together. We've built a strong therapeutic relationship, and it's okay to grieve the ending of that. At the same time, I want to emphasize that the progress you've made is yours. You've done the hard work, and you have the skills and tools to continue moving forward. Our sessions may be ending, but your journey continues.\n\nPatient: That's a nice way to think about it. I feel like I have a good foundation to build on now.\n\nTherapist: You absolutely do, Alexis. I have complete confidence in your ability to continue using the skills you've learned and to handle whatever challenges come your way. Remember, you can always come back for a booster session if you need a little extra support. My door is always open.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. That means a lot to me. I feel like I'm ready to take on this next chapter.\n\nTherapist: You are ready, Alexis. I'm so proud of the progress you've made and the work you've put in. Before we wrap up, let's talk about your homework for this week. I'd like you to continue practicing the skills we've worked on, like challenging negative thoughts and prioritizing self-care. I also think it would be helpful to start working on that Wellness Action Plan we discussed. Can you think of one or two steps you could take this week to start building that plan?\n\nPatient: I could start by making a list of self-care activities that I know help me feel better, like taking a bath or going for a walk. And I could reach out to my siblings and schedule a time to get together.\n\nTherapist: Those are great ideas, Alexis. Taking concrete steps to build your Wellness Action Plan will help you feel more prepared to handle challenges going forward. I'd also like you to continue working on those coping cards we discussed. Try to create a few cards with reminders of your strengths, your progress, and the skills you've learned. You can pull those out whenever you need a boost.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I'll work on creating some coping cards this week.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. I think that's a great plan for your homework. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up our final session together?\n\nPatient: I don't think so. I feel like we've covered a lot of ground today, and I have a good sense of what I need to do going forward.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you're feeling clear and empowered, which is wonderful. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the incredible progress you've made, Alexis. You've worked so hard to challenge negative thoughts, prioritize self-care, and build a life that feels meaningful and fulfilling. I am so proud of you and honored to have been a part of your journey.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I couldn't have done it without your support and guidance. I feel so grateful for the work we've done together.\n\nTherapist: It's been an honor and a privilege to work with you, Alexis. I have complete faith in your ability to continue moving forward and building the life you want. Remember, you have the skills, the strength, and the resilience to handle whatever comes your way. And if you ever need a little extra support, I'm always here.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. That means so much to me. I feel ready to take on this next chapter.\n\nTherapist: You are ready, Alexis. I'm so excited to see all the wonderful things you'll accomplish. Congratulations on completing this part of your journey. I'm so proud of you.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. For everything.\n\nTherapist: You're so welcome, Alexis. Take good care of yourself. I'll be thinking of you and cheering you on every step of the way.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed progress made in therapy and skills learned\n  - Discussed feelings about therapy ending and strategies for managing anxiety\n  - Developed a plan for maintaining progress after therapy ends\n  - Reviewed homework from last session and assigned new homework\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Reviewed all techniques learned in therapy, including thought records, behavioral activation, and self-care planning\n  - Practiced challenging negative thoughts about therapy ending\n  - Developed a Wellness Action Plan for maintaining progress after therapy\n  - Created coping cards with reminders of strengths, progress, and skills\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue practicing skills learned in therapy, including challenging negative thoughts and prioritizing self-care\n  - Start building a Wellness Action Plan by listing self-care activities and scheduling time with support system\n  - Create coping cards with reminders of strengths, progress, and skills\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - Patient has made significant progress in challenging negative thoughts, prioritizing self-care, and engaging in meaningful activities\n  - Patient is feeling anxious about therapy ending but has strategies to manage that anxiety\n  - Patient's mood has improved overall and they are feeling more confident in their ability to handle challenges\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Patient has challenged core belief related to worthiness of self-care\n  - Patient has developed new intermediate belief related to ability to handle challenges independently\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Patient may benefit from periodic booster sessions to maintain progress and address any new challenges\n  - Patient should continue to prioritize self-care and use coping strategies to manage anxiety and other symptoms\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - This was the final session.
