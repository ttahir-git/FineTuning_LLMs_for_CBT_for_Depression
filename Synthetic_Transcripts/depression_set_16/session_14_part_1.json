  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alexis, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or notable experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the grounding techniques and reach out for support like we discussed. It hasn't been easy, but I've noticed small improvements in my ability to manage overwhelming emotions. However, I've also been struggling with feelings of guilt and worthlessness, especially when I compare myself to others who seem to be handling retirement and empty nest syndrome better than I am.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the grounding techniques and reaching out for support. It's a significant step forward, and small improvements are worth acknowledging. I understand that feelings of guilt and worthlessness can be challenging, especially when comparing yourself to others. Let's explore those feelings further today.\n\nFor our agenda, I suggest we:\n\n1. Discuss your experience with the homework and any challenges or insights that came up.\n2. Explore the feelings of guilt and worthlessness you mentioned, and how they might be related to comparing yourself to others.\n3. Continue building on skills for managing self-critical thoughts and cognitive distortions.\n4. Check in on your progress with cognitive restructuring, self-compassion practices, and engaging in creative activities.\n5. Discuss any new challenges or concerns that may have come up since the last session.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
