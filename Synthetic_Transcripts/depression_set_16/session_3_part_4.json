  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up our session today, I want to review the goals and treatment plan we've established. We've identified specific goals related to photography, mentoring, and building connections, which we'll work towards while also focusing on challenging negative thoughts and building new skills. How are you feeling about this plan?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling good about it. It feels manageable and aligned with what I want to work on. I appreciate how collaborative the process has been.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Collaboration is key in therapy, and I'm committed to working with you to support your goals. Before we end today, let's assign some homework to help you continue practicing the skills we've discussed.\n\nPatient: Okay, what do you have in mind?\n\nTherapist: I'd like you to continue practicing thought recording, just like we discussed earlier. Try to do it at least once a day, or whenever you notice yourself having a negative thought. Additionally, I'd like you to take one concrete step towards one of your goals. That could be researching photography clubs or classes, looking into volunteer opportunities, or reaching out to a friend or family member to connect.\n\nPatient: That sounds doable. I'll definitely prioritize the thought recording, and I'll try to take at least one step towards my goals as well.\n\nTherapist: That's great. Remember, the key is consistency and practice. It's okay if the steps are small, as long as you're moving in the right direction.\n\nPatient: I'll keep that in mind. Thank you for all your support and guidance today.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Alexis. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's plan to meet again in a week to check in on your progress and continue our work together.\n\nPatient: Sounds good. I'm looking forward to it.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed goals and treatment plan related to photography, mentoring, and building connections\n  - Discussed the importance of collaboration in therapy\n  - Assigned homework to practice thought recording and take concrete steps towards goals\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought recording: Patient will practice identifying negative thoughts, rating belief in them, examining evidence for and against, and developing a more balanced thought\n  - Goal setting: Patient will take one concrete step towards a goal related to photography, mentoring, or building connections\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Practice thought recording at least once a day or whenever a negative thought is noticed\n  - Take one concrete step towards a goal, such as researching photography clubs/classes, looking into volunteer opportunities, or reaching out to connect with someone\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - Patient is struggling with feelings of worthlessness and purposelessness since retiring and children moving out\n  - Patient has identified goals related to photography, mentoring, and building connections\n  - Patient is motivated to engage in therapy and homework, but may struggle with perfectionism and self-criticism\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue to explore and challenge cognitive distortions\n  - Monitor progress and adjust goals and homework as needed\n  - Address perfectionism and self-criticism as they arise\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review homework and discuss any insights or challenges that came up\n  - Continue to work on challenging negative thoughts and building new skills\n  - Check in on progress towards goals and adjust plan as needed",
