  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you explaining the connections between my thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It's starting to make more sense to me, even though it's still hard to put into practice sometimes.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad it's starting to click, Alexis. And you're right, it can be challenging to apply these concepts in the moment, especially when we're feeling overwhelmed by strong emotions. That's why we practice together, and why we start with small steps.\n\nSpeaking of small steps, I'd like to introduce a new technique that can help with managing overwhelming emotions. It's called \"Opposite Action,\" and it involves intentionally doing the opposite of what your emotions are telling you to do.\n\nFor example, if you're feeling anxious about reaching out to your kids, your instinct might be to avoid or postpone that interaction. With Opposite Action, you would intentionally choose to reach out, even though it feels uncomfortable.\n\nThe idea is that by doing the opposite of what your emotions are telling you to do, you can start to shift those emotions, and gather new evidence that challenges your negative thoughts.\n\nWhat do you think about that concept, Alexis? Does it resonate with you at all?\n\nPatient: It makes sense in theory, but it sounds really hard to do in practice. Like, if I'm feeling really anxious or down, the last thing I want to do is push myself to do something that feels uncomfortable.\n\nTherapist: That's a totally valid concern, Alexis. And you're right, Opposite Action can be challenging, especially at first. That's why we start small, and we choose actions that feel manageable.\n\nFor example, if reaching out to your kids feels too overwhelming, you could start with something smaller, like sending a quick text or email, or even just thinking about reaching out without actually doing it.\n\nThe key is to gradually build up your tolerance for discomfort, and to practice doing the opposite of what your emotions are telling you to do, even if it's just in small ways at first.\n\nWhat do you think, Alexis? Is there a small way you could practice Opposite Action this week, maybe related to reaching out to your kids or engaging in an activity that feels meaningful?\n\nPatient: I guess I could start by just sending a quick text to my daughter, even if I don't feel totally comfortable with it. And maybe I could look into that photography class we talked about, even if I'm not sure I'm ready to sign up yet.\n\nTherapist: Those are great ideas, Alexis! Sending a quick text and looking into the photography class are both manageable steps that challenge your instinct to avoid or postpone. And even if they feel small, they can start to shift your emotions and gather new evidence over time.\n\nRemember, the goal isn't to feel totally comfortable or confident right away. It's just to practice doing the opposite of what your emotions are telling you to do, and to see what happens when you do.\n\nI'd like you to add those two Opposite Action steps to your homework for this week, in addition to the thought record and worry time techniques we discussed earlier. We can check in about how it went at our next session.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can try that. It's still a little scary, but I see how it could be helpful in the long run.\n\nTherapist: It's totally normal to feel scared or hesitant, Alexis. And that's okay! The key is to practice taking small steps forward, even when it feels uncomfortable. And remember, you don't have to do this alone. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nBefore we wrap up, I want to check in about how you're feeling now. What's your mood like, and what thoughts and emotions are coming up for you?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a little overwhelmed, to be honest. We covered a lot today, and it's a lot to take in and try to apply. But I'm also feeling a little bit hopeful, like maybe these techniques could actually help me start to feel better.\n\nTherapist: It's totally understandable to feel overwhelmed, Alexis. We did cover a lot today, and it's a lot to process and put into practice. And I'm glad to hear that you're also feeling a little bit hopeful. That's a great sign that these concepts are resonating with you, even if it feels challenging to apply them at first.\n\nRemember, you don't have to do everything perfectly, and you don't have to do it all at once. Every small step you take is progress, and it's all part of the process of building a more balanced and fulfilling life for yourself.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to:\n\n1. Practice using a thought record whenever you notice yourself dwelling on past regrets or feeling guilty about your parenting.\n\n2. Try out the \"worry time\" technique, setting aside 15-20 minutes each day to write down your worries and concerns.\n\n3. Send a quick text to your daughter, and look into the photography class we discussed, as practice for Opposite Action.\n\n4. Continue to explore ideas for finding a sense of purpose and meaning in retirement, like volunteering at the LGBTQ+ community center.\n\nWe'll check in about how it went at our next session, and we'll keep practicing these skills together. Remember, change is a process, and it's okay to take small steps forward. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nHow does that sound, Alexis? Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework, or about anything else we discussed today?\n\nPatient: No, I think it all makes sense. It's just a matter of actually doing it, which is the hard part. But I appreciate you breaking it down into small steps, and reminding me that it's okay to take it slow.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alexis. And you're right, the actual doing is often the hardest part. But that's why we practice together, and why we celebrate every small step forward.\n\nI have faith in your ability to keep making progress, even when it feels challenging. And I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nSession Summary:\n\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed the connections between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and how they influence each other in a feedback loop\n  - Introduced the concept of Opposite Action, and discussed how to apply it in small ways to challenge negative emotions and gather new evidence\n  - Checked in about the patient's current mood and any final thoughts\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought record to challenge negative thoughts related to past regrets and parenting guilt\n  - \"Worry time\" technique to manage insomnia related to racing thoughts or anxiety\n  - Opposite Action to intentionally do the opposite of what emotions are telling you to do, in order to shift those emotions and gather new evidence\n  - Behavioral experiment of reaching out to patient's daughter, to challenge negative thoughts and beliefs about parenting\n  - Continued exploration of finding a sense of purpose and meaning in retirement, through activities like photography or volunteering\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Practice using a thought record whenever the patient notices themselves dwelling on past regrets or feeling guilty about their parenting\n  - Try out the \"worry time\" technique, setting aside 15-20 minutes each day to write down worries and concerns\n  - Send a quick text to the patient's daughter, and look into the photography class discussed in session, as practice for Opposite Action\n  - Continue to explore ideas for finding a sense of purpose and meaning in retirement, like volunteering at the LGBTQ+ community center\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - The patient is starting to understand the connections between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, but finds it challenging to apply the concepts in the moment\n  - The patient is feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information covered in session, but also a little bit hopeful that the techniques could help them start to feel better\n  - The patient's main challenges continue to be insomnia, feelings of guilt and regret related to parenting, and difficulty finding a sense of purpose in retirement\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - The patient's core belief related to not being good enough or being a failure was discussed in a previous session\n  - The patient's intermediate belief related to feeling like they should have been a better parent was explored in this session\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue to monitor the patient's progress with using thought records, worry time, and Opposite Action techniques\n  - Follow up on the patient's behavioral experiment of reaching out to their daughter, and explore any new evidence or insights that came up\n  - Continue to explore the patient's ideas for finding a sense of purpose and meaning in retirement, and support them in taking small steps towards those goals\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review homework and discuss any insights or challenges that came up\n  - Continue to build on skills for managing negative thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, through techniques like thought records, Opposite Action, and behavioral experiments\n  - Explore any new challenges or concerns that may have come up since the last session\n  - Discuss the patient's progress with finding a sense of purpose and meaning in retirement, and support them in taking small steps towards their goals",
