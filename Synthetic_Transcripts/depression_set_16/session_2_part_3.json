  "transcript": "Therapist: It's common to struggle with accepting positive things about ourselves, especially when we're dealing with depression. It's something we can work on together in therapy. I'm curious, what do you think might be getting in the way of believing positive things about yourself?\n\nPatient: I think it's partly because of my perfectionism. I always feel like I could be doing better or that I'm not good enough.\n\nTherapist: Perfectionism can definitely make it hard to accept compliments or acknowledge our own positive qualities. It's like we're constantly moving the goalposts, so we never feel like we're measuring up. In our work together, we can explore where this perfectionism might be coming from and develop strategies to challenge it. Does that feel like something you'd like to work on in therapy?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that would be really helpful. I know my perfectionism is causing me a lot of stress and anxiety.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal for therapy. We can also work on developing more self-compassion and acceptance, which can help counteract the negative effects of perfectionism. Another important part of CBT is setting concrete, achievable goals for therapy. Based on what we've discussed so far, what are some other goals you might have for our work together?\n\nPatient: I'd like to work on finding a sense of purpose and meaning outside of my career and family roles. I feel so lost without those things.\n\nTherapist: That's a really important goal, and one that many people struggle with after retirement or other major life transitions. We can explore your values and interests, and brainstorm ways to find purpose and meaning in this new chapter of your life. What about on a day-to-day basis? What are some goals you have for managing your depression symptoms?\n\nPatient: I'd like to work on getting out of the house more and engaging in activities I enjoy, like photography and mentoring. I know those things make me feel better, but it's hard to motivate myself to do them.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal. We can work on developing a plan for gradually increasing your activity level, starting with small, achievable goals and building up from there. This can help boost your mood and give you a sense of accomplishment. Another important part of CBT is homework assignments between sessions. Homework allows you to practice the skills we discuss in therapy in your daily life. How do you feel about the idea of homework?\n\nPatient: I'm open to it. I know I need to put in the work to feel better. I just worry about not doing it perfectly or not having enough time.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, and it ties back to the perfectionism we discussed earlier. With homework, the goal is not to do it perfectly, but to practice and learn from the experience. We can work together to come up with homework assignments that feel manageable and relevant to your goals. And if you have trouble completing an assignment, that's okay \u2013 we can troubleshoot together and adjust as needed. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: That makes me feel less anxious about it. I like the idea of having some accountability and structure between sessions.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that feels helpful. As we continue to work together, we can tailor the homework assignments to your specific needs and goals. Speaking of which, I'd love to hear more about your experience with photography and mentoring. Those sound like really meaningful activities for you.",
