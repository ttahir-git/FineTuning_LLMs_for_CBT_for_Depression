  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's dive into the first item on our agenda \u2013 practicing cognitive restructuring for the thoughts that keep you up at night. You mentioned that dwelling on past mistakes and regrets is a common theme. Can you share an example of a specific thought that tends to arise when you're trying to sleep?\n\nPatient: One thought that often comes up is, \"I should have been a better parent to my children when they were growing up. I was so focused on my career that I missed out on important moments with them.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alexis. I can hear the regret and self-criticism in that thought. Let's examine it more closely using a thought record. First, let's identify the emotion that accompanies this thought and rate its intensity on a scale of 0-100. What emotion do you feel when you have this thought?\n\nPatient: I feel guilt, and I would rate it around 85 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's write that down. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you should have been a better parent?\n\nPatient: Well, there were times when I had to work late or travel for conferences, and I missed some of my children's school events or performances. I remember them expressing disappointment when I couldn't be there.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, and it's natural to feel some guilt about those moments. Now, let's consider the evidence against this thought. What are some ways in which you were a good parent, even while managing your career?\n\nPatient: I always made sure my children knew I loved them, and I tried to be there for the big moments when I could. I provided for them financially and gave them opportunities I didn't have growing up. And now that they're adults, we have a close relationship, and they've told me they appreciate everything I did for them.\n\nTherapist: That's important to acknowledge, Alexis. It sounds like, despite the challenges of balancing work and family, you were able to show your love and support in meaningful ways. Let's write down those points as evidence against the thought.\n\nNow, let's see if we can come up with an alternative, more balanced thought based on the evidence we've gathered. What's a different way of looking at this situation that takes into account both the evidence for and against the original thought?\n\nPatient: I guess I could say, \"I did my best to be a good parent while also pursuing my career goals. Even though I couldn't be there for every moment, I showed my love and support in other ways, and my children know I care about them.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Alexis. It acknowledges the challenges you faced while also recognizing the efforts you made to be a loving parent. How does this new thought affect the intensity of the guilt you feel?\n\nPatient: When I look at it that way, the guilt feels less intense. Maybe around 50 out of 100.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift, Alexis. It shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing our emotions. By examining the evidence and coming up with a more balanced perspective, we can start to change the way we feel.\n\nI'd like to give you some homework related to this exercise. Over the next week, whenever you notice yourself dwelling on past regrets or feeling guilty about your parenting, I want you to practice using a thought record like we just did. Write down the thought, identify the emotion and its intensity, gather evidence for and against the thought, and come up with an alternative, more balanced thought. Then, re-rate the intensity of the emotion. This will help you start to build the skill of cognitive restructuring on your own.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can try that. It's helpful to have a structured way to challenge these thoughts, rather than just getting stuck in the same negative loop.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, and the more you practice, the more natural it will start to feel. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate these thoughts entirely, but to find a more balanced and realistic way of looking at the situation.\n\nLet's move on to the next item on our agenda \u2013 discussing additional strategies for managing insomnia. In addition to the sleep hygiene strategies we've already talked about, I'd like to introduce a technique called \"worry time.\" This involves setting aside a specific time each day, usually earlier in the evening, to write down any worries or concerns that are on your mind. The idea is to get these thoughts out of your head and onto paper, so they're less likely to keep you up at night.\n\nPatient: That's an interesting idea. I've never thought about scheduling time to worry before.\n\nTherapist: It might seem counterintuitive, but it can be a helpful way to contain those worries and prevent them from spilling over into your bedtime routine. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Choose a specific time each day, at least an hour before bedtime, to be your designated \"worry time.\" It could be right after dinner, or whenever works best for your schedule.\n\n2. Set a timer for 15-20 minutes, and during that time, write down any worries, concerns, or nagging thoughts that come to mind. Don't try to solve the problems or challenge the thoughts, just get them down on paper.\n\n3. When the timer goes off, stop writing and put the list aside. Remind yourself that you'll have another opportunity to address these concerns during your next scheduled worry time.\n\n4. If worries come up at other times of the day, especially at night, remind yourself that you've already dealt with them during your designated worry time, and you can revisit them tomorrow if needed.\n\nThe goal is to train your brain to associate worrying with a specific time and place, rather than letting it take over your thoughts at night. It takes practice, but many people find it helpful for managing insomnia related to racing thoughts or anxiety.\n\nPatient: I'm willing to give it a try. I like the idea of having a designated time to get those thoughts out of my head, rather than letting them swirl around all night.\n\nTherapist: Great, I encourage you to try it out over the next week and see how it goes. Remember, it might feel awkward or challenging at first, but with practice, it can become a helpful tool for managing insomnia.\n\nLet's move on to the final item on our agenda \u2013 exploring ways to find a sense of purpose and meaning in retirement. This is a common challenge for many people after they stop working, and it's something we can continue to work on together.\n\nOne way to start is by identifying your values \u2013 the things that are most important to you in life. This could include things like family, creativity, learning, or giving back to your community. Once you have a clearer sense of your values, we can start to brainstorm activities or pursuits that align with those values and give you a sense of purpose.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I know family is a big value for me, and I've been trying to spend more time with my grandchildren now that I'm retired. But I also miss the sense of accomplishment and contribution I got from my work.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable, Alexis. Work often provides a built-in sense of purpose and structure, and it can be challenging to find that outside of a job. Let's brainstorm some ideas together. What are some activities or pursuits that align with your values and interests, and could give you a sense of purpose?\n\nPatient: Well, I've always enjoyed photography, and I've thought about getting more serious about it now that I have more time. Maybe I could take a class or join a local photography club.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Alexis. Photography could be a way to express your creativity, learn new skills, and maybe even contribute to your community by documenting local events or sharing your work with others.\n\nAnother option could be to explore volunteer opportunities that align with your values and interests. Many organizations are looking for volunteers with specific skills or experience, and it could be a way to give back while also building a sense of purpose.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I've thought about volunteering at the LGBTQ+ community center, since that's a cause that's close to my heart. Maybe I could lead a support group or mentor younger people who are going through similar challenges to what I faced.\n\nTherapist: That could be a wonderful way to draw on your own experiences and skills to help others, Alexis. It's also a way to build connections and find a sense of belonging outside of work.\n\nI encourage you to start exploring some of these ideas over the next few weeks, and we can continue to discuss them in our sessions. Finding a sense of purpose is a process, and it might take some trial and error to figure out what works for you. But by starting with your values and interests, and being open to new experiences, I'm confident you can build a fulfilling life in retirement.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your encouragement and support. It's helpful to have a framework for thinking about this, and some concrete ideas to explore.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alexis. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, retirement is a new chapter in your life, and you have the opportunity to shape it in a way that aligns with your values and brings you a sense of purpose and fulfillment.\n\nLet's recap the main points from our session today:\n\n1. We practiced using a thought record to challenge negative thoughts related to past regrets and parenting guilt, and I encouraged you to continue using this tool on your own over the next week.\n\n2. We discussed the technique of \"worry time\" as a way to manage insomnia related to racing thoughts or anxiety, and you agreed to try it out over the next week.\n\n3. We explored the idea of finding a sense of purpose and meaning in retirement by identifying your values and brainstorming activities or pursuits that align with those values, such as photography or volunteering at the LGBTQ+ community center.\n\nFor homework, I'd like you to:\n\n1. Practice using a thought record whenever you notice yourself dwelling on past regrets or feeling guilty about your parenting.\n\n2. Try out the \"worry time\" technique, setting aside 15-20 minutes each day to write down your worries and concerns.\n\n3. Start exploring some of the ideas we discussed for finding a sense of purpose, such as looking into photography classes or clubs, or reaching out to the LGBTQ+ community center about volunteer opportunities.\n\nWe'll continue to discuss your progress and any challenges that come up in our next session. Remember, change is a process, and it's okay to take small steps forward. I'm here to support you every step of the way.",
