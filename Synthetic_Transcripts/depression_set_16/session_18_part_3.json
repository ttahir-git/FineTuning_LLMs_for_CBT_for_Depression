  "transcript": "Patient: I think part of why I struggle with self-care is that I've always put others' needs before my own. It feels selfish to prioritize myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a common belief, Alexis, and it's understandable given your caring nature and history of supporting others. However, it's essential to recognize that taking care of yourself is not selfish \u2013 it's necessary. Think of it like the oxygen mask analogy: on an airplane, you're instructed to put on your own mask before assisting others. The same principle applies to self-care. By tending to your own needs, you're actually better equipped to support those around you.\n\nPatient: I've never thought about it that way before. It makes sense, but it's still hard to put into practice.\n\nTherapist: Changing long-held beliefs and behaviors takes time and practice. Let's explore some strategies to help you prioritize self-care, even when motivation is low. One effective technique is to schedule self-care activities into your day, just as you would any other important commitment. This helps create structure and reduces the likelihood of pushing it aside when you're feeling tired or unmotivated.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I can try setting aside specific times for things like exercise, cooking, and hobbies.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! Another helpful approach is to reframe self-care as an act of self-compassion rather than a chore. When you engage in self-care, you're nourishing your mind, body, and spirit, which enables you to show up more fully for yourself and others. It's an investment in your overall well-being.\n\nPatient: I like that perspective. It feels more meaningful than just going through the motions.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. To further support this shift in mindset, let's revisit the concept of self-compassion. Remember, self-compassion involves treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would extend to a dear friend. When you notice yourself feeling guilty or resistant to self-care, try speaking to yourself gently, acknowledging your needs, and offering encouragement.\n\nPatient: I'll give it a try. It's definitely a different way of thinking for me.\n\nTherapist: It takes practice, but with time, it will become more natural. Another helpful tool is to create a list of self-care activities that you enjoy and find nourishing. This can include things like taking a warm bath, reading a book, calling a friend, or spending time in nature. Having a go-to list can be helpful when motivation is low, as it provides a menu of options to choose from.\n\nPatient: That's a great idea. I can brainstorm some activities and keep the list handy for when I need it.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful! Remember, self-care doesn't have to be time-consuming or elaborate. Even small acts of kindness towards yourself, like taking a few deep breaths or savoring a cup of tea, can make a big difference in your overall well-being.\n\nNow, let's check in on your gratitude practice and self-compassion exercises from last week's homework. How did those go for you?\n\nPatient: The gratitude practice was helpful. It reminded me of the good things in my life, even when I was feeling down. The self-compassion exercises were more challenging, but I did notice myself being a bit kinder to myself in some situations.",
