  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alexis, it's great to see you for our final session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in our final session together. How have you been since our last meeting?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand and appreciate you sharing those limitations. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I completed the homework you assigned, prioritizing self-care activities and writing a letter to myself. It was challenging at times, but I tried to practice responding to negative thoughts with more helpful ones. I'm feeling a mix of emotions about this being our last session together.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a range of emotions as we approach the end of our time together. I'm glad to hear that you completed the homework and practiced responding to negative thoughts. We'll definitely explore your feelings about our sessions ending further. For now, let's set an agenda for our final session. What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to discuss how I can maintain the progress I've made after our sessions end. I'm also interested in exploring how I can continue to challenge my core belief about the worthiness of self-care. And maybe we could do a brief review of the skills and tools I've gained throughout our time together.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Alexis. I think it's important that we focus on relapse prevention planning, so you feel equipped to manage any challenges that may arise after our sessions end. We can also work on strengthening your ability to challenge that core belief around self-care. And absolutely, let's review the progress you've made and the skills you've developed. This will help reinforce your learning and boost your confidence in your ability to continue using these tools independently. Does this agenda feel comprehensive to you, or is there anything else you'd like to add?",
