  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alexis, it's great to see you again for session 7. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Also, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret any non-verbal cues.\n\nWith that said, I'm fully committed to working with you and supporting your journey through CBT. Before we dive into today's agenda, I'd love to hear how you've been doing since our last session. How has your mood been, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?",
