  "transcript": "Therapist: Self-compassion involves treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a good friend. It's about acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes and has flaws, and that's part of being human. When you find yourself being self-critical, try to pause and ask yourself, \"What would I say to a friend in this situation?\" Then, try to offer those same words of support and understanding to yourself.\n\nPatient: That makes sense, but it's hard to break the habit of being self-critical. I've been doing it for so long.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it is a habit, and like any habit, it takes time and practice to change. One way to start is by noticing when you're being self-critical and labeling those thoughts as \"self-criticism.\" Then, try to reframe those thoughts in a more compassionate way. For example, instead of saying, \"I'm so lazy for not doing more today,\" you could say, \"I'm doing the best I can right now, and that's okay.\"\n\nPatient: I can try that. It's just hard to believe the compassionate thoughts sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. It takes time to build up that self-compassionate voice, especially if the self-critical voice has been dominant for a long time. Remember, you don't have to believe the compassionate thoughts right away. The important thing is to practice offering them to yourself, even if it feels a bit awkward or unnatural at first.\n\nPatient: I'll give it a try. I guess it's like the thought records \u2013 it gets easier with practice.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And speaking of thought records, let's look at another example from your week. Can you share another situation where you noticed a negative thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I had a day where I didn't accomplish much, and I started thinking that I'm never going to get better and that I'm just a burden on everyone.\n\nTherapist: That's a heavy thought to sit with. Let's break it down using the thought record. What emotions did you experience when you had that thought?\n\nPatient: I felt really hopeless and ashamed. I also felt guilty for not doing more and for being a burden.\n\nTherapist: On a scale of 0-100, how intense were those emotions?\n\nPatient: The hopelessness was probably around 85, the shame around 80, and the guilt around 75.\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought that you're never going to get better and that you're a burden on everyone.\n\nPatient: The evidence for the thought is that I've been struggling with depression for a while now, and it feels like nothing is changing. I also feel like I'm not contributing much to my relationships or society in general.\n\nTherapist: And what about the evidence against the thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the evidence against it is that I'm here in therapy, working on getting better. I'm also still engaging with my hobbies and trying to stay connected with my loved ones, even if it's hard sometimes. And just because I'm struggling doesn't mean I'm a burden. I know my family and friends care about me and want to support me.\n\nTherapist: Those are important points. You're taking active steps to work on your mental health, and that's a sign of progress, even if it doesn't always feel that way. And you're right, struggling with depression doesn't make you a burden. Your loved ones care about you and want to support you through this difficult time.\n\nPatient: I know that logically, but it's hard to feel that way sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. Depression can make it hard to see things clearly and can lead to distorted thoughts. That's why we're practicing challenging those thoughts and looking at the evidence. Let's come up with an alternative thought that takes both sides into account.\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be that even though I'm struggling right now, I'm taking steps to work on my mental health, and that's a sign of progress. My loved ones care about me and want to support me, even if I feel like a burden sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic thought. How do you think your emotions would change if you focused on this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I think my hopelessness would go down to around 50, my shame to 40, and my guilt to 30.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant shift in your emotional state, just by challenging the initial negative thought. This is another example of how powerful thought records can be in managing depression.\n\nPatient: It's still not easy, but I can see how this can be helpful. I just wish I could believe the alternative thoughts more easily.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience, and it's something that gets easier with practice. Remember, the goal isn't to get rid of negative thoughts altogether, but to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective. And even if you don't fully believe the alternative thoughts at first, the act of challenging the negative thoughts and considering other possibilities can still have a positive impact on your emotions.\n\nPatient: I'll keep practicing. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's why we're building these skills \u2013 so that over time, it becomes more automatic to notice and challenge negative thoughts. And remember, you don't have to do this perfectly. Every time you practice, you're taking a step in the right direction.\n\nPatient: I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just frustrating sometimes.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel frustrated. Depression is a challenging illness, and recovery is a process. But every small step you take is a step towards feeling better, even if it doesn't always feel that way in the moment.",
