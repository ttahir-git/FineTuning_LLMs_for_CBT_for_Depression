  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alexis, it's great to see you again for our 19th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand and appreciate you sharing those limitations. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I started volunteering at the community center, which has been both exciting and challenging. I've also been trying to prioritize self-care, but it's still a struggle at times. I feel like I'm making progress, but I also feel anxious about our sessions coming to an end soon.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've started volunteering and are making efforts to prioritize self-care. It's also completely normal to feel anxious about our sessions ending. We'll definitely address that today. Before we set our agenda, let's explore a bit more about how you've been feeling. Can you tell me more about your experience with volunteering and the challenges you've faced with self-care?\n\nPatient: Volunteering has been rewarding, but I often feel nervous before going in, worrying that I won't be good enough or that I'll make mistakes. With self-care, I know it's important, but I still struggle with the feeling that I don't deserve it or that I should be focusing on others instead of myself.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alexis. Those feelings of anxiety and self-doubt are completely valid, and we'll work on addressing them today. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to focus on the following topics for our agenda today:\n\n1. Processing your experience with volunteering and challenging the negative thoughts and beliefs that arise\n2. Exploring the challenges with self-care and practicing self-compassion\n3. Discussing your anxiety about our sessions ending and developing a plan for maintaining your progress\n4. Reviewing your homework from last session and setting new homework for this week\n\nHow does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?",
