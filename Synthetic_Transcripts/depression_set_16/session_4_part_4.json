Remember, every small step counts, and it's okay to take things at your own pace. If you find yourself getting stuck or feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out for support. I'm here to help you through this process.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and encouragement. I know it won't be easy, but I'm committed to working on these skills and making progress.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Alexis. Your commitment and willingness to engage in this work are key to your success. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. In addition to our sessions, don't hesitate to lean on your support system, whether that's your family, friends, or the LGBTQ+ support group you mentioned. Having people to talk to and share your experiences with can make a big difference.\n\nPatient: You're right. I sometimes forget how much support I have around me. I'll try to reach out more when I'm feeling down.\n\nTherapist: That's a great idea, Alexis. Connecting with others can be a powerful tool in managing depression. As we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have before our next session?\n\nPatient: No, I think we've covered a lot today. I'm feeling more prepared to work on my homework and take some small steps forward.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Alexis. I'm so glad to hear that. Remember, if anything comes up during the week or if you need support, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here for you. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at our next session.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate it. Have a great week, and I'll see you next time.",
