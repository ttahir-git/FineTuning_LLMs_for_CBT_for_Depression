  "transcript": "Patient: Using the thought records has been helpful, but it's still hard for me to remember to do it in the moment when I'm feeling really down. I find myself getting caught up in negative thoughts before I even realize what's happening.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Alexis. It takes practice to catch those negative thoughts as they're happening. One thing that can help is setting aside a specific time each day to review your thoughts and feelings, like we discussed with the worry time technique. How did that go for you?\n\nPatient: I tried it a few times, but I struggled to keep my mind focused on just worrying during that time. I kept getting distracted by other things, like what I need to do around the house or what I want to make for dinner.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. Our minds can be very busy, especially when we're trying to contain our worries to a specific time. It might help to write down your worries during your worry time, so you can stay focused and not have to hold everything in your head. You could also try setting a timer, so you know you have a specific amount of time to dedicate to worrying, and then you can move on with your day when the timer goes off.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I think writing things down could help me stay on track. And setting a timer would give me a clear boundary between worry time and the rest of my day.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's all about finding what works for you. And remember, it's okay if your mind wanders during worry time. Just gently redirect your attention back to your worries when you notice it happening.\n\nPatient: I'll keep practicing. I know it'll get easier with time.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And the more you practice, the more you'll start to notice patterns in your worries and negative thoughts, which can help you challenge them more effectively.\n\nSpeaking of challenging negative thoughts, let's talk about the Opposite Action experiment we discussed last session. How did it go when you reached out to your daughter?\n\nPatient: It went better than I expected. We had a really nice conversation, and it felt good to connect with her. I realized that a lot of my fears about our relationship were based on assumptions, not reality.\n\nTherapist: That's a powerful insight, Alexis. When we challenge our negative thoughts with actions, we often find that our fears are unfounded. It sounds like taking that Opposite Action of reaching out, even though it felt scary, led to a positive outcome.\n\nPatient: It really did. It made me wonder what other negative thoughts I might be holding onto that aren't actually true.\n\nTherapist: That's a great question to explore. As we continue with therapy, we'll work on identifying and challenging more of those negative thoughts and beliefs. And speaking of beliefs, I'm curious about your thoughts on finding a sense of purpose and meaning in retirement. You mentioned that you've been reflecting on that since our last session.\n\nPatient: Yeah, it's been on my mind a lot. I've been trying to think about what matters most to me and how I can incorporate that into my life now that I'm not working. I love photography, and I've been thinking about getting more involved with the LGBTQ+ community center, maybe volunteering there.\n\nTherapist: Those both sound like meaningful pursuits that align with your values and interests. Volunteering at the community center could be a great way to give back and feel a sense of purpose, while also connecting with others who share your experiences. And photography can be a wonderful creative outlet and form of self-expression.\n\nPatient: I agree. I'm just not sure where to start. It feels overwhelming to think about making big changes like that.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. It can be helpful to break things down into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, you could start by researching volunteer opportunities at the community center and seeing what might be a good fit for you. And with photography, you could set aside a specific time each week to go out and take photos, even if it's just for an hour or two.\n\nPatient: Breaking it down like that makes it feel more doable. I think I could start with those steps.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Alexis. Remember, you don't have to figure everything out at once. It's about taking small, consistent steps towards what matters to you. And as we continue with therapy, we can keep exploring what gives you a sense of purpose and meaning and how to incorporate more of that into your life.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance. It helps to have someone to talk through all of this with.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Alexis. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, change takes time, but with consistent effort and practice, it is possible to feel better and create a life that feels meaningful and fulfilling to you.",
