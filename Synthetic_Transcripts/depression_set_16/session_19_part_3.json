  "transcript": "Patient: It's interesting to think about where that core belief might have come from. I guess growing up in a family where everyone was always working hard and putting others first, I learned that my own needs weren't as important.\n\nTherapist: That's a really valuable insight, Alexis. Our early experiences and the messages we receive from our families and culture can have a big impact on the beliefs we develop about ourselves and the world. The good news is that even though these beliefs are deeply ingrained, we can still work on changing them. One way to start challenging this core belief is to look for evidence that contradicts it. Can you think of any times in your life when prioritizing your own needs actually led to positive outcomes, either for you or for others?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose there have been times when taking care of myself has allowed me to show up better for others. Like when I'm well-rested, I have more patience and energy to support my family and friends.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example! Prioritizing your own well-being can actually enable you to be more present and supportive for the people you care about. This challenges the idea that focusing on your own needs is selfish or unimportant. Another way to start shifting this core belief is to practice self-compassion. How do you think your life might be different if you truly believed that you were worthy of care and compassion, just as much as anyone else?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel less guilty about taking time for myself, and I might be more motivated to engage in self-care activities. I might also be kinder to myself when I make mistakes or face challenges, instead of being so self-critical.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Believing that you are worthy of care and compassion can make it easier to prioritize self-care and be kinder to yourself in difficult moments. This is something we can continue to work on together. Another strategy for challenging core beliefs is to act \"as if\" the new belief were true, even if you don't fully believe it yet. What might it look like to act \"as if\" you believed that your needs were just as important as everyone else's?\n\nPatient: I guess it would mean prioritizing self-care activities, even when I feel guilty about it. It might also mean setting boundaries with others when I need time for myself, and being more assertive about my own needs.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples! Acting \"as if\" you believed in your own worthiness can help you start to gather evidence that challenges the old core belief and supports the new one. It's like an experiment - you try out the new belief and see what happens. Over time, this can help shift your core beliefs in a more helpful direction. What do you think about trying out some of these strategies this week?\n\nPatient: I'm willing to give it a try. It will probably be challenging at first, but I can see how it could be helpful in the long run.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're open to experimenting with these strategies. Remember that it's okay if it feels uncomfortable or difficult at first - that's actually a sign that you're challenging the old belief! I'm here to support you through this process. Let's come up with a specific plan for how you might practice acting \"as if\" this week. What are one or two self-care activities you could prioritize, even if you feel guilty about it?",
