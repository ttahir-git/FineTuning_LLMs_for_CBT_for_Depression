  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Alexis, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the self-compassionate self-talk and the \"double standard\" technique when I notice self-critical thoughts. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some progress. I also picked up my camera and took some photographs, which felt good, but I still struggled with self-judgment at times.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on the techniques we discussed and that you've noticed some progress. It's completely normal to face challenges and have setbacks along the way. What stood out to you most about your experience with self-compassionate self-talk and the \"double standard\" technique?\n\nPatient: I found the \"double standard\" technique particularly helpful. When I caught myself being self-critical, I tried to imagine what I would say to a friend in a similar situation. It helped me recognize that I often hold myself to a much higher standard than I would others. The self-compassionate self-talk was more challenging, but I'm trying to be more patient with myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful insight, Alexis. Recognizing the double standard you hold for yourself is a significant step towards developing more self-compassion. It's okay if the self-compassionate self-talk feels more challenging right now. Like any new skill, it takes practice and patience. Let's explore your experience with photography a bit more. What thoughts and feelings came up for you while taking photographs?\n\nPatient: When I first picked up my camera, I felt a mix of excitement and anxiety. I was excited to reconnect with my passion, but I also worried that my skills might have diminished since I haven't been practicing regularly. As I started taking photographs, I found myself getting caught up in thoughts like, \"This isn't good enough\" or \"I should be able to do better.\"\n\nTherapist: It's common for self-critical thoughts to arise when we're engaging in activities that are important to us, especially if we haven't practiced them in a while. Let's take a closer look at one of those thoughts, like \"This isn't good enough.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought, and what evidence do you have against it?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose the evidence that supports the thought is that my photographs might not be as technically proficient as they once were. I'm also comparing my work to other photographers I admire, which can make me feel inadequate. However, the evidence against the thought is that I know creativity isn't just about technical skill. It's also about self-expression and capturing moments that are meaningful to me. When I look at my photographs from a more compassionate perspective, I can see the beauty and value in them, even if they're not perfect.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic point, Alexis. Creativity is a deeply personal experience, and comparing our work to others can often fuel self-criticism. You've identified a key piece of evidence against the thought that your photographs aren't good enough \u2013 the fact that they hold meaning and beauty for you. Let's continue to explore this idea as we move forward in our session today.\n\nFor our agenda, I'd like to propose the following:\n\n1. Review your experience with the homework exercises and discuss any challenges or insights that came up.\n2. Continue building on skills for managing perfectionism, self-criticism, and overwhelming emotions.\n3. Explore any new challenges or concerns that may have come up since the last session.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
