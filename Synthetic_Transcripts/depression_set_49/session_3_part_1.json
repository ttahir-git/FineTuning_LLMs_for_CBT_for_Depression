  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you back for our third session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few important things about our work together. As an AI therapist, I have some limitations - I can't access any information about you beyond what you share with me in our sessions. I also might sometimes generate inaccurate information or misunderstand things. If that happens, please let me know so we can clarify. And while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever feel you're in crisis, it's vital to reach out to a human professional or emergency services right away. Do you have any questions about that?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for explaining that. I'm ready to get started with today's session.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by setting an agenda for our time together. I'd like to review the homework from our last session and discuss your experience with the thought records. We'll also work on finalizing our conceptualization of your depression from a CBT perspective. And I'd like to start the process of setting some specific, measurable goals for your therapy. How does that sound? Is there anything else you'd like to make sure we cover today?",
