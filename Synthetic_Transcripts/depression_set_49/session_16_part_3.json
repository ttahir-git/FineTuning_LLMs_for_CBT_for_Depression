  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made a great point about starting small, Amir. Smiling at a stranger or saying hello to a neighbor are excellent ways to begin testing out your negative predictions and gathering evidence. These small interactions can help build your confidence and provide evidence that you can handle social situations. What do you think about setting a goal to engage in one small social interaction like this before our next session?\n\nPatient: Setting a goal like that feels manageable. I think I could handle smiling at a stranger or saying hello to a neighbor. It's a small step, but it's a step in the right direction.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Amir. Small steps can lead to big changes over time. Remember, every piece of evidence you gather, no matter how small, is helping you challenge your negative beliefs and build more balanced and accurate ones. I'm excited to hear about your experiences with this goal at our next session.\n\nPatient: I'm nervous, but I'm also looking forward to seeing what happens. It feels good to have a concrete goal to work towards.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel nervous, Amir. Stepping outside of our comfort zone is always a bit scary. But I'm confident that you can handle this goal, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, you can always reach out if you need encouragement or guidance.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. Knowing that I have your support makes it feel a bit less daunting.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Amir. I'm always here for you. Now, let's take a moment to review what we've discussed today. We talked about the importance of continuing to practice thought records and self-compassion affirmations, even when it feels challenging. We also discussed the value of testing out negative predictions and gathering real evidence to challenge assumptions. And we set a goal for you to engage in one small social interaction before our next session. How are you feeling about all of this?",
