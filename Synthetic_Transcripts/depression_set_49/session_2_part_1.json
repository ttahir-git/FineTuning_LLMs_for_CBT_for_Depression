  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's good to see you again. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm feeling a bit low today, to be honest. I tried working on the thought records as homework, but I found it challenging to identify and challenge my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Amir. It's common to find this exercise challenging at first. Would it be okay if we start by reviewing some of the thought records you worked on? We can go through them together and discuss any difficulties you faced.\n\nPatient: Sure, that sounds good. I have them here with me.\n\nTherapist: Great. Before we begin, let's set an agenda for today's session. In addition to reviewing your homework, I'd like to introduce the CBT framework and explore your specific thought patterns related to depression. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I'm curious to learn more about the CBT framework.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. Let's start by looking at one of the thought records you brought today. Can you share an example of a situation that triggered negative thoughts and emotions for you?",
