  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made a great point about starting with a friend you feel more comfortable with. Let's explore that a bit further. Can you think of a specific friend you might feel more at ease reaching out to first?\n\nPatient: I think my friend Lina would be a good person to start with. We've known each other for a long time, and she's always been very understanding and non-judgmental.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great choice. Now, let's think about what you might say when you reach out to Lina. What would you feel comfortable sharing with her about your current situation and why you've been less in touch lately?\n\nPatient: I could start by just letting her know that I've been going through a tough time lately, and that I've been struggling with my mental health. I can explain that I've been feeling withdrawn and that it's been hard for me to reach out, but that I value our friendship and want to reconnect.\n\nTherapist: That's a great approach. You're being honest about your struggles while also expressing your appreciation for your friendship. How do you think Lina might respond to that?\n\nPatient: I think she would probably be understanding and supportive. She might even share her own experiences with mental health challenges, as I know she's had her own struggles in the past.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point. It's likely that Lina will be able to relate to your experiences on some level, and that can help deepen your connection. Now, let's think about how you can cope if the conversation does feel a bit awkward at first. What could you do in that moment to manage any anxiety or discomfort?\n\nPatient: I could try to focus on my breathing and remind myself that it's okay if it's not perfect. I can also try to listen actively to what Lina is saying and ask her questions about her own life, so the focus isn't entirely on me.\n\nTherapist: Those are great strategies. Focusing on your breathing can help calm your nervous system, and asking Lina about herself can take some of the pressure off you. Remember, it's okay if there are moments of silence or if the conversation doesn't flow perfectly. The important thing is that you're making an effort to reconnect.\n\nPatient: That's true. I guess I just need to be patient with myself and the process.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. It's a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about your sleep hygiene and stimulus control. You mentioned that you're still struggling with consistency in those areas. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been challenging?",
