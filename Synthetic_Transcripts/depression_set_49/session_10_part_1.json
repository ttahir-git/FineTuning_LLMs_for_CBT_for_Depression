  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you again for our 10th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a crisis situation, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted individual in your life. Lastly, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With all that said, I'm fully committed to supporting you in your journey towards better mental health and well-being. Now, let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your commitment to helping me. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the sleep hygiene strategies we discussed. It's been challenging to break old habits, but I've noticed some improvements in my sleep quality. However, I've also been feeling a bit more anxious lately, especially when it comes to social interactions and reaching out to friends.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on your sleep hygiene and noticing some improvements. It's common for progress to feel slow and challenging at times, but every small step counts. I also appreciate you sharing about your increased anxiety around social interactions. Let's make sure to discuss that further today. How about we start by setting an agenda for our session? What would you like to prioritize today, in addition to discussing your sleep hygiene progress and the anxiety you've been experiencing?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'd also like to talk more about the alternative belief we developed last time, about balancing relaxation and consistent sleep. I've been trying to practice it, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. And maybe we could explore some of the thoughts and feelings that come up for me around social interactions?\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, those are great topics to focus on today. So, our agenda includes:\n1. Reviewing your progress with sleep hygiene strategies\n2. Discussing the increased anxiety around social interactions\n3. Exploring your experience with practicing the alternative belief about balancing relaxation and consistent sleep\n4. Identifying and challenging any negative thoughts related to social interactions\n\nDoes this agenda feel comprehensive to you, or is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main things on my mind right now. Let's start with the sleep hygiene progress.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's begin there. Can you tell me more about the changes you've made to your sleep environment and bedtime routine since our last session? What strategies have you been able to implement, and how have they been working for you?",
