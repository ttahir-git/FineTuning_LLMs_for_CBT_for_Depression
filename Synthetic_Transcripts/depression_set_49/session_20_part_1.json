  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misunderstand something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a crisis situation, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted person in your life. Lastly, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like facial expressions or body language. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I've been doing alright, Nova. I've been trying to practice the skills we've discussed, like cognitive restructuring and compassionate self-talk. It's been challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making progress. I shared my relapse prevention plan with another friend, and they were really supportive.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've worked on and that you've found support in sharing your relapse prevention plan. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling emotionally and what your mood has been like since our last session?\n\nPatient: My mood has been relatively stable, with some ups and downs. I've had moments where I feel really hopeful and motivated, but there are also times when I feel overwhelmed and start to doubt myself. I try to use the coping cards when I notice those negative thoughts creeping in.\n\nTherapist: It's normal to have ups and downs, and it's great that you're using the coping cards to help manage those moments of self-doubt. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have challenging days. What about your engagement in valued activities, like singing and language learning? How has that been going?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to engage more in those activities, but it's still a struggle sometimes. I get caught up in thinking that I need to be perfect at them, and then I start to lose motivation. But I've been trying to remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that the process of learning is valuable in itself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Amir. Recognizing that perfectionism can hinder your engagement in valued activities is an important step. Remember, the goal is not to be perfect but to find joy and fulfillment in the process of learning and growing. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to discuss how I can continue to work on my perfectionism and self-critical thoughts, especially in social situations. I also want to talk about how I can maintain my progress after our sessions end.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on. I suggest we start by reviewing your experiences with cognitive restructuring and compassionate self-talk in social situations and relationships. Then, we can explore strategies for maintaining your progress and addressing perfectionism. We'll also touch on relapse prevention planning. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me, Nova. I'm ready to get started.",
