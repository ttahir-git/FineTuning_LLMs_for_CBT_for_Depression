  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Amir, it's great to see you again for our 18th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I strive to provide evidence-based support, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to supporting you in our work together. \n\nTo start, how have you been since our last session? I'd love to hear about any changes, challenges, or successes you've experienced.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to apply the cognitive restructuring techniques we discussed, particularly around my negative thoughts about singing and language learning. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some progress in catching those thoughts and reframing them. However, I've still struggled with motivation and getting myself to engage in those activities consistently.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the cognitive restructuring techniques and noticing some progress. Building awareness and reframing negative thoughts is a crucial step in the process. At the same time, I understand that motivation and consistent engagement can be challenging, especially when depression is involved. We can definitely explore this further today.\n\nGiven what you've shared, what would you like to prioritize in our session today? We could discuss your experiences with the homework, delve into the motivation challenges, or explore any other topics that feel relevant to you.\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on the motivation challenges, as that feels like the biggest hurdle for me right now. I want to engage in singing and language learning, but I often find myself struggling to get started or maintain consistency. We could also touch on my experiences with the homework, but I feel the motivation issue is the most pressing.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Amir. We can definitely focus on exploring and addressing the motivation challenges, as that seems to be a key area impacting your ability to engage in meaningful activities. We can also briefly discuss your experiences with the homework to see if there are any insights or adjustments we can make.\n\nHere's a proposed agenda for our session today:\n1. Explore motivation challenges related to singing and language learning\n2. Discuss experiences with homework and any insights or adjustments\n3. Identify strategies to increase motivation and engagement in valued activities\n4. Set goals and homework for the coming week\n\nHow does this agenda feel to you? Is there anything you'd like to add or modify?",
