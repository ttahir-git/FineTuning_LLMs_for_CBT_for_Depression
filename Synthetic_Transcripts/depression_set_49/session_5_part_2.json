  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate your support, Nova. The insomnia has been really tough to deal with. Even when I try to go to bed at a reasonable time, I find myself lying awake for hours, unable to shut off my thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Insomnia can be incredibly frustrating, and it's common for people with depression to experience sleep difficulties. The thoughts that keep you awake at night are likely related to some of the negative thought patterns we've been discussing. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that tend to keep you up at night?\n\nPatient: Well, I often find myself dwelling on past mistakes and regrets. I think about my divorce and how I might have done things differently. I also worry about the future and whether I'll ever find happiness and fulfillment again.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like some heavy thoughts, Amir. It's understandable that they would keep you awake at night. I want to introduce a concept called \"cognitive distortions.\" These are common thinking patterns that can contribute to negative emotions and keep us stuck in a cycle of rumination. One example of a cognitive distortion is \"catastrophizing,\" where we imagine the worst possible outcome of a situation. Another is \"rumination,\" where we dwell on negative experiences or emotions. Do any of these resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, I can definitely see how I engage in catastrophizing and rumination, especially when I'm lying in bed at night.\n\nTherapist: Recognizing these cognitive distortions is an important first step. Now, let's discuss some strategies for managing them. One technique we can use is called \"thought challenging.\" This involves examining the evidence for and against a particular thought and coming up with a more balanced perspective. For example, when you find yourself catastrophizing about the future, you could ask yourself, \"What evidence do I have that this worst-case scenario will actually happen?\" and \"Is there another way of looking at this situation that's more realistic?\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can try to challenge those thoughts when they come up.\n\nTherapist: Great! Another technique that can be helpful for managing rumination is called \"scheduled worry time.\" This involves setting aside a specific time each day to focus on your worries and concerns. Outside of that designated time, you practice redirecting your attention to the present moment. This can help break the cycle of rumination and improve your sleep quality.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I can try setting aside 20 minutes each evening to write down my worries and concerns.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan, Amir. Remember, it takes practice to change these thinking patterns, so be patient with yourself. In addition to these cognitive techniques, there are also some behavioral strategies we can use to improve your sleep quality. One is called \"stimulus control,\" which involves creating a strong association between your bed and sleep. This means using your bed only for sleep and intimacy, and getting up to do a calming activity if you're unable to fall asleep within 20-30 minutes.\n\nPatient: I've heard of that before, but I've never really tried it consistently. I can give it a shot.\n\nTherapist: Consistency is key with stimulus control. It can take a few weeks to see improvements, but it's a very effective strategy for many people. Another behavioral technique is called \"sleep hygiene,\" which involves creating an environment and routine that promotes good sleep. This includes things like keeping your bedroom dark and cool, avoiding screens for an hour before bed, and establishing a regular sleep schedule.\n\nPatient: I think I could definitely improve my sleep hygiene. I tend to watch TV or scroll on my phone right before bed, which probably isn't helping.\n\nTherapist: Making small changes to your sleep hygiene can have a big impact on your sleep quality. Let's set some specific goals related to stimulus control and sleep hygiene for the coming week. What changes do you feel ready to make?\n\nPatient: I can commit to using my bed only for sleep and intimacy, and getting up to read a book in the living room if I can't fall asleep within 30 minutes. I can also aim to stop using screens an hour before bed and establish a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like great goals, Amir. Remember to start small and be patient with yourself. It's okay if you don't see changes overnight. I'm confident that with consistent practice, you'll start to see improvements in your sleep quality over time.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel more hopeful knowing that there are concrete steps I can take to manage my insomnia.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Amir. Insomnia is a challenging issue, but you've shown a lot of resilience and willingness to try new strategies. Let's keep monitoring your sleep quality over the next few weeks and adjust our approach as needed. In the meantime, let's shift gears and talk about the argument you had with your friend and how it impacted your thoughts about yourself.",
