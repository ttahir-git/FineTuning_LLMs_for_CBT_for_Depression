[Sets agenda priority]\n\nTherapist: That's a great choice, Amir. We can definitely focus on strategies to help you manage your anxiety during your meeting with your friend. Let's start by discussing the behavioral experiment we planned last session. Were you able to follow through with responding to your friend's text and setting up the meeting? [Focuses on patient's priority, follows up on homework]\n\nPatient: Yes, I did respond to their text, and we agreed to meet for coffee this weekend. It was challenging, but I reminded myself of the alternative thought we discussed, that my friend values our relationship and wants to spend time with me. [Reports completion of homework, shares challenges and coping strategy]\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Amir! It's great to hear that you were able to follow through with the experiment despite the challenges. How did you feel after setting up the meeting? [Reinforces success, explores emotional response]\n\nPatient: I felt a sense of relief and even a bit of excitement. It was nice to know that I had taken a step towards reconnecting with my friend. [Shares positive emotions]\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful that you experienced relief and excitement after setting up the meeting. This shows that facing your anxiety and engaging in the experiment had a positive impact on your emotions. [Highlights connection between behavior and emotions]\n\nAs you prepare for your meeting with your friend, let's discuss some strategies you can use to manage your anxiety during the interaction. One helpful technique is to focus on the present moment and engage in mindful listening. This means paying attention to what your friend is saying and your own thoughts and feelings without judgment. How do you think this strategy could be helpful for you? [Introduces mindfulness strategy, encourages patient reflection]\n\nPatient: I think focusing on the present moment could help me stay engaged in the conversation and not get too caught up in my anxious thoughts. It might also help me feel more connected to my friend. [Reflects on potential benefits of mindfulness]\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Mindful listening can help you stay grounded in the present and foster a deeper connection with your friend. Another strategy is to practice self-compassion during the interaction. If you notice yourself having negative thoughts or feeling anxious, try offering yourself some kind words or understanding, just as you would to a good friend. What are some self-compassionate phrases you could use? [Introduces self-compassion strategy, encourages patient participation]\n\nPatient: I could remind myself that it's okay to feel anxious and that I'm doing my best. I could also tell myself that my friend cares about me and that our relationship can handle some awkward moments. [Generates self-compassionate phrases]\n\nTherapist: Those are great self-compassionate phrases, Amir! Reminding yourself that it's okay to feel anxious and that your friend cares about you can help ease some of the pressure you may be feeling. [Reinforces self-compassion]\n\nAnother helpful strategy is to plan some topics of conversation ahead of time. This can give you a sense of preparedness and reduce anxiety about not having anything to say. What are some topics you could bring up during your meeting? [Introduces conversation planning strategy]\n\nPatient: I could ask my friend about their recent vacation, or share some updates about my language learning and singing. We also have some shared interests, like trying new restaurants, so I could bring that up. [Identifies potential conversation topics]\n\nTherapist: Those sound like great conversation topics, Amir! Having a few ideas in mind can help you feel more confident going into the meeting. Remember, it's okay if there are moments of silence or if the conversation doesn't flow perfectly. The most important thing is that you're showing up and making an effort to connect with your friend. [Reinforces conversation planning, provides reassurance]\n\nAs you continue to prepare for your meeting, I encourage you to practice the strategies we've discussed: mindful listening, self-compassion, and conversation planning. These tools can help you manage your anxiety and engage more fully in the interaction. [Summarizes strategies, encourages practice]\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel more prepared now and less anxious about the meeting. I'll definitely practice these strategies. [Expresses gratitude and reduced anxiety]\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Amir! I'm glad you're feeling more prepared and less anxious. Remember, it's normal to still feel some anxiety, but you have the tools to manage it. I have confidence in your ability to handle this interaction and strengthen your friendship. [Provides validation and encouragement]\n\nLet's continue discussing your upcoming meeting and any other concerns you have. How else can I support you today?
