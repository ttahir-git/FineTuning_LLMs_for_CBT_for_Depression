  "transcript": "Patient: The agenda sounds good to me. I don't have anything else to add at the moment.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your thought records. Were you able to complete them since our last session? If so, can you share any insights or challenges you encountered while challenging negative thoughts and beliefs?\n\nPatient: I did complete some thought records, but I found it challenging to do them consistently. I often got caught up in my negative thoughts and forgot to pause and challenge them in the moment.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Priya. Building the habit of pausing and challenging negative thoughts takes practice. Let's look at one of the thought records you were able to complete. Can you walk me through an example?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I had a thought that \"I'm not doing enough at work, and my colleagues must think I'm lazy.\" This thought led me to feel anxious and guilty, and I ended up staying late at work to compensate.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example. Let's break it down using the CBT triangle. The thought \"I'm not doing enough at work, and my colleagues must think I'm lazy\" led to feelings of anxiety and guilt, which then influenced your behavior of staying late at work. In your thought record, were you able to challenge this thought?\n\nPatient: I tried to challenge it by looking at the evidence. I reminded myself that I consistently meet my deadlines and receive positive feedback from my supervisor. I also tried to consider alternative perspectives, like the fact that my colleagues may not be thinking about my work performance at all.\n\nTherapist: That's great that you were able to challenge the thought using evidence and alternative perspectives. How did that impact your feelings and actions in that moment?\n\nPatient: When I challenged the thought, I noticed that my anxiety and guilt decreased a bit. I still ended up staying late at work, but I was able to leave earlier than I initially planned.\n\nTherapist: That's progress, Priya. Challenging negative thoughts can help reduce the intensity of negative emotions and lead to more balanced behaviors. It's okay if you didn't completely change your behavior in that moment. The goal is to gradually shift your thoughts and feelings in a more helpful direction.\n\nPatient: I can see how challenging thoughts can be helpful, but it's still difficult for me to do it consistently. I often get stuck in negative thought patterns without even realizing it.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. It takes practice to build the skill of challenging negative thoughts. One technique that can be helpful is to set aside dedicated time each day to review your thoughts and challenge any negative ones. This can be a few minutes in the morning or evening, or even during a break at work.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea. I think setting aside time each day would help me be more consistent with challenging my thoughts.\n\nTherapist: Let's set that as a goal for the coming week. Can you commit to setting aside 10 minutes each day to review your thoughts and complete a thought record?\n\nPatient: Yes, I can commit to that. I'll try to do it during my lunch break at work, since that's when I often notice my negative thoughts creeping in.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. Remember, the more you practice, the easier it will become to challenge negative thoughts in the moment.",
