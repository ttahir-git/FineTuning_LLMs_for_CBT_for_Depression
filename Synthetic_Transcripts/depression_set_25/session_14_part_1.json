  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes in your mood or experiences?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations as an AI. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the stress management techniques we discussed, particularly setting boundaries at work and practicing relaxation exercises. It's been challenging, but I do notice some improvement in my overall stress levels. However, I still find myself struggling with perfectionism and negative self-talk.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on implementing the stress management techniques and noticing some improvements. Challenging perfectionism and negative self-talk can be a difficult process, but the fact that you're aware of these patterns is an important first step. Let's explore this further today.\n\nFor our agenda, I suggest we start by reviewing your thought records and discussing any insights or challenges you encountered with challenging perfectionism and setting realistic goals. We can also check in on your progress with self-care activities, such as painting, and explore any changes in your mood or stress levels. Additionally, we can discuss any adjustments needed to your treatment plan based on your experiences and progress. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I did bring my thought records, and I'm eager to discuss them with you. I've also been trying to set aside time for painting, but it's been difficult to prioritize it with my busy work schedule. I'm hoping we can explore some strategies to help me balance my work and self-care.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely discuss strategies for balancing work and self-care. It's a common challenge, and finding that balance is crucial for managing stress and promoting overall well-being.\n\nLet's start by reviewing your thought records. Can you share some of the negative thoughts related to perfectionism that you've been working on challenging?",
