  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I had a situation at work last week where I made a small mistake on a project. My initial thought was, \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right.\" It led to feelings of worthlessness and sadness.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Priya. Let's break this down using the thought record. In the situation column, you would write about the mistake you made at work. Under emotions, you listed worthlessness and sadness. For the automatic thought, you identified \"I'm such a failure. I can't do anything right.\" Now, let's look at the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I did make a mistake on the project, and it needed to be corrected. My boss pointed it out in a team meeting, which was embarrassing.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so the evidence for the thought is that you made a mistake, and your boss pointed it out. Now, let's consider the evidence against this thought. What are some examples of times when you have done things right at work?\n\nPatient: When I think about it, I've successfully completed many projects in the past. I often receive positive feedback from colleagues and clients. I've even been promoted twice in the last five years.\n\nTherapist: Great! Those are strong pieces of evidence against the thought that you can't do anything right. Now, let's look at the alternative thought column. Based on the evidence for and against, how can you reframe this thought in a more balanced way?\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought would be, \"I made a mistake, but everyone makes mistakes sometimes. One mistake doesn't define my entire work performance or my worth as a person.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent alternative thought, Priya. It acknowledges the mistake but also recognizes that it doesn't negate your overall competence and value. Now, let's look at the outcome. When you consider this alternative thought, how do the emotions of worthlessness and sadness change in intensity?\n\nPatient: When I think about it that way, the feelings of worthlessness and sadness decrease. I still feel a bit embarrassed about the mistake, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation. By reframing the thought in a more balanced way, the intensity of the negative emotions decreases. This is the power of challenging cognitive distortions. With practice, it will become easier to catch these thoughts in the moment and reframe them. Does this example help clarify the process of using thought records?",
