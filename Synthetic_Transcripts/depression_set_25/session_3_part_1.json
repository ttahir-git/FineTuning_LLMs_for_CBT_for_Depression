  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our third session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Today, I'm feeling a bit low, but I'm hopeful that our session will help me gain some clarity and tools to cope with my depression.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're here, and I appreciate your honesty about how you're feeling. Let's start by reviewing your homework from the last session. Were you able to keep a thought record and practice reframing your thoughts?\n\nPatient: Yes, I did my best to keep a thought record. It was challenging at times, but I managed to record at least one or two thoughts per day, along with the situation and associated emotions. I also tried to identify cognitive distortions, like all-or-nothing thinking and overgeneralization.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Would you be comfortable sharing an example of a thought you recorded and how you reframed it?\n\nPatient: Sure. One situation that triggered negative thoughts was when I received feedback from my boss on a project. My initial thought was, \"I'm not good enough, and I'll never succeed in my career.\" I recognized this as all-or-nothing thinking and overgeneralization. I tried to reframe it as, \"This is an opportunity to learn and grow. One piece of feedback doesn't define my entire career.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent example of identifying and challenging cognitive distortions. Reframing your thoughts in a more balanced and realistic way can help reduce the intensity of negative emotions. Let's continue to practice this skill throughout our sessions.\n\nNow, I'd like to discuss our agenda for today's session. We'll review your thought records in more detail, finalize the CBT conceptualization of your depression, and begin setting specific, measurable goals for therapy. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm ready to dive deeper into understanding my depression and setting goals to work towards.\n\nTherapist: Great. Let's start by reviewing your thought records. Can you share any patterns or insights you noticed while keeping track of your thoughts and emotions?",
