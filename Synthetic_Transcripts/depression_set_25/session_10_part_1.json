  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 10. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like reframing guilty thoughts and prioritizing self-care. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some improvements in my mood and overall well-being. I'm still struggling with sleep disturbances and feelings of worthlessness, but I'm trying to be patient with myself.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been implementing the techniques we've discussed and have noticed some improvements in your mood and well-being. It's understandable that you're still facing challenges with sleep disturbances and feelings of worthlessness. Being patient with yourself is crucial during this process. Let's explore your experiences further. Can you share a specific situation where you practiced reframing guilty thoughts related to self-care or setting boundaries?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I decided to take a mental health day from work because I was feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. Initially, I felt guilty for prioritizing my own needs over my work responsibilities, but I tried to reframe those thoughts. I reminded myself that taking care of my mental health is just as important as my physical health and that I can't pour from an empty cup.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of reframing guilty thoughts related to self-care. Recognizing the importance of prioritizing your mental health and well-being is a significant step forward. How did you feel after taking the mental health day and practicing this reframing technique?\n\nPatient: After taking the mental health day and reframing my thoughts, I felt a sense of relief and rejuvenation. I realized that giving myself permission to rest and recharge actually helped me be more productive and present when I returned to work. It was a valuable lesson in self-compassion and setting boundaries.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that you experienced relief and rejuvenation after taking the mental health day and practicing reframing. Recognizing the benefits of self-compassion and setting boundaries is a significant insight. Building on this, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on? We could explore your progress with thought records, discuss any challenges you've encountered, or work on developing additional coping strategies.\n\nPatient: I think it would be helpful to review my thought records and discuss any challenges I've faced with the reframing techniques. I'm also interested in exploring additional coping strategies for managing my sleep disturbances and feelings of worthlessness. What do you think?\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan for today's session. We can start by reviewing your thought records and discussing any challenges you've encountered with reframing. Then, we can explore additional coping strategies for managing sleep disturbances and feelings of worthlessness. As we work through these topics, we'll continue to practice cognitive restructuring and distress tolerance techniques. How does that sound?",
