  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in managing your depressive symptoms and building resilience. You've been consistently practicing the techniques we've discussed, such as reframing negative thoughts, self-compassion, and engaging in enjoyable activities. These skills take time to develop, so be patient with yourself as you continue to practice them.\n\nIn our next session, we'll focus on stress management techniques and explore ways to cope with work-related pressure. We'll discuss setting boundaries, practicing relaxation techniques, challenging perfectionistic thoughts, and incorporating more self-care into your daily routine.\n\nFor homework, I'd like you to continue keeping thought records, focusing on reframing negative thoughts related to worthlessness and lack of motivation. Aim to complete at least one thought record per day and bring them to our next session for review. Additionally, practice the self-compassion break technique whenever feelings of worthlessness arise. Acknowledge your feelings without judgment, remind yourself that everyone struggles with these feelings at times, and offer yourself words of kindness and understanding.\n\nContinue attending your art classes and practicing Spanish to enhance social connections and improve your mood. Set a goal to have a conversation with a classmate, perhaps arriving early to allow time for connection. Also, follow up with your old friend and try to schedule a time to meet for coffee or a phone call.\n\nRemember, progress takes time, and it's okay to take small steps. Be kind to yourself as you navigate these challenges, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when needed.\n\nBefore we end today's session, I want to check in on your current mood and see if you have any final thoughts or questions.\n\nPatient: Thank you for your support and guidance, Nova. I feel encouraged by the progress I've made so far, and I'm looking forward to continuing our work together. I know that managing depression is an ongoing process, but I feel more equipped to handle the challenges that come my way.\n\nMy current mood is stable, and I feel a sense of hope and motivation after our session today. I don't have any final questions, but I appreciate you checking in.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling encouraged and motivated, Priya. Remember that you have the skills and resources to manage your depressive symptoms, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. If any questions or concerns arise between now and our next session, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nTake care, and I look forward to seeing you at our next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Priya's thought records and discussed insights and challenges encountered with reframing negative thoughts related to worthlessness and lack of motivation\n  - Checked in on progress with self-compassion, behavioral activation goals, and social connection efforts\n  - Discussed stress management techniques and coping with work-related pressure\n  - Explored setting boundaries, practicing relaxation techniques, challenging perfectionistic thoughts, and incorporating self-care into daily routine\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (continued from previous sessions): Priya will continue using thought records, focusing on reframing negative thoughts related to worthlessness and lack of motivation.
