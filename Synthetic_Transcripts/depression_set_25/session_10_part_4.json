  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you sharing the courtroom analogy and the self-compassion break technique. I can see how these tools can help me challenge my negative thoughts and be kinder to myself. It's going to take practice, but I'm willing to put in the effort.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find these techniques helpful, Priya. Remember, practice is key when it comes to reframing thoughts and developing self-compassion. It's normal to face challenges along the way, but with persistence, it will become easier over time.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, let's discuss some homework assignments to help you continue practicing these skills. First, I'd like you to keep using the thought records, focusing on the courtroom analogy when you're struggling to reframe negative thoughts. Aim to complete at least one thought record per day, and bring them to our next session so we can review them together.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll make sure to use the thought records and the courtroom analogy daily.\n\nTherapist: Great! Additionally, I'd like you to practice the self-compassion break technique whenever you notice feelings of worthlessness arising. Take a moment to acknowledge your feelings without judgment, remind yourself that everyone struggles with these feelings at times, and offer yourself some words of kindness and understanding.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely try the self-compassion break technique. It's a good reminder to be kind to myself, even when I'm struggling.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. Self-compassion is a powerful tool for managing difficult emotions. Lastly, continue practicing the stimulus control technique to improve your sleep. Remember to only use your bed for sleep and intimacy, and if you can't fall asleep within 20-30 minutes, get up and do a calming activity until you feel sleepy.\n\nPatient: I'll keep working on the stimulus control technique. I know it might take some time to see improvements in my sleep, but I'm committed to making these changes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Priya. Change takes time, but with consistent effort, you will start to notice improvements in your sleep and overall well-being.\n\nBefore we end today's session, I want to check in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful after discussing these new techniques. I know I still have work to do, but I feel like I have some additional tools to help me manage my negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness. Thank you for your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Priya. I'm glad you're feeling more hopeful, and I'm confident that with continued practice, you'll make progress in managing your negative thoughts and improving your overall well-being. Remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed thought records and challenges with reframing guilty thoughts related to self-care and setting boundaries\n  - Introduced and practiced the courtroom analogy for reframing negative thoughts\n  - Discussed additional coping strategies for managing sleep disturbances (stimulus control) and feelings of worthlessness (self-compassion break)\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (continued from previous sessions): Priya will continue using thought records, focusing on the courtroom analogy when struggling to reframe negative thoughts.
