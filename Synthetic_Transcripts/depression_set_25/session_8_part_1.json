  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 8. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like keeping thought records and practicing self-care activities. It's been challenging at times, but I do notice some improvements in my mood and overall well-being. However, I still struggle with feelings of guilt when prioritizing self-care and anxiety around social interactions.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we've discussed and that you've noticed some improvements in your mood and well-being. It's also important to acknowledge the challenges you're still facing, such as feelings of guilt around self-care and anxiety in social interactions. We can definitely explore these challenges further in today's session. Before we do that, let's take a moment to set an agenda for our time together. What would you like to prioritize in our session today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on strategies for managing the guilt I feel when prioritizing self-care and ways to cope with anxiety in social situations. I also want to discuss how I can continue to challenge my negative thoughts and build upon the progress I've made so far.\n\nTherapist: Those are great topics to focus on in our session today. Let's start by exploring the guilt you experience when prioritizing self-care. Can you tell me more about the thoughts and feelings that come up for you in those moments?",
