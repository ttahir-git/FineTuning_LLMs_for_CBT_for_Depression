  "transcript": "Patient: Another situation where I might feel guilty is when I'm invited to social events, but I'm not feeling up to it. I might think, \"I should go because they invited me, and it's rude to decline.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's apply the reframing technique to this situation. What would be a more balanced and adaptive way to view declining a social invitation?\n\nPatient: I could tell myself that it's okay to prioritize my own needs and well-being. If I'm not in the right headspace for socializing, it's better to decline than to force myself to go and end up feeling worse. I can express my gratitude for the invitation and suggest an alternative time to get together when I'm feeling more up to it.\n\nTherapist: Excellent reframing! By recognizing that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being, you can start to challenge those guilty thoughts when they arise. It's not about being rude; it's about being honest with yourself and others about your current state and what you need in that moment.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. It's just hard to break out of that people-pleasing mindset sometimes.\n\nTherapist: I understand. It's common to struggle with people-pleasing tendencies, especially if you've been conditioned to prioritize others' needs over your own. That's why it's so important to practice reframing those thoughts consistently. Over time, it will become easier to challenge them in the moment and prioritize your own well-being without feeling guilty.\n\nAs we wrap up our session today, I want to check in on how you're feeling. What are your main takeaways from our discussion?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more empowered to challenge those guilty thoughts related to self-care and setting boundaries. It's helpful to have these reframing techniques to fall back on when those thoughts arise. I know it will take practice, but I feel more equipped to prioritize my own well-being without feeling as guilty.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more empowered and equipped to challenge those guilty thoughts. Remember, it's a skill that develops with practice, so be patient with yourself as you continue to work on reframing those thoughts.\n\nFor homework, I'd like you to continue keeping thought records, focusing on identifying and challenging guilty thoughts related to self-care and setting boundaries. Aim to record at least one or two thoughts per day, along with the situation, emotions, and reframed thought. Also, practice using the reframing techniques we discussed today when guilty thoughts arise, whether it's related to taking a mental health day, declining a social invitation, or any other situation where you might feel guilty for prioritizing your own needs.\n\nIn our next session, we'll review your thought records and discuss any insights or challenges you encountered with the reframing techniques. We'll also continue to explore the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and work on developing additional coping strategies for managing depressive symptoms.\n\nBefore we end, do you have any final thoughts or questions?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for your support and guidance today.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. Take care, and I look forward to our next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Reframing guilty thoughts related to self-care and setting boundaries, people-pleasing tendencies, and the importance of prioritizing one's own well-being.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (continued from previous sessions): Priya has been keeping thought records and practicing identifying and challenging cognitive distortions.
