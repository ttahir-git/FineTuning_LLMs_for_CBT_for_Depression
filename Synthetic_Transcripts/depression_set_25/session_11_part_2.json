  "transcript": "Patient: One challenge I've faced with the thought records is that sometimes I struggle to identify the evidence against my negative thoughts. When I'm feeling really low, it's hard to see things objectively and come up with alternative perspectives.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Priya. It can be challenging to identify evidence against negative thoughts, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed by emotions. One technique that can be helpful is to imagine that you're a detective or a lawyer building a case. Try to approach the situation as if you're an outsider looking in, rather than being caught up in the emotions of the moment. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think so. It's like trying to step outside of myself and look at the situation more objectively.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Another helpful strategy is to consider what you might say to a friend or loved one who was in a similar situation. We often have an easier time being compassionate and understanding with others than we do with ourselves. Can you think of a time when you offered support or encouragement to someone else who was struggling with negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. My friend was really upset the other day because she made a mistake at work and felt like she was going to be fired. I reminded her of all the great work she's done in the past and that everyone makes mistakes sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example! You were able to see the situation objectively and offer a more balanced perspective. The next time you're struggling with negative thoughts about yourself, try to apply that same kindness and understanding. What might you say to yourself in that situation?\n\nPatient: I guess I would remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that one misstep doesn't define my entire worth or career.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! That's a great way to reframe those negative thoughts. Another strategy is to look for evidence that contradicts your negative beliefs. For example, if you're thinking \"I'm a failure,\" you could look for times when you've succeeded or accomplished something, even if it feels small. Can you think of any examples like that?\n\nPatient: Well, I recently completed a big project at work that got positive feedback from my boss. And I've been making progress with my art classes, even though it's challenging at times.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples! It's important to acknowledge and celebrate those successes, even if they feel small. Every step forward counts. Another helpful technique is to consider the long-term consequences of your negative thoughts. Ask yourself, \"If I continue to think this way, where will it lead me?\" Often, negative thoughts can hold us back and prevent us from taking risks or trying new things. Can you relate to that at all?\n\nPatient: Definitely. Sometimes I get so caught up in negative thoughts that I don't even want to try new things because I'm afraid of failing.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience. The good news is that by practicing these reframing techniques, you can start to break out of that cycle and build more confidence in yourself. It takes time and practice, but it's definitely possible. What do you think about trying some of these strategies this week and seeing how it goes?",
