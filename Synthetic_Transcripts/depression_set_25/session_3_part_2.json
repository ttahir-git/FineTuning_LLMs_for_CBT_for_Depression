  "transcript": "Patient: One pattern I noticed in my thought records is that I often engage in all-or-nothing thinking, especially when it comes to my work performance. I tend to see things as either perfect or a complete failure, with no in-between.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Priya. All-or-nothing thinking is a common cognitive distortion that can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety. By recognizing this pattern, you can start to challenge these thoughts and find more balanced perspectives.\n\nAnother technique we can use to address cognitive distortions is called \"examining the evidence.\" This involves looking at the facts that support or refute your negative thoughts. For example, if you think, \"I'm a failure at work,\" we would explore the evidence for and against this thought. What are some pieces of evidence that contradict this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I have received positive feedback and promotions throughout my career. I've also successfully completed many projects and have a strong work ethic. These points would contradict the thought that I'm a failure at work.\n\nTherapist: Excellent! You've identified several pieces of evidence that challenge the negative thought. This is a powerful way to reframe your thinking and reduce the impact of cognitive distortions.\n\nNow, let's discuss your goals for therapy. Last session, we talked about some general areas you'd like to work on, such as managing depressive symptoms, improving work-life balance, and enhancing social connections. Let's break these down into specific, measurable goals. What would you like to achieve in each of these areas?\n\nPatient: For managing depressive symptoms, I'd like to reduce the frequency and intensity of my negative thoughts and emotions. Maybe I could aim to have at least three days per week where I feel more positive than negative.\n\nFor work-life balance, I'd like to set boundaries around my work hours and dedicate more time to self-care and hobbies. I could aim to leave work by 6 pm at least three days per week and engage in a hobby or relaxation activity for at least 30 minutes each day.\n\nRegarding social connections, I'd like to reach out to friends or family members at least once per week and attend a social event or gathering at least once per month.\n\nTherapist: These are great, specific goals, Priya! They are realistic and measurable, which will help us track your progress throughout therapy. We can revisit these goals regularly and adjust them as needed.\n\nNow, I'd like to introduce a simple CBT technique that we can practice today and use in future sessions. It's called \"behavioral activation.\" This involves intentionally engaging in activities that promote positive emotions, a sense of accomplishment, or social connection, even when you don't feel motivated to do so.\n\nFor example, you mentioned enjoying painting and drawing. Behavioral activation might involve setting aside 30 minutes to paint, even if you don't feel particularly inspired or motivated. The act of engaging in the activity can help boost your mood and energy levels.\n\nWhat are some activities you could incorporate into your routine as part of behavioral activation?\n\nPatient: I could set aside time for painting or drawing, as you mentioned. I could also make a habit of going for a short walk outside each day, as being in nature tends to lift my spirits. Another idea is to schedule regular phone or video calls with my close friends or family members to maintain social connections.\n\nTherapist: Those are all excellent ideas for behavioral activation! The key is to start small and build up gradually. Choose activities that are manageable and likely to bring you a sense of enjoyment, accomplishment, or connection.\n\nLet's practice a simple behavioral activation exercise now. Take a moment to think of one small, enjoyable activity you could do today, after our session. It could be something as simple as taking a 10-minute walk, listening to a favorite song, or doing a quick sketch. What activity comes to mind for you?",
