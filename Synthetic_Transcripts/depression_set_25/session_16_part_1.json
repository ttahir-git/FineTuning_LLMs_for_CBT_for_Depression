  "transcript": "Therapist: Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session, Priya. It's great to see that we've been making progress in challenging negative thoughts and beliefs related to perfectionism, self-worth, and relationships. Before we dive into today's session, I want to acknowledge some limitations as your AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say, so please don't hesitate to correct me if I get something wrong. Lastly, I want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency service.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm looking forward to continuing our work together.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Priya. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have you noticed any changes in your mood or stress levels?\n\nPatient: Overall, I've been feeling a bit better. I've been trying to practice the scheduled relaxation and self-care activities we discussed, like painting. It's been helpful in managing my stress, but I still find myself struggling with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness at times.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing self-care and finding it helpful in managing stress. It's also normal to still experience negative thoughts and feelings, even as you make progress. Can you share an example of a situation where you found yourself struggling with negative thoughts since our last session?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I made a mistake at work, and I found myself spiraling into negative thoughts about being incompetent and not good enough. Even though my colleagues reassured me that it wasn't a big deal, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had let everyone down.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Priya. It's a great opportunity for us to explore how we can use the skills we've been working on to challenge those negative thoughts. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on continuing to challenge negative thoughts and beliefs, especially related to perfectionism and self-worth. I also want to discuss how I can better manage stress and prevent myself from spiraling into negative thoughts when I make mistakes or face challenges.\n\nTherapist: Those are great priorities, Priya. Let's start by reviewing some of the thought records you've been keeping since our last session. Can you share an example of a thought record where you challenged negative thoughts related to perfectionism or self-worth?",
