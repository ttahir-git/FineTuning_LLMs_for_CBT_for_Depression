  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in on how you've been doing since our last session. How has your mood been? Have you noticed any changes or challenges?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like setting smaller goals for self-care and challenging negative thoughts. It's still a challenge, but I think I'm making some progress. My mood has been relatively stable, although I still have moments where I feel overwhelmed or down.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed and noticing some progress. It's normal to still experience challenges and moments of feeling overwhelmed or down. Recovery is a process, and it takes time. Let's explore your experiences with setting smaller self-care goals and challenging negative thoughts. What have you noticed when you practice these techniques?\n\nPatient: When I set smaller goals for self-care, like painting for just 10-15 minutes instead of an hour, I find it more manageable. I'm more likely to actually do it, and it does help me feel a bit better. But sometimes I still struggle with motivation, and I feel guilty for not doing more.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Priya. Setting smaller, more achievable goals can make self-care feel less overwhelming and increase the likelihood of following through. It's also important to recognize and challenge the guilt that comes up when you feel like you're not doing enough. Remember, self-care is about nurturing yourself, not about meeting some unrealistic standard of productivity. Every small step counts.\n\nRegarding challenging negative thoughts, what has that process been like for you? Have you been using the thought records we discussed?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to use the thought records, but it's still challenging. Sometimes I get stuck in the negative thought patterns and struggle to find evidence against them. And even when I do challenge the thoughts, the emotions sometimes linger.\n\nTherapist: Challenging negative thoughts can be difficult, especially when the emotions are intense. It's a skill that takes practice. When you find yourself stuck, try to approach the situation with curiosity and self-compassion. Ask yourself, \"Is this thought based on facts or feelings?\" and \"What would I say to a friend in this situation?\"\n\nRemember, the goal isn't to eliminate negative emotions completely, but to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective. Emotions take time to shift, even as we challenge the thoughts behind them.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I'll try to be more patient with myself and keep practicing.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Priya. Let's set an agenda for today's session. We can review your thought records in more detail, discuss your progress with self-care and boundary-setting, and explore any challenges that have come up. We can also continue working on challenging your core belief about perfectionism and deserving love and respect. Does that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds good, Nova. I think it would also be helpful to discuss strategies for managing stress at work. Even with the boundary-setting, I still find myself feeling overwhelmed and stressed quite often.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, let's definitely discuss stress management strategies for work. We can explore some specific techniques, like deep breathing exercises or mindfulness practices, that you can use in the moment when you start to feel overwhelmed. We can also look at some bigger picture strategies, like time management and prioritization, to help reduce overall stress levels.\n\nLet's start by reviewing your thought records. Can you share an example of a negative thought you've challenged recently?",
