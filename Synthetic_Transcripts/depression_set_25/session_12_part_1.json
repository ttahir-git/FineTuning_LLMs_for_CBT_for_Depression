  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like reframing negative thoughts and self-compassion. It's been challenging at times, but I think I'm making some progress. I've also been attending my art classes and practicing Spanish, which has helped me feel a bit more connected to others.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed and engaging in activities that promote social connection. I'm glad to know that you're seeing some progress, even if it feels challenging at times. Can you share more about your experience with reframing negative thoughts and practicing self-compassion? How has it been for you?\n\nPatient: Reframing negative thoughts has been an interesting process. I've noticed that I often have automatic thoughts that contribute to feelings of worthlessness and lack of motivation. By using the thought records, I've been able to identify these thoughts and challenge them by looking at the evidence for and against them. It's not always easy, but it does help me see things from a different perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Priya. Recognizing those automatic thoughts and challenging them is a crucial step in managing depressive symptoms. It's wonderful that you're able to see things from a different perspective, even if it's not always easy. How about self-compassion? How has that practice been for you?\n\nPatient: Self-compassion is a bit more challenging for me. I've always been hard on myself, so offering myself kindness and understanding feels a bit foreign. However, I've been trying to practice it, especially when I notice feelings of worthlessness arising. I remind myself that everyone struggles with these feelings at times and that it's okay to be kind to myself.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that self-compassion can feel foreign, especially if you're used to being hard on yourself. It's great that you're making an effort to practice it, even if it feels challenging. Remember that self-compassion is a skill that takes time to develop, so be patient with yourself as you continue to practice.\n\nNow, let's set an agenda for today's session. Based on what you've shared, I think it would be helpful to review your thought records and discuss any insights or challenges you've encountered with reframing negative thoughts related to worthlessness and lack of motivation. We can also check in on your progress with self-compassion, behavioral activation goals, and social connection efforts. What do you think about that? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?",
