  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 15. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in on how you've been doing since our last session. How have you been feeling, and have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like scheduled relaxation and the double standard technique. I've noticed some improvement in my mood, but I still struggle with perfectionism and negative self-talk at times. Work has been particularly stressful lately, which makes it challenging to prioritize self-care.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we discussed, and that you've noticed some improvement in your mood. It's understandable that stress at work can make it difficult to prioritize self-care. Let's explore that further today.\n\nFor our agenda, I'd like to suggest the following:\n1. Review your thought records and discuss any insights or challenges related to challenging perfectionism and setting realistic goals.\n2. Check in on your progress with self-care activities, like painting, and discuss any changes in mood or stress levels.\n3. Explore your experiences with scheduled relaxation and the double standard technique, addressing any challenges or successes.\n4. Discuss any adjustments needed to the treatment plan based on your experiences and progress.\n5. Begin exploring underlying beliefs that may contribute to perfectionism and negative self-talk, working on reframing these beliefs in a more balanced and compassionate way.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
