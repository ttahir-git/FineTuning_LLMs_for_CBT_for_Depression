  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great insights today, Priya. I'm impressed by your willingness to challenge perfectionism and prioritize self-care, even when it feels difficult. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. The important thing is that you're taking steps in the right direction and developing new habits to support your mental health and well-being.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I know it won't be easy, but I'm committed to making these changes. I appreciate your guidance and support throughout this process.\n\nTherapist: Before we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on your current mood and see if you have any final thoughts or questions.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, but also hopeful. It's comforting to know that I have strategies to work on and that I'm not alone in this journey. I don't have any specific questions right now, but I'm sure I'll think of some as I continue to practice these techniques.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed at times, especially when you're challenging long-held beliefs and patterns. Remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when needed.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue working on your thought records, focusing on challenging perfectionism and looking for evidence that contradicts your negative thoughts. Aim to complete at least one thought record per day and bring them to our next session for review.\n\nI also encourage you to practice scheduled relaxation by setting aside dedicated time for painting or other self-care activities. Try to communicate your boundaries with colleagues and remind yourself that taking time for yourself is essential for your well-being.\n\nFinally, continue practicing the \"double standard\" technique whenever you catch yourself being overly critical or setting unrealistic standards for yourself. Remind yourself that you deserve the same compassion and understanding you would offer to a friend.\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I'll do my best to complete the thought records and practice scheduled relaxation and the \"double standard\" technique. Thank you for your support and guidance, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Priya. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, progress takes time, and every small step counts. I'm proud of the work you're doing, and I'm confident that with continued practice, you'll start to notice positive changes in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\n\nLet's plan to meet again next week to review your thought records and discuss your experiences with the techniques we've covered today.
