  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like the courtroom analogy and self-compassion break. It's been challenging at times, but I think I'm making some progress. My sleep has improved a bit with the stimulus control technique, but I still struggle with feelings of worthlessness and lack of motivation.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements in your sleep. It's common to face challenges when working on reframing negative thoughts and practicing self-compassion. We can definitely explore those feelings of worthlessness and lack of motivation further today. Before we dive in, can you share a bit more about how your mood has been overall since our last session?\n\nPatient: My mood has been up and down. Some days I feel more hopeful and motivated, especially when I engage in activities like painting or attending my art class. But there are still days when I struggle to get out of bed and feel overwhelmed by negative thoughts. I've also been feeling a bit lonely and disconnected from my friends and community.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to have ups and downs, and it's good that you're noticing the activities that help improve your mood. The feelings of loneliness and disconnection are important to address too. Let's make sure to include that in our agenda for today. Speaking of which, what would you like to prioritize in our session today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on managing the feelings of worthlessness and exploring ways to connect more with others. I also want to discuss some challenges I've faced with the thought records and reframing techniques.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. We can start by discussing the challenges you've encountered with the thought records and reframing techniques, then explore the feelings of worthlessness and strategies for connecting with others. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's begin with the thought records and reframing techniques. Can you share some of the challenges you've faced while using these tools?",
