  "transcript": "Therapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions about ending therapy, Priya. On one hand, you've made significant progress and have developed a strong set of skills to support your well-being. On the other hand, it's natural to feel apprehensive about navigating challenges without the regular support of our sessions. Let's explore these feelings a bit more. What specific concerns do you have about managing your mental health after our sessions end?\n\nPatient: I think my main concern is not having this dedicated space to process my thoughts and emotions. I worry that without this regular check-in, I might start to neglect my mental health and fall back into old patterns.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, Priya. It's important to remember that the skills and strategies you've learned in therapy are always with you, even if our sessions are ending. One way to address this concern is to create a plan for how you'll continue to prioritize your mental health going forward. This might include setting aside regular time for self-reflection, journaling, or engaging in self-care activities. It could also involve reaching out to trusted friends or family members for support when needed. What do you think about creating a plan like this for yourself?",
