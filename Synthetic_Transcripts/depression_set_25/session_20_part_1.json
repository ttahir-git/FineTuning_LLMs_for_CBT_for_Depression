  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last session. It's been a remarkable journey witnessing your progress and growth throughout our time together. How have you been feeling since our last meeting? I'm curious to know if you've noticed any changes in your mood or if you've had any significant experiences you'd like to share.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing relatively well. I've been trying to implement the coping strategies from my toolbox, especially when I notice early warning signs of depression creeping in. It's not always easy, but I'm proud of myself for making a conscious effort.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Priya. Recognizing your own efforts and progress is a crucial part of maintaining your well-being. Can you share an example of a time when you successfully used one of the tools from your coping strategies toolbox?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just last week, I started feeling overwhelmed with work and noticed myself slipping into negative thought patterns. I caught myself and decided to take a break to practice some deep breathing exercises and go for a walk in nature. It helped me reset and approach my work with a clearer mind.\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic example of putting your coping strategies into action, Priya. You recognized the early warning signs and proactively used your mindfulness techniques and self-care activities to manage your emotions. This demonstrates your growing ability to be your own therapist, which is a key goal of CBT.\n\nNow, let's take a moment to set our agenda for today's session. We have a few important topics to cover, given that this is our final scheduled session. I'd like to review your toolbox of coping strategies, discuss your wellness action plan, and explore your feelings about ending therapy. We can also discuss any other concerns or questions you may have. What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: I think reviewing my toolbox and wellness action plan is important, as I want to make sure I have a solid plan in place for managing my well-being after our sessions end. I'm also feeling a bit anxious about ending therapy, so I'd like to discuss that as well.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Priya. Those are all important topics to cover. Let's start by reviewing your toolbox of coping strategies. Can you walk me through the tools and techniques you've included and how you've been using them recently?",
