  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned earlier that you've been trying to implement self-care activities and boundary-setting techniques, but you've found it challenging with your work schedule. Let's explore this further. Can you share an example of a self-care activity you've tried to incorporate and what got in the way?\n\nPatient: One self-care activity I've been trying to do is painting in the evenings after work. However, I often find myself too exhausted to paint, or I get caught up in worrying about work tasks for the next day.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle. The situation is that you plan to paint after work, but you feel too exhausted or preoccupied with work thoughts. The thoughts might be something like, \"I'm too tired to paint\" or \"I should be preparing for work tomorrow instead.\" These thoughts then lead to feelings of exhaustion or anxiety, which result in the behavior of skipping the painting activity. Does this sound accurate?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's exactly what happens. I get stuck in those thoughts and feelings, and I end up not doing the self-care activity I had planned.\n\nTherapist: This is a common challenge, and it's something we can work on using CBT techniques. One strategy is to challenge those thoughts that are getting in the way of your self-care. For example, you could ask yourself, \"Is it true that I'm too tired to paint? Or could I start with just a few minutes of painting and see how it feels?\" or \"Do I really need to prepare for work right now, or can it wait until tomorrow?\"\n\nPatient: I can see how challenging those thoughts could be helpful. It's just hard to do that in the moment when I'm feeling so exhausted or anxious.\n\nTherapist: That's understandable. Another strategy is to set smaller, more manageable goals for your self-care activities. Instead of planning to paint for an hour, you could start with just 10 or 15 minutes. This can feel less overwhelming and more achievable, even when you're tired or preoccupied with work thoughts.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I think setting smaller goals could help me actually follow through with the self-care activities.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And as you start to engage in these activities more regularly, you may find that they actually help reduce your exhaustion and anxiety levels. Self-care can be a powerful tool for managing stress and improving overall well-being.\n\nPatient: I can see how that could be true. I just need to work on prioritizing it and challenging those thoughts that get in the way.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Priya. Remember, self-care is not selfish. It's an essential part of maintaining your mental health and well-being. As we continue to work on challenging negative thoughts and setting boundaries, I think you'll find it easier to prioritize self-care activities.\n\nPatient: I hope so. I know I need to make changes, but it's just hard to break old habits and patterns.\n\nTherapist: Change is definitely challenging, but you've already taken some important steps in the right direction. Every small change you make is a step towards a more balanced and fulfilling life. Let's continue to work on building these skills together.",
