  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great insights today, Priya. I'm impressed by your willingness to challenge negative thoughts and prioritize self-care, even when it's difficult. Remember, change is a process, and every small step counts.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your support and encouragement. It's helpful to have a safe space to process these challenges and develop new skills.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're finding our sessions helpful. As we wrap up today, I'd like to assign some homework to help you continue practicing these skills. First, I'd like you to set aside 10 minutes each day to review your thoughts and complete a thought record, focusing on challenging negative thoughts related to work and self-care. Second, I'd like you to schedule at least one self-care activity each day, even if it's just for a few minutes. Finally, I'd like you to practice setting a small boundary at work, such as leaving on time or taking a break when needed. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds manageable. I'll do my best to complete the homework and practice these skills.\n\nTherapist: Great. Remember, the goal is progress, not perfection. Every small step counts, and I'm here to support you along the way.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that reminder. I'll do my best to be kind to myself and celebrate the small victories.\n\nTherapist: That's a great attitude, Priya. Before we end today, I'd like to do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now, and do you have any final thoughts or questions?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful and empowered after our session. I know I have some work to do, but I feel more equipped to handle the challenges. No final questions, but thank you for your support and guidance.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Priya. I'm glad you're feeling more hopeful and empowered. Remember, you have the skills and strength to navigate these challenges, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and I look forward to our next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Priya's thought records and experiences with challenging negative thoughts and beliefs related to work and self-care.\n  - Explored challenges with prioritizing self-care activities and setting boundaries at work.\n  - Discussed strategies for challenging negative thoughts and setting smaller, more manageable goals for self-care.\n  - Checked in on Priya's current mood and progress with managing depressive symptoms.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (continued from previous sessions): Priya will continue using thought records to challenge negative thoughts related to work and self-care.
