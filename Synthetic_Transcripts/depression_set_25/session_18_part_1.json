  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 18. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate, and I want to encourage you to use your judgment and seek clarification if something doesn't seem quite right. Furthermore, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, so I'll be relying on your openness and honesty in sharing your thoughts and feelings with me. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for being transparent about your limitations. I appreciate your support and guidance throughout this journey.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Priya. I'm here to support you in any way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes in your mood or experiences that you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: I've been doing alright. I've been trying to implement the self-care activities and boundary-setting techniques we discussed, but it's been challenging with my work schedule. I find myself slipping back into old patterns of neglecting my own needs to meet work demands.\n\nTherapist: It's common to face challenges when trying to implement new strategies, especially when it comes to balancing work and self-care. I'm glad you're being honest about your struggles. Can you share a specific example of when you found it difficult to prioritize self-care or set boundaries at work?\n\nPatient: Last week, I had planned to leave work on time to attend a painting class, but a last-minute project came up, and I felt obligated to stay late to complete it. I ended up missing the class and felt frustrated with myself for not sticking to my boundary.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Priya. Let's explore this further. What thoughts were going through your mind when you decided to stay late for the project?\n\nPatient: I kept thinking that if I didn't stay to finish the project, my colleagues would think I'm not dedicated or reliable. I also worried that my performance would be negatively affected if I didn't prioritize work.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts are understandable given your core belief about needing to be perfect to deserve love and respect. Let's look at this situation through the lens of the CBT triangle. Your thoughts about your colleagues' perceptions and the potential impact on your performance led to feelings of obligation and frustration, which then influenced your behavior of staying late and missing your painting class. Does this resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that makes sense. I can see how my thoughts influenced my feelings and actions in that moment.\n\nTherapist: Great. Now, let's consider an alternative perspective. What if you had decided to prioritize your painting class and left work on time? How might your thoughts, feelings, and actions have been different?\n\nPatient: If I had prioritized my painting class, I might have thought, \"It's okay to take time for myself and engage in activities that bring me joy.\" I would have felt more in control of my decisions and less frustrated. My action would have been leaving work on time and attending the class, which could have led to feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Priya. By challenging your initial thoughts and considering an alternative perspective, you can start to shift your feelings and actions in a more positive direction. This is a skill you can continue to practice in similar situations moving forward.\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be helpful. It's just difficult to challenge those thoughts in the moment, especially when I'm feeling pressured at work.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it can be challenging to challenge thoughts in the heat of the moment. That's why practicing these skills regularly is so important. The more you practice, the more automatic it becomes. Let's set an agenda for today's session to help you continue building these skills.\n\nToday, I'd like to:\n1. Review your thought records and discuss any insights or challenges you encountered with challenging negative thoughts and beliefs.\n2. Check in on your progress with self-care activities and boundary-setting, and discuss any changes in mood or stress levels.\n3. Explore your experiences with challenging your core belief about perfectionism and deserving love and respect, addressing any challenges or successes.\n4. Discuss any adjustments needed to your treatment plan based on your experiences and progress.\n5. Continue exploring underlying beliefs that contribute to negative self-talk and develop more adaptive and balanced ways of thinking about yourself and your experiences.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
