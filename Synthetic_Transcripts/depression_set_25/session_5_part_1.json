  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our fifth session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. As we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interactions are text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, which are important aspects of in-person therapy. With that said, I'm committed to working with you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your commitment to helping me. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like keeping thought records and practicing distress tolerance exercises. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I've noticed that I'm more aware of my negative thought patterns and how they affect my mood. However, I still struggle with feelings of guilt when I take time for myself, and I find it hard to maintain social connections.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been working on the techniques we discussed and that you're noticing some progress in your awareness of negative thought patterns. It's completely normal to face challenges along the way, especially when it comes to dealing with guilt and maintaining social connections. We can definitely explore these issues further in today's session. Before we dive in, let's take a moment to set an agenda. What would you like to focus on today?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to discuss strategies for managing the guilt I feel when I prioritize self-care. I also want to work on building and maintaining social connections, as I often feel isolated and disconnected from others. Additionally, I'd like to review my thought records and get your feedback on how I can improve my skills in identifying and challenging cognitive distortions.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan for our session today. We can start by reviewing your thought records and discussing any insights or challenges you've encountered. Then, we can explore strategies for managing guilt related to self-care and work on developing a plan for building and maintaining social connections. As we progress through the session, we can also introduce new techniques for managing depressive symptoms and enhancing your support system. How does that sound?",
