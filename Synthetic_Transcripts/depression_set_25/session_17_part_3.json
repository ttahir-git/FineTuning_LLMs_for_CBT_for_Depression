  "transcript": "Therapist: Absolutely, let's discuss some practical strategies for scheduling self-care and setting boundaries. One approach is to start small and build up gradually. For example, you could begin by setting aside just 15 minutes a day for a self-care activity, like painting or deep breathing exercises. Once you're consistently making time for that, you can gradually increase the duration or frequency.\n\nWhen it comes to setting boundaries, it can be helpful to start by identifying your needs and priorities. What are the things that are most important for your mental health and well-being? Once you've identified those, you can practice communicating them to others in a clear and assertive way.\n\nFor example, if you need to leave work on time in order to prioritize self-care, you might say something like, \"I've noticed that I've been staying late at work a lot lately, and it's starting to take a toll on my mental health. I'm going to make an effort to leave on time from now on, so that I can prioritize some self-care activities. I appreciate your understanding.\"\n\nHow does that sound? Do you think you could try implementing some of these strategies in the coming week?\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of starting small with self-care and building up gradually. And I can see how identifying my needs and priorities could help with setting boundaries. I'm a little nervous about actually communicating those boundaries to others, especially at work. I worry that people will think I'm not pulling my weight or that I'm not committed to my job.\n\nTherapist: It's completely understandable to feel nervous about setting boundaries, especially in a work context. It's common to worry about how others will perceive us or whether we're doing enough. However, it's important to remember that taking care of your mental health is just as important as meeting your work responsibilities. In fact, prioritizing self-care can actually help you be more productive and effective at work in the long run.\n\nOne way to address your concerns about how others will perceive you is to frame your boundary-setting in a positive way. Instead of focusing on what you're not doing (e.g., staying late), emphasize what you are doing (e.g., prioritizing self-care in order to be more effective at work).\n\nYou can also remind yourself that setting boundaries is a sign of self-respect and assertiveness, not selfishness or lack of commitment. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being, even if it means saying no to others sometimes.\n\nWhat do you think about that? Do you feel a little more comfortable with the idea of setting boundaries at work?\n\nPatient: That's a good point about framing it in a positive way. I can see how that could help me feel more confident in setting boundaries. And you're right, taking care of my mental health is important, and it doesn't mean I'm not committed to my job. I think I could try setting some small boundaries at work this week, like leaving on time at least a few days.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Priya. Setting small, achievable goals like that is a great way to start building your boundary-setting skills. Remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself as you practice these new strategies. It's okay if it feels uncomfortable or challenging at first \u2013 that's a normal part of the process.\n\nAs you work on setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care, it can also be helpful to challenge any negative thoughts or beliefs that come up. For example, if you notice yourself thinking, \"I'm being selfish by leaving work on time,\" you can use the skills we've been practicing to reframe that thought in a more balanced way.\n\nWhat might be a more balanced or helpful way to think about leaving work on time?",
