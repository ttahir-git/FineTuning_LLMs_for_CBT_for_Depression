  "transcript": "Therapist: You're doing a great job practicing these skills, Priya. Role-playing can be a really effective way to build confidence and prepare for real-life interactions. Remember, it's okay to take breaks or ask for help if you get stuck, and we can always pause to problem-solve or discuss any challenges that come up.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate the support and encouragement. It's helpful to have a safe space to practice these skills before trying them out in real social situations.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, that's what these sessions are for. I want to check in on how you're feeling now, after practicing the role-play and discussing your thoughts around self-care. How would you rate your anxiety and guilt now, on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: My anxiety is probably around 30 now, and my guilt is closer to 20. Talking through these situations and practicing the skills has helped me feel more prepared and less overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's great progress, Priya. It's normal to still feel some anxiety and guilt, but it's encouraging to see those numbers come down after practicing these techniques. Remember, the more you practice, the more natural and automatic these skills will become.\n\nPatient: I know it will take time and practice, but I feel more hopeful now that I have some tools to work with.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. Before we wrap up today's session, I'd like to assign some homework to help you continue practicing these skills between now and our next meeting. First, I'd like you to continue keeping thought records, focusing on situations where you feel guilty about self-care or anxious in social interactions. Try to identify the automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions, and practice generating alternative thoughts. Aim to complete at least one or two thought records per day.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can do that. I'll try to catch those thoughts and challenge them using the techniques we've practiced.\n\nTherapist: Great. I'd also like you to practice self-disclosure and active listening in at least one social interaction before our next session. Start small, like we discussed, and use your coping card to remind yourself of your skills and the benefits of connecting with others.\n\nPatient: That sounds manageable. I'll look for opportunities to practice those skills in conversations with coworkers or neighbors.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. And finally, I'd like you to schedule at least one self-care activity before our next session, whether that's painting, drawing, or something else you enjoy. Use your coping card to challenge any guilty thoughts that come up, and pay attention to how you feel during and after the activity.\n\nPatient: I can definitely do that. I'll put it on my calendar and make it a priority.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. Remember, self-care is an important part of managing depression and improving overall well-being. It's not selfish or lazy to take care of yourself.\n\nPatient: I'm starting to see that. Thank you for all your help and support today.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Priya. I'm proud of the progress you're making and the effort you're putting into these sessions and homework assignments. Remember, change takes time, but every small step counts. If you have any questions or concerns between now and our next session, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient: I will, thank you. I'm looking forward to our next session and continuing this work.\n\nTherapist: Me too. Take care, and I'll see you next time.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Managing guilt around self-care, coping with anxiety in social interactions, practicing self-disclosure and active listening, challenging negative thoughts using thought records.\n- Techniques or exercises used (with details on progress and plans for the future):\n  - Thought records (continued from previous sessions): Priya has been keeping thought records and practicing identifying and challenging cognitive distortions.
