  "transcript": "Here is part 2 of 4 for CBT session 14 with Priya:\n\nPatient: In my thought records, I noticed a recurring theme of feeling like I'm not doing enough or that my work isn't perfect. For example, last week I spent extra hours on a project to make sure it was flawless, but even after receiving positive feedback, I couldn't shake the feeling that it wasn't good enough.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Priya. It's a great observation that perfectionism is a common theme in your negative thoughts. This is something we can continue to work on together. When you find yourself thinking that your work isn't good enough, even after receiving positive feedback, what evidence do you have to support that thought?\n\nPatient: When I really think about it, I don't have much evidence to support the thought that my work isn't good enough. The feedback I receive is usually positive, and my colleagues seem satisfied with my contributions. But I still can't help but feel like I could have done better.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Priya. It's common for people who struggle with perfectionism to dismiss or minimize positive feedback and focus on perceived flaws or areas for improvement. This is a cognitive distortion called \"disqualifying the positive.\" One way to challenge this distortion is to actively look for evidence that contradicts your negative thoughts.\n\nFor example, you mentioned that the feedback you receive is usually positive. Can you think of a specific instance where you received praise or recognition for your work?\n\nPatient: Yes, just last month my manager commended me for my leadership on a successful project. She said my attention to detail and dedication were key factors in the project's success.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of evidence that contradicts your negative thoughts about not being good enough. When you find yourself falling into the perfectionism trap, try to remember instances like this where your hard work and abilities were recognized and appreciated.\n\nAnother technique we can use to challenge perfectionism is the \"double standard\" technique. This involves asking yourself if you would hold a friend or colleague to the same unrealistic standards you set for yourself. For example, if a friend came to you with the same accomplishments and positive feedback you've received, would you tell them that they weren't good enough?\n\nPatient: No, I wouldn't. I would congratulate them and tell them how proud I am of their hard work and success.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's important to practice extending the same compassion and understanding to yourself that you would offer to a friend. This is something we can continue to work on together.\n\nI also want to acknowledge that challenging perfectionism is a process, and it's okay if you don't always succeed in reframing your thoughts right away. The important thing is that you're becoming more aware of these patterns and actively working to change them.\n\nPatient: Thank you, that's a good reminder. I do find myself being much harder on myself than I would be on others. I'll try to practice being more compassionate and understanding towards myself.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Priya. Remember, self-compassion is a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself as you work on developing this new habit.\n\nLet's also discuss your progress with setting aside time for painting and other self-care activities. You mentioned that it's been challenging to prioritize these activities with your busy work schedule. Can you tell me more about the specific challenges you've encountered?",
