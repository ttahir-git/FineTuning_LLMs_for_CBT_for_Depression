  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our sixth session. Before we begin, I want to remind you that as an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your support. Since our last session, I've been trying to keep up with the thought records and self-care activities. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood. I still struggle with feelings of guilt when I prioritize self-care, but I'm working on practicing self-compassion.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been making an effort to maintain your thought records and engage in self-care activities. Small improvements in mood are a positive sign of progress. Regarding the feelings of guilt, it's understandable that they persist, as changing long-standing patterns of thinking takes time and practice. We can continue to work on self-compassion and explore other strategies to help you manage those feelings. How have you been doing with the distress tolerance techniques we discussed?\n\nPatient: The distress tolerance techniques have been helpful, especially deep breathing and grounding exercises. When I feel overwhelmed or stressed, I try to take a few moments to focus on my breath or engage my senses. It doesn't always make the feelings go away completely, but it helps me feel more centered and able to cope.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Priya. Using distress tolerance techniques to help you cope with overwhelming emotions is an important skill. Remember that the goal is not to eliminate the feelings entirely but to help you manage them more effectively. As we continue our work together, these techniques will become even more natural and automatic.\n\nNow, let's set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review your thought records and discuss any insights or challenges you've encountered. We can also check in on your progress with self-care planning and self-compassion. Additionally, I'd like to introduce some new techniques for managing depressive symptoms and enhancing social connections. What would you like to prioritize in our session today?\n\nPatient: I think reviewing the thought records and discussing my progress with self-care and self-compassion would be helpful. I'm also interested in learning new techniques for managing my depressive symptoms and improving my social connections. I've been feeling quite isolated lately, and I think that's been contributing to my low mood.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Priya. We'll start by reviewing your thought records and discussing your progress with self-care and self-compassion. Then, we can explore some new techniques for managing depressive symptoms and enhancing social connections, which will help address the isolation you've been experiencing. Let's begin with the thought records. Can you share some of the thoughts you've recorded since our last session?",
