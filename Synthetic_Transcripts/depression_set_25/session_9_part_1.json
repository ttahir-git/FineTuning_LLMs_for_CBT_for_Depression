  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for session 9. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed, like keeping thought records and practicing self-care activities. It's been challenging at times, but I've noticed some improvements in my mood and overall well-being. However, I still struggle with feelings of guilt when prioritizing self-care and anxiety in social situations.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on implementing the techniques we've discussed and that you've noticed some improvements in your mood and well-being. It's understandable that feelings of guilt and anxiety still arise in certain situations. We can continue to work on addressing these challenges. Before we set our agenda for today, can you share a bit more about your experiences with the homework assignments from our last session?\n\nPatient: Sure. I've been keeping thought records and trying to identify and challenge cognitive distortions related to self-care and social interactions. It's been helpful to see the connection between my thoughts and emotions more clearly. I also scheduled a self-care activity, which was attending an art class. It felt good to engage in a creative hobby, but I still had some guilty thoughts creep in. As for practicing self-disclosure and active listening, I had a conversation with a friend where I tried to open up a bit more about my feelings. It was uncomfortable at first, but it felt good to be more authentic in the interaction.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been consistent with keeping thought records and challenging cognitive distortions. Recognizing the connection between your thoughts and emotions is a crucial step in the process. I'm also happy to hear that you attended an art class as part of your self-care plan. It's normal for guilty thoughts to arise, but the fact that you followed through with the activity despite those thoughts is a significant accomplishment. Opening up to your friend and practicing self-disclosure and active listening is also a big step forward. These experiences, while uncomfortable at first, can help build more meaningful connections over time.\n\nFor today's agenda, I'd like to suggest the following:\n1. Review your thought records and discuss any insights or challenges you've encountered.\n2. Explore the feelings of guilt related to self-care in more depth and work on reframing those thoughts.\n3. Discuss your experience with self-disclosure and active listening, and brainstorm ways to continue building on those skills.\n4. Introduce the concept of cognitive and behavioral experiments to test out some of your beliefs in a more structured way.\n5. Check in on your progress with behavioral activation goals related to art classes and language learning.\n\nHow does this agenda sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?",
