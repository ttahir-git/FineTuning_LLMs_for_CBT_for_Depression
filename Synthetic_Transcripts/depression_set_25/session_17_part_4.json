  "transcript": "Patient: A more balanced way to think about leaving work on time might be, \"Leaving work on time allows me to prioritize my mental health and well-being, which actually makes me a more effective employee in the long run.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent reframe, Priya! By focusing on the long-term benefits of prioritizing your mental health, you can start to shift your perspective on setting boundaries at work. It's not about being selfish or uncommitted; it's about taking care of yourself so that you can show up as your best self in all areas of your life.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the great work you've been doing in challenging your negative thoughts and beliefs. It's not easy, but you're making steady progress, and that's something to be proud of.\n\nBefore we finish, let's take a moment to check in on your current mood and any final thoughts you have about today's session. How are you feeling right now?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful than when we started. It's helpful to have some concrete strategies to work on, like scheduling self-care and setting boundaries. I know it won't be easy, but I feel a little more empowered to take care of myself.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and empowered, Priya. Those are great signs of progress. Remember that change takes time, and there will be ups and downs along the way. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you continue this journey.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the strategies we've discussed. Keep using thought records to challenge negative thoughts, and try to schedule at least one self-care activity each day. Also, see if you can set a small boundary at work, like leaving on time at least once this week.\n\nWe'll check in on your progress with these tasks at our next session. In the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out if you need support or have any questions.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll do my best to practice these strategies this week, and I'll let you know how it goes at our next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed Priya's thought records and experiences with challenging negative thoughts and beliefs related to perfectionism, self-worth, and relationships.\n  - Explored Priya's core belief that she needs to be perfect to deserve love and respect, and discussed strategies for challenging this belief.\n  - Discussed the importance of prioritizing self-care and setting boundaries, particularly in the context of work-life balance.\n  - Checked in on Priya's current mood and progress with managing depressive symptoms.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (continued from previous sessions): Priya will continue using thought records to challenge negative thoughts related to perfectionism, self-worth, and relationships.
