  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Priya, it's great to see you again for our fourth session. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. However, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities within these constraints. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the transparency, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your support. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the techniques we discussed. I've been keeping up with my thought records and practicing behavioral activation. It's been challenging at times, but I do feel a slight improvement in my mood.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been working on the techniques and noticing some improvement in your mood, Priya. Can you share more about your experience with keeping thought records and practicing behavioral activation? What challenges have you faced, and how have you been managing them?\n\nPatient: Keeping the thought records has been helpful in identifying my negative thought patterns, especially all-or-nothing thinking and overgeneralization. However, I sometimes find it difficult to challenge these thoughts and come up with alternative perspectives. As for behavioral activation, I've been trying to engage in activities I enjoy, like painting and reading, but I often feel guilty for taking time away from work.\n\nTherapist: It's common to face challenges when learning new skills, and I appreciate your honesty, Priya. We can definitely work on strategies to make it easier to challenge your negative thoughts and find balance between work and self-care. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?\n\nPatient: I'd like to focus on developing more effective ways to challenge my negative thoughts and finding ways to manage the guilt I feel when taking time for myself. I also want to discuss how I can better maintain my social connections, as I've been struggling with that.\n\nTherapist: Those are great priorities, Priya. Let's start by exploring your experience with challenging negative thoughts, and then we can discuss strategies for managing guilt and maintaining social connections. We'll also review your progress with behavioral activation and thought records, and introduce some new techniques for distress tolerance and relaxation. How does that sound?",
