  "transcript": "Patient: I've noticed that I'm able to catch myself when I start having negative thoughts and challenge them more easily. I'm also setting better boundaries at work and with my family, which has helped reduce my stress levels. I feel like I have more control over my emotions and my life in general.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Marcus. You've made significant progress in recognizing and challenging negative thoughts, as well as setting healthy boundaries. These skills have clearly had a positive impact on your mood and overall well-being. Let's talk about how you can maintain this progress moving forward. What strategies have you found most helpful in managing your depression symptoms?\n\nPatient: I think the cognitive restructuring has been the most helpful for me. Being able to identify and challenge my negative thoughts has made a big difference in how I feel day-to-day. I've also found the boundary-setting to be really important, especially at work. It's helped me prioritize my own well-being and not take on more than I can handle.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've identified cognitive restructuring and boundary-setting as key strategies for managing your depression symptoms. These are skills that you can continue to use and build upon even after our sessions have ended. Remember, the goal of therapy is for you to become your own therapist, equipped with the tools and knowledge to manage your mental health independently. How confident do you feel in your ability to continue using these skills on your own?\n\nPatient: I feel pretty confident, but I know there will be challenges and setbacks along the way. That's why I think it's important to have a plan in place for how to handle those situations when they arise.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Marcus. Having a plan in place for managing setbacks and challenges is crucial for maintaining your progress. Let's work together to create a personalized \"toolbox\" of CBT skills and strategies that you can refer to when you need support. This might include things like reviewing your thought records, practicing relaxation techniques, or reaching out to a trusted friend or family member for support. What are some other tools you'd like to include in your toolbox?",
