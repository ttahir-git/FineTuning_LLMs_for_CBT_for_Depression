  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some excellent points, Marcus. As we wrap up our session today, I want to take a moment to review the progress we've made and discuss some strategies for continuing this work going forward.\n\nOver the past few sessions, we've been focusing on developing your skills in cognitive restructuring, setting boundaries, and using the positive data log to challenge negative self-talk. You've been practicing these skills both in and out of our sessions, and I've noticed a significant improvement in your ability to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts and beliefs.\n\nAs we continue our work together, I encourage you to keep practicing these skills on a daily basis. Remember, the more you practice, the more automatic these new patterns of thinking will become.\n\nIn addition to the skills we've been working on, I want to introduce a new tool that can help you maintain your progress and prevent relapse. It's called a \"wellness action plan,\" and it outlines specific steps you can take if you start to notice your depression symptoms worsening.\n\nSome key components of a wellness action plan might include:\n\n1. Identifying early warning signs of depression, such as changes in sleep, appetite, or energy levels\n2. Developing a list of self-care strategies that you can use to manage these symptoms, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, or reaching out to a friend\n3. Creating a list of emergency contacts, including your therapist, a trusted friend or family member, and crisis hotlines\n4. Planning for ongoing support, such as scheduling periodic \"booster\" sessions with your therapist or joining a support group\n\nWhat do you think about creating a wellness action plan for yourself, Marcus?\n\nPatient: I think that's a great idea. Having a concrete plan in place would make me feel more prepared to handle any setbacks or challenges that come up.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that. Let's take some time now to start brainstorming some of the components of your wellness action plan. What are some early warning signs of depression that you've noticed in yourself?\n\nPatient: Well, I know that when I start having trouble sleeping or lose interest in things I usually enjoy, that's often a sign that my depression is getting worse.\n\nTherapist: Those are great observations, Marcus. What are some self-care strategies that you've found helpful in the past for managing those symptoms?\n\nPatient: Exercise usually helps me a lot, even if it's just going for a short walk. I also find that reaching out to a friend or family member can be really helpful, even if it's just to chat about something unrelated to my depression.\n\nTherapist: Those are both excellent strategies. What about emergency contacts? Who are some people you could reach out to if you were really struggling?\n\nPatient: I know I could always call my sister or my best friend. They've both been really supportive in the past. And of course, I could always reach out to you if I needed to.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Marcus. I'm always here for you if you need support. Let's add those contacts to your wellness action plan.\n\nFinally, let's talk about ongoing support. What are some options you might consider for continuing to get support after our therapy sessions end?\n\nPatient: I've heard about some support groups in my area for people with depression. I think that could be really helpful. And like you mentioned, I could always schedule a \"booster\" session with you if I felt like I needed a little extra support.\n\nTherapist: Those are both great options, Marcus. I'm glad you're thinking ahead about how to maintain your progress.\n\nAs we wrap up our session today, I want to leave you with a few final thoughts. First, remember that progress isn't always linear, and setbacks are a normal part of the recovery process. The key is to keep practicing your skills and reaching out for support when you need it.\n\nSecond, I want to acknowledge the hard work you've been doing in therapy. You've shown a lot of courage and commitment in facing your challenges head-on, and I'm confident that you have the tools and the strength to continue making progress.\n\nFinally, I want to remind you that you don't have to do this alone. You have a strong support system, and I'm always here for you if you need me.\n\nWhat are some thoughts or feelings coming up for you as we wrap up our session today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling really grateful for all the progress I've made and for your support throughout this process. I know I still have work to do, but I feel more confident in my ability to handle whatever challenges come my way.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Marcus. I'm so glad that our work together has been helpful for you.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing your cognitive restructuring and positive data log skills. I also invite you to start working on your wellness action plan, adding in the components we discussed today and any others that feel relevant to you.\n\nIn our next session, we can review your wellness action plan and discuss any other topics that feel important to you. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds great. I'll definitely work on my wellness action plan and keep practicing my skills.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. I look forward to hearing about your progress next week. Take care, Marcus.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed progress in cognitive restructuring, setting boundaries, and using the positive data log\n  - Introduced the concept of a wellness action plan for maintaining progress and preventing relapse\n  - Discussed early warning signs of depression, self-care strategies, emergency contacts, and options for ongoing support\n  - Checked in on patient's current mood and final thoughts\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Cognitive restructuring (ongoing)\n  - Positive data log (ongoing)\n  - Boundary-setting (ongoing)\n  - Wellness action plan (new)\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue practicing cognitive restructuring and positive data log skills\n  - Start working on wellness action plan, including early warning signs, self-care strategies, emergency contacts, and options for ongoing support\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - Patient reported feeling more confident in ability to handle challenges and setbacks\n  - Acknowledged progress made in therapy and gratitude for therapist's support\n  - Depression symptoms continue to improve, with occasional setbacks\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Not discussed in this session\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Review patient's wellness action plan and provide feedback and support\n  - Continue monitoring progress in cognitive restructuring, boundary-setting, and positive data log\n  - Explore any new challenges or insights that come up in the week ahead\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review patient's wellness action plan and discuss any questions or concerns\n  - Check in on progress with cognitive restructuring, boundary-setting, and positive data log\n  - Explore any new challenges or topics that feel important to the patient\n  - Continue providing support and encouragement for patient's progress and recovery",
