  "transcript": "Patient: Those are great suggestions, Nova. I like the idea of using a \"meta-thought record\" to challenge negative thoughts about setbacks. And having a list of self-care activities to turn to is really helpful. I think I'll add those strategies to my wellness action plan.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad those strategies resonate with you, Marcus. Let's take a few minutes now to practice using a meta-thought record. Can you think of a recent setback or challenge you experienced that we could use as an example?\n\nPatient: Sure, let me think. Well, last week at work, I made a mistake on a project, and my boss called me out on it in a team meeting. I felt really embarrassed and started having thoughts like \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'll never be successful.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Marcus. Let's use those thoughts to practice a meta-thought record. First, let's identify the situation: making a mistake on a project and being called out by your boss. What emotions did you feel in that moment?\n\nPatient: I felt embarrassed, ashamed, and discouraged. I also felt anxious about my job security.\n\nTherapist: Those are understandable emotions in that situation, Marcus. Now, let's look at the thoughts you identified: \"I'm not good enough\" and \"I'll never be successful.\" What evidence do you have that supports or refutes those thoughts?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been successful in my career so far. I've gotten promotions and positive feedback from colleagues and clients. But I also have a history of struggling with self-doubt and feeling like an impostor.\n\nTherapist: That's an important insight, Marcus. You have evidence of your success and competence, but you also have a pattern of self-doubt that can be triggered by setbacks. Let's look at an alternative perspective. Could it be possible that making a mistake doesn't define your overall worth or potential for success?\n\nPatient: I guess that's true. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. It doesn't mean I'm not good enough or that I'll never be successful.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Marcus. Making a mistake is a normal part of being human and doesn't determine your overall worth or potential. Let's add that alternative thought to your meta-thought record. How do you feel when you consider that perspective?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit better. Less discouraged and more hopeful. It reminds me that setbacks are temporary and don't define me.\n\nTherapist: That's a great realization, Marcus. This is a skill you can practice whenever you face a setback or challenge. By challenging those negative thoughts, you can shift your perspective and feel more resilient. Let's add this meta-thought record to your wellness action plan as a tool for handling setbacks.\n\nPatient: That's a good idea, Nova. I'm feeling more prepared to handle challenges now. I know it won't always be easy, but I have strategies to cope.\n\nTherapist: You absolutely do, Marcus. You've developed a strong set of skills throughout our work together, and I'm confident in your ability to use them moving forward. Remember, setbacks are a normal part of the process, and they don't define your overall progress or potential.",
