  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for session 12. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. Since our last session, I've been trying to implement the self-care activities we discussed, like taking short walks during my lunch break and setting aside time to unwind in the evening. It hasn't been easy, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and overall well-being. However, I'm still struggling with feelings of worthlessness and negative thoughts about my work performance and self-worth.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been making an effort to prioritize self-care and that you've noticed some improvements in your mood. It's also important that you're recognizing the ongoing challenges with feelings of worthlessness and negative thoughts. Let's make sure to address these concerns during our session today. Before we set our agenda, can you share a bit more about how these thoughts and feelings have been impacting you since our last session?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been trying to use the thought records and behavioral activation techniques we've been working on, but I find it hard to stay consistent. I get caught up in work and my other responsibilities, and sometimes I forget to prioritize my mental health. When I do have negative thoughts, it's difficult to challenge them in the moment, and I end up feeling stuck in that negative mindset.\n\nTherapist: Consistency can be a challenge, especially when you're juggling multiple responsibilities. It's good that you're aware of the obstacles you're facing. Today, let's focus on strategies to help you stay more consistent with the techniques we've been working on. We can also explore some additional tools to help you challenge those negative thoughts more effectively in the moment. Does that sound like a good plan for our session today?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds great. I really want to work on being more consistent and finding ways to cope with negative thoughts when they arise.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. So, our agenda for today will include:\n1. Reviewing your experience with the homework assignments, including thought records, behavioral activation, and self-care activities\n2. Discussing your progress, challenges, and any new insights or questions that have come up since the last session\n3. Exploring strategies to help you stay consistent with the techniques we've been working on\n4. Introducing additional tools to help you challenge negative thoughts more effectively in the moment\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today's session?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers everything. I'm looking forward to working on these areas.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your experience with the homework assignments. Can you share how it went with the thought records, behavioral activation, and self-care activities we discussed last time?",
