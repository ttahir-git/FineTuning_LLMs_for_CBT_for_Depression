  "transcript": "Patient: I like the idea of having those coping cards with me wherever I go. It's like having a little piece of therapy with me all the time.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Marcus. The coping cards are a way to keep the insights and skills you've gained in therapy close at hand, so you can access them whenever you need a boost. Remember, the goal of therapy is for you to become your own therapist, equipped with the tools and knowledge to manage your mental health independently.\n\nAs we wrap up our work together, I want to emphasize that progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. The key is to keep moving forward, one step at a time, and to reach out for support when you need it. You've made incredible progress, and I have full confidence in your ability to continue using these skills and insights to maintain your well-being.\n\nBefore we end our session, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now, and what are some of your final thoughts as we conclude our scheduled sessions?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a mix of emotions right now. I'm proud of the progress I've made and grateful for your support and guidance. At the same time, I'm a bit nervous about not having our regular sessions to look forward to. But I know that I have the tools and the support system to keep moving forward.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions as we conclude our scheduled sessions. It's a significant milestone in your journey, and it's natural to feel both pride in your progress and some nervousness about the future. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. You have a strong support system, and I'm always here if you need a booster session or check-in.\n\nFor your homework, I'd like you to continue practicing the skills we've worked on, like cognitive restructuring, boundary-setting, and using your coping cards. Keep working on your wellness action plan, and consider sharing it with a trusted friend or family member for additional support and accountability.\n\nIn our next session, if you decide to schedule one, we can check in on your progress, discuss any challenges or setbacks you've encountered, and continue to refine your relapse prevention plan. Remember, therapy is not the end of your journey, but rather a launching point for continued growth and well-being.\n\nThank you for your hard work and dedication, Marcus. It's been an honor to support you on this journey.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed patient's progress and reinforced learning of CBT skills\n  - Created a personalized \"toolbox\" of CBT skills and strategies for patient to use independently\n  - Developed a relapse prevention plan, including identifying early warning signs and strategies to cope with setbacks\n  - Discussed patient's feelings about ending scheduled therapy sessions and strategies for continuing progress independently\n  - Checked in on patient's current mood and final thoughts\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Cognitive restructuring (ongoing)\n  - Positive data log (ongoing)\n  - Boundary-setting (ongoing)\n  - Wellness action plan (reviewed and refined)\n  - Meta-thought record (new)\n  - Coping cards (new)\n  - Support planning (new)\n  - Gradual termination (new)\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue practicing cognitive restructuring, boundary-setting, and positive data log skills\n  - Keep working on wellness action plan and consider sharing with a trusted friend or family member for support and accountability\n  - Create coping cards with reminders of adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs\n  - Use relaxation techniques and engage in enjoyable activities as part of self-care routine\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - Patient reported feeling more prepared to handle challenges and setbacks independently\n  - Expressed pride in progress made in therapy and gratitude for therapist's support\n  - Discussed feelings of nervousness about ending scheduled therapy sessions and strategies for continuing progress\n  - Depression symptoms continue to improve, with occasional setbacks\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Not discussed in this session\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue monitoring patient's progress in using CBT skills independently\n  - Explore patient's experience with sharing wellness action plan with a trusted friend or family member\n  - Assess patient's need for ongoing support, such as periodic booster sessions or support groups\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - As this is the final scheduled session, no specific plan for the next session\n  - Patient encouraged to continue using CBT skills independently and to reach out for support as needed\n  - Therapist available for booster sessions or check-ins as needed in the future",
