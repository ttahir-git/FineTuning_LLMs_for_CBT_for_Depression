  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you walking me through that example, Nova. It helps me see how I can apply these skills in real-life situations.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Marcus. Practice is key when it comes to setting boundaries and reframing thoughts. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps. \n\nPatient: I have a question about the positive data log. I've been trying to record something positive each day, but some days it's really hard to find something. What should I do on those days?\n\nTherapist: That's a great question, Marcus. On days when it's challenging to find something positive, try to look for small moments of accomplishment or joy, even if they seem insignificant. It could be something as simple as getting out of bed when you didn't feel like it, or taking a moment to appreciate a beautiful sunset. The goal is to train your brain to notice and focus on the positive aspects of your life, even amidst challenges.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I've been putting pressure on myself to come up with big, significant positive things, but it's okay to start small.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Marcus. Celebrating small wins is an important part of building momentum and shifting your perspective. And remember, it's okay if some days are harder than others. The fact that you're making an effort to find something positive is a win in itself.\n\nPatient: Thanks for that reminder, Nova. I'll try to be more mindful of the small positive moments, even on tough days.\n\nTherapist: I think that's a great goal, Marcus. As we continue to work on reframing thoughts and setting boundaries, you may find that it becomes easier to notice and appreciate the positive aspects of your life. \n\nPatient: I hope so. It's been a challenging journey, but I'm starting to see some glimmers of progress.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Marcus. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have ups and downs. What matters is that you keep showing up for yourself and putting in the effort, even when it's hard.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. Your support and guidance mean a lot to me.\n\nTherapist: I'm here to support you every step of the way, Marcus. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. In addition to our sessions, don't hesitate to reach out to your support system when you need a boost.\n\nPatient: I'll try to remember that. I have a tendency to isolate myself when I'm feeling down, but I know that reaching out can make a big difference.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Marcus. Reaching out for support is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes courage to be vulnerable and ask for help when you need it.\n\nPatient: I'm starting to see that. It's just hard to break old habits and patterns of thinking.\n\nTherapist: I understand, Marcus. That's why we're taking it one step at a time. Every small shift in perspective and behavior adds up over time. Let's continue to work on reframing thoughts and setting boundaries, and celebrate the progress you're making along the way.",
