  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you walking me through that example, Nova. It helps me see how I can apply these skills in real-life situations.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Marcus. Practice is key when it comes to setting boundaries and reframing thoughts. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps. \n\nPatient: I have a question about the positive data log. I've been trying to record something positive each day, but some days it's really hard to find something. What should I do on those days?\n\nTherapist: That's a great question, Marcus. On days when it's challenging to find something positive, try to look for small moments of accomplishment or joy, even if they seem insignificant. It could be something as simple as getting out of bed when you didn't feel like it, or taking a moment to appreciate a beautiful sunset. The goal is to train your brain to notice and focus on the positive aspects of your life, even amidst challenges.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I've been putting pressure on myself to come up with big, significant positive things, but it's okay to start small.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Marcus. Celebrating small wins is an important part of building momentum and shifting your perspective. And remember, it's okay if some days are harder than others. The fact that you're making an effort to find something positive is a win in itself.\n\nPatient: Thanks for that reminder, Nova. I'll try to be more mindful of the small positive moments, even on tough days.\n\nTherapist: I think that's a great goal, Marcus. As we continue to work on reframing thoughts and setting boundaries, you may find that it becomes easier to notice and appreciate the positive aspects of your life. \n\nPatient: I hope so. It's been a challenging journey, but I'm starting to see some glimmers of progress.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Marcus. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have ups and downs. What matters is that you keep showing up for yourself and putting in the effort, even when it's hard.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. Your support and guidance mean a lot to me.\n\nTherapist: I'm here to support you every step of the way, Marcus. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. In addition to our sessions, don't hesitate to reach out to your support system when you need a boost.\n\nPatient: I'll try to remember that. I have a tendency to isolate myself when I'm feeling down, but I know that reaching out can make a big difference.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Marcus. Reaching out for support is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes courage to be vulnerable and ask for help when you need it.\n\nPatient: I'm starting to see that. It's just hard to break old habits and patterns of thinking.\n\nTherapist: I understand, Marcus. That's why we're taking it one step at a time. Every small shift in perspective and behavior adds up over time. Let's continue to work on reframing thoughts and setting boundaries, and celebrate the progress you're making along the way.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed and practiced boundary-setting language and strategies\n  - Challenged negative thoughts related to setting boundaries using thought records\n  - Discussed the positive data log and the importance of celebrating small wins\n  - Explored the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (CBT triangle)\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records (ongoing from previous sessions)\n  - Self-compassion practice (ongoing from previous sessions)\n  - Boundary-setting language and practice (new)\n  - Positive data log (new)\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Practice boundary-setting language in at least one situation this week\n  - Continue using thought records to challenge negative thoughts related to setting boundaries\n  - Continue with the positive data log, focusing on small moments of accomplishment or joy each day\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - Patient reported some ups and downs in mood since the last session, with good days and bad days\n  - Identified challenges with setting boundaries at work and in social situations\n  - Depression symptoms continue to include negative self-talk, feelings of overwhelm, and difficulty getting out of bed on some days\n  - Patient showed insight and motivation to practice new skills and challenge negative thoughts\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Core belief: \"I need to be available and accommodating at all times, or people will think I'm lazy or selfish\"\n  - Intermediate belief: \"If I set boundaries, I'll miss out on opportunities and damage my relationships\"\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue monitoring patient's progress with boundary-setting and thought records\n  - Review positive data log and celebrate wins in the next session\n  - Explore any new challenges or insights that come up in the week ahead\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - Review patient's experience with homework assignments, including boundary-setting practice, thought records, and positive data log\n  - Discuss any challenges or questions that came up while practicing new skills\n  - Continue exploring beliefs about setting boundaries and self-worth, and introduce additional techniques for challenging these beliefs as appropriate\n  - Check in on patient's overall mood and any changes in depression symptoms",
