  "transcript": "Patient: Yes, that makes sense. It's interesting to see how my thoughts are connected to my feelings and behaviors.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. And the good news is that by working on changing our thoughts, we can start to shift those feelings and behaviors in a more positive direction. One way we do this in CBT is by identifying what we call \"cognitive distortions.\" These are common patterns of thinking that are often inaccurate and unhelpful.\n\nFor example, one cognitive distortion is \"all-or-nothing thinking,\" where we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms. Another is \"catastrophizing,\" where we assume the worst possible outcome will happen. Does either of those sound familiar to you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I can definitely relate to both of those. I often think in extremes, like if I make a mistake at work, I think \"I'm a total failure.\" And I tend to assume the worst, like if my partner is late coming home, I immediately think \"something terrible must have happened.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples, Marcus. All-or-nothing thinking and catastrophizing are very common cognitive distortions. Another one is \"disqualifying the positive,\" where we dismiss or downplay positive experiences or qualities about ourselves. For instance, if you receive a compliment or accomplish something, you might think \"that doesn't count\" or \"I just got lucky.\"\n\nCan you think of any times when you might have engaged in disqualifying the positive?\n\nPatient: Definitely. Just the other day, my boss praised me for my work on a project, but I immediately thought \"he's just saying that to be nice\" and \"I could have done better.\" I have a hard time accepting compliments or acknowledging my own achievements.",
