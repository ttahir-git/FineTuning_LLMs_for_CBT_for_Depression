  "transcript": "Patient: I can see how challenging my thoughts and setting boundaries are related. When I'm not setting boundaries, I'm more likely to feel overwhelmed and have negative thoughts about myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Marcus! You're absolutely right. When we don't set boundaries, we can end up taking on too much, which can lead to feelings of overwhelm, resentment, and negative self-talk. By setting boundaries, we're not only protecting our time and energy, but we're also taking care of our emotional well-being.\n\nPatient: It makes sense, but it's still hard to put into practice. I feel like I need to be available all the time, especially at work.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel that way, especially in a work environment that values productivity and responsiveness. However, being available all the time isn't sustainable, and it can actually lead to burnout and decreased performance in the long run.\n\nPatient: I know you're right, but I worry about how my colleagues and boss will react if I start setting more boundaries.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern. Let's explore that a bit more. What do you think might happen if you start setting more boundaries at work?\n\nPatient: I'm afraid that they'll think I'm not a team player or that I'm not committed to my job. I don't want to be seen as lazy or uncooperative.\n\nTherapist: Those are common fears when it comes to setting boundaries, but I want to challenge those thoughts a bit. First, let's consider the evidence. Have you ever worked with someone who set healthy boundaries? Did you think they were lazy or uncooperative?\n\nPatient: Now that you mention it, there is a colleague who is really good at setting boundaries. She's actually one of the most respected people on our team. She's always clear about what she can and can't take on, and people really appreciate her honesty.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example! It shows that setting boundaries doesn't necessarily lead to negative perceptions. In fact, it can actually increase respect and trust in the long run. People appreciate knowing what to expect and feeling confident that you'll follow through on your commitments.\n\nPatient: That's true. I guess I never really thought about it that way before.\n\nTherapist: It's a different perspective, isn't it? Setting boundaries is actually a way of communicating clearly and managing expectations, which can lead to better working relationships.\n\nPatient: I can see that now. I think I need to work on reframing how I think about boundaries.\n\nTherapist: That's a great goal, and we can definitely work on that together. As you practice setting boundaries, it can be helpful to have some specific language to use. For example, you might say something like, \"I'm currently at capacity with my workload, but I'd be happy to take that on next week once I've completed my current projects.\" How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds doable. I like having a clear script to follow.\n\nTherapist: Great! We can practice that language together and come up with some other options that feel comfortable for you. Remember, setting boundaries is a skill that takes practice, so be patient with yourself as you're learning.\n\nPatient: I will. It's helpful to know that it's okay to take it one step at a time.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely! Every small step counts, and it's all part of the process of taking care of yourself and your mental health. Speaking of which, how has your mood been since our last session?\n\nPatient: It's been up and down. I've had some good days where I feel more positive and motivated, but I've also had some days where I feel really down and struggle to get out of bed.\n\nTherapist: It's normal to have ups and downs, especially when you're dealing with depression. I'm glad to hear that you've had some good days, though. What do you think has contributed to those more positive days?\n\nPatient: I think it's a combination of things. On the days when I'm able to get outside for a walk or spend time with friends, I tend to feel better. I've also been trying to be more mindful of my self-talk and challenge those negative thoughts when they come up.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic! It's great to hear that you're incorporating some of the skills we've been working on, like behavioral activation and thought challenging. It's also helpful to notice the patterns in your mood and what helps you feel better. That can be really useful information as we continue to work on managing your depression.\n\nPatient: It's still a work in progress, but I do feel like I'm making some progress. It's just hard to keep it up sometimes.\n\nTherapist: I hear you. It can be challenging to maintain those positive changes, especially when depression makes everything feel more difficult. That's why it's so important to be kind to yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. Every step counts, no matter how small it might seem.\n\nPatient: That's a good reminder. I tend to focus on the negative and discount the progress I've made.\n\nTherapist: That's a common tendency, but it's something we can work on together. One strategy that can be helpful is to keep a \"positive data log,\" where you write down any positive experiences, accomplishments, or moments of joy, no matter how small. That way, you have a record of the good things that happen, even on the tough days. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's like creating a highlight reel of the good moments.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! It's a way of training your brain to notice and remember the positive, which can help counteract the negative bias that often comes with depression. We can add that to your homework for this week, along with continuing to practice setting boundaries and challenging negative thoughts. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nTherapist: Great! I'm excited to hear how it goes. Remember, the goal isn't to be perfect or to feel happy all the time. It's just about noticing and appreciating the good moments when they happen.",
