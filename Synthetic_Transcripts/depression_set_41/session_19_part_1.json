  "transcript": "Therapist: Hi Marcus, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been doing alright. I've been trying to practice the skills we've discussed, like cognitive restructuring and setting boundaries. It's been challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making progress. I've also started working on my wellness action plan, which has been helpful to think about.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've discussed and that you're making progress, Marcus. I'm also glad to hear that you've started working on your wellness action plan. Can you tell me more about how that's been going and what you've included in your plan so far?\n\nPatient: Sure. In my wellness action plan, I've been focusing on identifying my early warning signs of depression and strategies to cope with them. For example, I know that when I start isolating myself and avoiding social interactions, it's often a sign that my depression might be worsening. So, one of my strategies is to reach out to a friend or family member when I notice myself starting to withdraw. I've also been thinking about self-care strategies, like making sure I'm getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities I enjoy, like photography.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Marcus. It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into your wellness action plan, and you've identified some key strategies for managing your depression. Reaching out to others when you start to isolate yourself is a great way to break the cycle of depression. And prioritizing self-care activities, like sleep, nutrition, and hobbies, can make a big difference in your overall well-being. Let's discuss your wellness action plan in more detail today and see if there are any other strategies we can add or refine.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'd also like to talk about how to handle setbacks and challenges that might come up in the future. Even though I feel like I'm making progress, I know that recovery isn't always a straight line.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Marcus. Setbacks and challenges are a normal part of the recovery process, and it's important to have a plan for how to handle them. We can definitely discuss that today. So, for our agenda, it sounds like we'll be focusing on:\n\n1. Reviewing and refining your wellness action plan\n2. Discussing strategies for handling setbacks and challenges\n3. Checking in on your progress with cognitive restructuring, boundary-setting, and the positive data log\n\nDoes that sound good to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: That sounds great, Nova. I think that covers everything I wanted to discuss today. I'm looking forward to working on my wellness action plan and talking about how to handle setbacks.",
