  "transcript": "Patient: I've been thinking about what you said about setting boundaries, and I'm not sure where to start. I feel like I'm always saying yes to everything, even when I don't have the capacity.\n\nTherapist: Setting boundaries can be challenging, especially if you're used to putting others' needs before your own. Let's start by identifying some areas in your life where you'd like to set better boundaries. What are some situations where you find yourself saying yes when you really want to say no?\n\nPatient: Well, at work, I often take on extra projects, even when I'm already overloaded. I also have a hard time saying no to social invitations, even when I'm exhausted and need some downtime.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples. Recognizing situations where you struggle with boundaries is an important first step. Now, let's explore why it's difficult for you to say no in those situations. What thoughts or beliefs come up for you when you consider setting boundaries?\n\nPatient: I guess I worry that if I say no, people will think I'm lazy or selfish. I don't want to let anyone down or damage my relationships.\n\nTherapist: It's common to worry about how others will perceive us when we set boundaries. However, it's important to remember that setting healthy boundaries is an act of self-care and can actually strengthen relationships in the long run. Let's challenge some of those beliefs using a thought record.\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds helpful.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start with the situation of taking on extra projects at work. What are some of the thoughts that come up for you in that situation?\n\nPatient: I think things like, \"If I don't take on this project, my boss will think I'm not a team player,\" or \"If I say no, I might miss out on opportunities for advancement.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are valid concerns. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that saying no to a project will lead to negative consequences?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I don't have any concrete evidence. It's more of a fear than a fact.\n\nTherapist: That's an important distinction. Now, let's consider the evidence against those thoughts. Have you ever said no to a project and still been respected by your boss and colleagues?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. There was one time when I was completely overwhelmed, and I had to turn down a project. My boss was understanding, and it didn't seem to affect our relationship.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how setting boundaries can be respected by others. Now, let's come up with an alternative thought that's more balanced and based on the evidence.\n\nPatient: How about, \"It's okay to say no to a project when I'm already at capacity. Setting boundaries is a sign of self-respect and can help me perform better in the long run.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought! It acknowledges the importance of self-care and the potential benefits of setting boundaries. How does that thought feel compared to the original ones?\n\nPatient: It feels more empowering and less anxiety-provoking. I can see how challenging my thoughts can help me feel more confident in setting boundaries.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! With practice, this process of challenging thoughts and setting boundaries will become more natural. As we continue to work on this, you'll likely find it easier to assert your needs in a healthy way.\n\nPatient: I'm looking forward to practicing this more. It's a relief to know that I don't have to say yes to everything.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right. Learning to set boundaries is a crucial part of self-care and maintaining healthy relationships. Remember, it's a skill that takes time to develop, so be patient with yourself as you practice.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you for helping me work through this.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome! I'm here to support you every step of the way. As we continue our work together, we'll keep exploring how to set boundaries and challenge the thoughts that hold you back.",
