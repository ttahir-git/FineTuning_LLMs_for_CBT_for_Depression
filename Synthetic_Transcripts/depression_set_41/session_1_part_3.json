  "transcript": "Therapist: It sounds like you've been through a lot, Marcus. Losing a parent is a profound loss, and it makes sense that you're still feeling the impact of that. On top of that, the everyday stressors of work and life can really take a toll. I'm wondering, in the midst of all of this, what kinds of things have you been doing to cope with your depression?\n\nPatient: Honestly, not much. I've been trying to just push through it, but that's not really working. I spend a lot of time playing video games or watching TV, just trying to distract myself from how I'm feeling. But it's not a long-term solution.\n\nTherapist: It's common for people to turn to distraction as a way of coping with difficult emotions. And while it can provide some temporary relief, you're right that it's not a sustainable solution. Have you ever tried therapy before, or any other kind of treatment for your depression?\n\nPatient: No, this is my first time. I've always been hesitant to talk about my feelings. In my family, we were taught to just suck it up and keep going. But I'm starting to realize that's not working for me anymore.\n\nTherapist: It takes a lot of courage to challenge those long-held beliefs and reach out for help. It's not easy to go against what you've been taught, but it's a really important step in taking care of yourself. \n\nGiven what you've shared about your experiences and your goals for therapy, I'm starting to get a preliminary understanding of your situation. It seems like your depression is tied to a combination of factors, including the trauma of the car accident, the loss of your father, and the ongoing stressors in your life. We'll need to work on developing healthier coping mechanisms and building a stronger support system, as well as addressing some of the underlying beliefs that might be contributing to your depression.\n\nDoes this resonate with you, Marcus? What are your thoughts on this initial understanding of your situation?",
