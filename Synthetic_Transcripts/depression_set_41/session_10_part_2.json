  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by discussing some strategies for managing negative thoughts and feelings in the moment, particularly at work. One effective technique is called \"thought stopping.\" When you notice yourself having a negative thought, mentally say \"stop\" or imagine a stop sign. This can help interrupt the negative thought pattern and create space for more balanced thinking.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I've definitely had moments where I get stuck in a negative thought spiral, and it's hard to break out of it.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Another helpful strategy is to have a list of coping statements or affirmations that you can refer to when you're feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts. These might be statements like \"I am doing my best,\" \"Everyone makes mistakes sometimes,\" or \"I have overcome challenges before, and I can do it again.\"\n\nPatient: I like that idea. Having some go-to phrases to counteract the negative thoughts could be really helpful.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely. It's also important to practice self-care and stress management techniques regularly, not just when you're feeling overwhelmed. This might include deep breathing exercises, mindfulness practices, or engaging in hobbies or activities that bring you joy and relaxation.\n\nPatient: I've been trying to be more consistent with self-care, but it's still a challenge sometimes. I get caught up in work and other responsibilities and forget to prioritize it.\n\nTherapist: That's a common challenge, Marcus. It can be helpful to schedule self-care activities into your day or week, just like you would with any other important commitment. This can help you create a more balanced and sustainable routine.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I'll try to be more intentional about scheduling self-care into my day.\n\nTherapist: Great. Remember, self-care doesn't have to be time-consuming or complicated. Even small moments of mindfulness or relaxation can make a big difference in managing stress and improving your overall well-being.\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder. I'll try to keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Marcus. Now, let's shift our focus to exploring the core belief of worthlessness that we identified in our last session. This belief seems to be at the root of many of your negative thoughts and feelings, so it's important to address it directly.\n\nPatient: I agree. It's a belief that I've struggled with for a long time, and it definitely impacts how I see myself and my abilities.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your willingness to explore this belief, Marcus. To start, let's consider where this belief might have come from. Can you think of any early experiences or messages that may have contributed to the development of this belief?",
