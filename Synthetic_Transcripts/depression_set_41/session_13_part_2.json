  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your experience with the thought records. Can you walk me through a specific situation where you found it challenging to identify evidence against your negative thoughts?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just the other day, I was working on a project at work, and I made a small mistake. Immediately, my mind started racing with thoughts like \"I'm going to get fired\" and \"I'm not good enough for this job.\" When I tried to find evidence against these thoughts, all I could think about were past mistakes and times when I felt like I wasn't measuring up.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, and it's understandable why it was challenging to find evidence against those thoughts. When we're in the midst of strong emotions, it can be difficult to see things objectively. One strategy that can help is to imagine what you would say to a friend or colleague who was in the same situation. Let's try that now. What would you say to a friend who made a small mistake at work and was worried about getting fired?\n\nPatient: I guess I would remind them that everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and that one small error doesn't define their entire work performance. I'd probably point out their strengths and accomplishments, and encourage them to keep things in perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Marcus. You're able to see the situation more clearly when you think about it from the perspective of supporting a friend. This is a technique called \"self-distancing,\" and it can be really helpful when we're struggling with negative thoughts about ourselves. Another strategy is to look for factual evidence that contradicts the negative thought. In this case, you could consider feedback you've received from colleagues or supervisors, successful projects you've completed, or times when you've overcome challenges at work.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I guess I do have a lot of evidence that I'm capable and competent at my job, even if I make mistakes sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's about learning to balance our thoughts and see the full picture, rather than getting stuck in the negative. As we continue practicing thought records, I encourage you to try out these strategies when you're struggling to find evidence against your negative thoughts. It might feel difficult at first, but with practice, it will start to feel more natural.\n\nPatient: I'll definitely give those strategies a try. It's helpful to have some concrete tools to work with.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you find them helpful. Remember, it's okay if it takes time to shift these patterns of thinking. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about prioritizing self-care. You mentioned earlier that you often put work and other responsibilities ahead of taking care of yourself. What do you think are some of the barriers that make it challenging for you to prioritize self-care?",
