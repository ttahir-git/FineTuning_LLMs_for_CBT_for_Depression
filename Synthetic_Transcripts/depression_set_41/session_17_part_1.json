  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've had some ups and downs. I tried to practice setting boundaries at work, but it was challenging. I found myself falling back into old patterns of overextending myself. I did continue with the thought records and positive data log, which helped me recognize some of the negative thoughts that were holding me back.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been continuing with the thought records and positive data log. Setting boundaries can be difficult, especially when it challenges long-standing patterns. Let's explore your experience with boundary-setting a bit more. Can you share a specific situation where you tried to set a boundary at work and what made it challenging?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, my manager asked me to take on an additional project, even though I'm already working on several others. I tried to express my concerns about taking on too much, but I found myself feeling guilty and worried about disappointing him. In the end, I agreed to the project, even though I knew it would add more stress to my plate.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, and it's a common challenge many people face when learning to set boundaries. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle. What thoughts and emotions came up for you when your manager asked you to take on the additional project?\n\nPatient: I felt anxious and overwhelmed at the thought of adding more to my workload. I also had the thought that if I didn't agree to the project, my manager would think I was lazy or not a team player. I worried that it might affect my chances for future opportunities or promotions.\n\nTherapist: Those are important insights. It sounds like the situation triggered thoughts related to your core belief that you need to be available and accommodating at all times, or people will think you're lazy or selfish. This belief led to feelings of anxiety and guilt, which influenced your behavior of agreeing to the project, even though it went against your own needs and limits. Does this resonate with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that makes sense. I can see how my thoughts and beliefs were driving my emotions and behavior in that situation.\n\nTherapist: Great. As we continue to work on setting boundaries, it's essential to address these underlying beliefs. Today, I'd like to introduce a technique called cognitive restructuring, which can help you challenge and reframe these negative thoughts and beliefs. We'll also continue practicing boundary-setting language and explore any other challenges that came up for you this week. How does that sound for our agenda today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm open to trying the cognitive restructuring technique, and I definitely want to keep working on setting boundaries.\n\nTherapist: Excellent. Before we dive into cognitive restructuring, let's start by reviewing your positive data log. Can you share a few moments of accomplishment or joy that you recorded this week?",
