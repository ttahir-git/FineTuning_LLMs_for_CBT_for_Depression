  "transcript": "Patient: Starting small with reaching out for support makes sense. I can see how sharing a minor negative thought with a trusted friend could help me build up to sharing more significant struggles over time. It's definitely scary to be vulnerable like that, but I know it's important for my growth.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Marcus. Starting small with vulnerability can help you build up your comfort and confidence over time. And you're right, it is scary to be vulnerable, but it's so important for growth and healing. I'm glad you're willing to take those small steps towards opening up to others.\n\nAs we wrap up our session today, I want to check in about how you're feeling. What's your mood like now, and do you have any final thoughts or questions?\n\nPatient: My mood is a bit better than when we started. Talking through these negative thoughts and making a plan to reframe them feels empowering. I know it's going to be hard work, but I feel a bit more hopeful than I did before. No final questions, but thank you for your support and guidance today.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that your mood has improved a bit and that you're feeling more hopeful, Marcus. I'm glad our session today felt empowering and helpful. Remember, hard work pays off, and small steps add up over time. I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to practice the reframing exercise we discussed, with the negative thought and reframe side by side and the belief ratings. Try to do this for at least one negative thought per day, and see if you notice any shifts in your belief ratings over the course of the week. I also encourage you to reach out to a trusted friend or colleague to share a minor negative thought and get their perspective on a potential reframe. Finally, continue practicing the distress tolerance techniques we've discussed, like deep breathing and grounding, when you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed.\n\nWe'll start our next session by reviewing your homework and discussing any progress or challenges. We'll also continue to explore and practice reframing negative thoughts, and we may introduce some additional CBT techniques as appropriate. If any other concerns or topics come up for you between now and our next session, feel free to bring those as well.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Managing negative thoughts about self and abilities at work, reaching out for support, vulnerability, reframing negative thoughts, belief ratings, emotional and behavioral shifts\n- Techniques or exercises used: Examining evidence for and against negative thoughts, reframing negative thoughts (with belief ratings), deep breathing (continued practice), grounding (continued practice), reaching out for support (starting small with sharing minor negative thoughts)\n- Homework assigned: Practice reframing exercise with belief ratings for at least one negative thought per day, reach out to a trusted friend or colleague to share a minor negative thought and get their perspective on a potential reframe, continue practicing distress tolerance techniques (deep breathing and grounding) when feeling overwhelmed or stressed\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details: Marcus is making progress in identifying and challenging negative thoughts, and is open to trying new techniques like reframing and reaching out for support.
