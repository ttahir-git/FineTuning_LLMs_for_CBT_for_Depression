  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you for our final scheduled session today. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a crisis situation, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted friend or family member. Finally, since our interactions are text-based, I'm not able to observe or interpret your non-verbal cues, so I'll be relying on your words to understand your experiences. With all that said, how have you been since our last session? How are you feeling about this being our final scheduled meeting?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing pretty well. I've been practicing the skills we've worked on, like cognitive restructuring and boundary-setting, and I've noticed a difference in my mood and overall well-being. I'm feeling a bit nervous about this being our last scheduled session, but I also feel more prepared to handle challenges on my own.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've worked on and noticing improvements in your mood and well-being. It's completely normal to feel a bit nervous about ending our scheduled sessions. Today, we'll focus on reinforcing what you've learned, building your confidence in using these skills independently, and creating a plan for maintaining your progress. What would you like to prioritize in our agenda for today's session?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to focus on reviewing the progress I've made, discussing strategies for maintaining my progress, and maybe creating a plan for how to handle any setbacks or challenges that might come up in the future.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan, Marcus. We can start by reviewing the progress you've made since we began our work together. Can you tell me about some of the changes you've noticed in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors?",
