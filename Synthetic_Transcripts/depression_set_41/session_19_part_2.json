  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your wellness action plan. Can you walk me through what you've included so far?\n\nPatient: Sure. As I mentioned, I've identified some early warning signs of depression, like isolating myself, having trouble sleeping, or feeling overwhelmed by small tasks. For each warning sign, I've tried to come up with a few strategies to cope. Like reaching out to a friend, practicing relaxation techniques, or breaking tasks down into smaller steps.\n\nTherapist: Those are great strategies, Marcus. I particularly like how you've tailored your coping strategies to each specific warning sign. That shows a deep understanding of your own patterns and needs. How have you found the process of creating this plan?\n\nPatient: It's been helpful to think through it all systematically. I feel more prepared to handle things if my depression starts to worsen again. But I also worry that I might not always recognize the warning signs in the moment, or I might not have the energy to use my coping strategies.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid concern, Marcus. Recovery is an ongoing process, and there will be times when it feels more challenging to use your skills. That's where having a support system can be really helpful. Have you thought about who you might reach out to if you need help recognizing warning signs or implementing your plan?\n\nPatient: I've included my partner Tanya and my best friend Kevin as emergency contacts in my plan. I trust them to be honest with me if they notice I'm struggling, and I know they'll support me in using my coping strategies. I'm also considering joining a support group for people with depression, so I can connect with others who understand what I'm going through.\n\nTherapist: Having trusted people to turn to is so important, Marcus. I'm glad you have Tanya and Kevin in your corner. And a support group could be a great way to build additional connections and get support from people who really get it. Let's add that to your wellness action plan under \"ongoing support.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I also wanted to ask about how to handle setbacks. Even with this plan, I know there will be times when I struggle. How do I keep that from derailing my progress?\n\nTherapist: Setbacks are a normal part of the recovery process, Marcus. They don't mean you've failed or that your progress isn't real. The key is to have a plan for how to handle them. One strategy is to use a \"meta-thought record\" to challenge any negative thoughts that come up around setbacks. For example, if you have a thought like \"I'm never going to get better,\" you could challenge that by looking at the evidence of your progress so far. Another strategy is to have a list of self-care activities you can turn to when you're struggling, like taking a walk, listening to music, or practicing deep breathing. What do you think might work for you?",
