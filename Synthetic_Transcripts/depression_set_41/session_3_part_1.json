  "transcript": "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that summary, Marcus. It's great to hear that you're feeling positive about our plan and that you're finding our sessions helpful so far. Before we dive into today's session, I want to take a moment to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may be inaccurate or not fully applicable to your situation. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you're considering self-harm or suicide, it's crucial that you reach out to a qualified mental health professional or emergency service immediately. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm not able to observe or interpret non-verbal cues, which can be an important aspect of therapy. With all that being said, I'm committed to doing my best to support you in your journey towards better mental health. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?\n\nPatient: No, I understand. It's good to know the boundaries of what you can and can't do. I appreciate you being upfront about it.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for your understanding, Marcus. Now, let's take a look at the agenda for today's session. First, I'd like to review the homework from our last session and discuss your experience with keeping a thought record and challenging cognitive distortions. Then, we'll work on finalizing our conceptualization of your depression from a CBT perspective. Finally, we'll start the process of setting specific, measurable goals for your therapy journey. How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I don't have anything to add right now, but I might think of something as we go along.\n\nTherapist: That's perfectly fine. We can always adjust our agenda if needed. Let's start by reviewing your homework. Can you share some examples of the cognitive distortions you noticed over the past week and how you tried to find a more balanced perspective?",
