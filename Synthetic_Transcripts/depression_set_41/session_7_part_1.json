  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for session 7. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the reframing exercise and reaching out for support like we discussed. It's still challenging at times, but I'm making progress.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you're making progress, Marcus. It's great that you've been practicing the reframing exercise and reaching out for support. Can you tell me more about your experience with these techniques over the past week? How has it been challenging, and how have you navigated those challenges?\n\nPatient: The reframing exercise has been helpful in shifting my perspective on some of my negative thoughts. However, I sometimes struggle to come up with alternative thoughts that feel believable. As for reaching out for support, I did reach out to a colleague to share a minor negative thought, and their perspective was helpful. But I still find it difficult to be vulnerable and share my struggles with others.\n\nTherapist: It's common to find it challenging to come up with believable alternative thoughts when you're just starting with reframing. The more you practice, the easier it will become. Regarding reaching out for support, it's a big step that you reached out to your colleague. Vulnerability can be scary, but it's a crucial part of building connections and getting the support you need. We can continue working on these skills together.\n\nLet's set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review your experience with the homework assignments in more detail, discuss your progress with distress tolerance techniques, and introduce a new CBT technique called \"behavioral activation.\" What would you like to prioritize in our session today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'd like to discuss my experience with the homework assignments and get your feedback. I'm also interested in learning about behavioral activation and how it can help with my depression.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start with reviewing your experience with the homework assignments. Can you share some examples of the negative thoughts you worked on reframing and how the process went for you?",
