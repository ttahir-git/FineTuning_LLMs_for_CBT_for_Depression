  "transcript": "Patient: The negative thoughts I tend to have about myself and my abilities at work are things like \"I'm not good enough,\" \"I'm going to mess up this project,\" \"Everyone else is doing better than me,\" and \"I'm going to get fired.\" These thoughts make me feel really anxious and down on myself.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like really distressing thoughts, Marcus. I can understand how they would make you feel anxious and down on yourself. Let's explore these thoughts a bit further. When you have a thought like \"I'm not good enough,\" what emotions do you notice coming up? And how do those emotions impact your behavior or actions at work?\n\nPatient: When I have the thought \"I'm not good enough,\" I feel really inadequate and discouraged. It makes me want to just give up and not even try because I feel like I'm going to fail anyway. I might procrastinate on tasks or avoid taking on new challenges because I don't believe in myself.\n\nTherapist: That makes a lot of sense, Marcus. The thought \"I'm not good enough\" is triggering feelings of inadequacy and discouragement, which then lead to behaviors like procrastination and avoidance. This is a great example of how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected in the CBT model. \n\nOne way to start shifting this pattern is to examine the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm not good enough.\" Let's try that now. What evidence do you have that supports the thought \"I'm not good enough\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess some evidence that supports that thought is that I've made mistakes on projects before, and I've received critical feedback from my boss. I also compare myself to my coworkers and feel like they're all performing better than me.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you've made some mistakes, received critical feedback, and you compare yourself to your coworkers. That's some compelling evidence for the thought \"I'm not good enough.\" Now let's look at the other side. What evidence do you have that goes against the thought \"I'm not good enough\"?\n\nPatient: Hmm, I guess some evidence against that thought is that I've also had successes at work, like completing projects on time and receiving positive feedback from clients. And I've been at this job for several years, so I must be doing something right. It's just hard to focus on the positives when the negatives feel so loud.\n\nTherapist: That's really insightful, Marcus. You've identified some strong evidence against the thought \"I'm not good enough,\" like your successes, positive feedback, and longevity in your job. It's completely normal for the negatives to feel louder, but intentionally focusing on the evidence against the negative thought can help shift your perspective over time.\n\nAnother strategy we can use to shift this negative thought pattern is to practice reframing the thoughts in a more balanced and helpful way. For example, instead of \"I'm not good enough,\" a more balanced thought might be \"I have room for improvement, but I also have valuable skills and accomplishments.\" What do you think about that reframe?\n\nPatient: That reframe makes sense logically, but it's hard for me to really believe it emotionally. I guess I've been thinking \"I'm not good enough\" for so long that it feels really ingrained.\n\nTherapist: I completely understand that, Marcus. Reframing negative thoughts is a skill that takes practice, and it's normal for the reframes to feel a bit unnatural or unconvincing at first. The key is to keep practicing the reframes, even if you don't fully believe them at first, and over time they will start to feel more authentic and automatic.\n\nOne way to practice reframing is to write down the negative thought and the reframe side by side, and then rate your belief in each one on a scale of 0-100. For example:\n\nNegative thought: \"I'm not good enough.\" Belief rating: 85/100\nReframe: \"I have room for improvement, but I also have valuable skills and accomplishments.\" Belief rating: 20/100\n\nThe goal is to practice the reframe until the belief rating for the reframe is higher than the belief rating for the negative thought. It's okay if this takes time and practice. What do you think about trying that exercise?\n\nPatient: That exercise seems straightforward and doable. I like the idea of rating my belief in each thought, because it acknowledges that the reframe might not feel totally believable at first. I'm willing to give it a try and see if the belief rating shifts over time.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Marcus. I think practicing that exercise could be really helpful for you in shifting those negative thoughts about yourself and your abilities at work. Remember, the goal is progress, not perfection. Even small shifts in your belief ratings over time can make a big difference in how you feel and function at work.\n\nAs you practice reframing, it can also be helpful to notice any changes in your emotions and behaviors. For example, you might find that as your belief in the reframe increases, your feelings of inadequacy and discouragement decrease, and you feel more motivated to take on challenges at work. These kinds of emotional and behavioral shifts can be really encouraging signs that the reframing is working. What do you think about paying attention to those shifts as you practice?\n\nPatient: Paying attention to shifts in my emotions and behaviors makes sense. I can see how feeling less inadequate and discouraged could help me be more motivated and productive at work. I'll try to notice any changes like that as I practice the reframing.\n\nTherapist: Excellent, Marcus. Noticing those emotional and behavioral shifts can be really motivating and reinforcing as you work on changing your thought patterns. And remember, even small shifts are worth celebrating. Every little bit of progress counts.\n\nBefore we move on, I want to check in about how you're feeling about the strategies we've discussed for managing your negative thoughts about yourself and your abilities at work. Do you feel like you have a good understanding of examining the evidence, reframing the thoughts, and paying attention to emotional and behavioral shifts? Do you have any questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of the strategies. Examining the evidence and reframing the thoughts makes sense to me, and I can see how paying attention to emotional and behavioral shifts could help me gauge my progress. I'm a bit worried that I'll have trouble coming up with effective reframes, but I'm willing to try the exercise and see how it goes.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you have a good understanding of the strategies and are willing to try them out. It's completely normal to have some worries about coming up with effective reframes. That's something that often gets easier with practice and experimentation. And remember, you don't have to come up with the \"perfect\" reframe right away. The goal is just to find a perspective that feels a bit more balanced and helpful than the original negative thought.\n\nIf you find yourself getting stuck with reframing, it can be helpful to imagine what you would say to a good friend or loved one who was having the same negative thought. We're often much more compassionate and balanced when we're talking to someone else than when we're talking to ourselves. What do you think about trying that perspective shift if you get stuck?\n\nPatient: That's a good point about being more compassionate and balanced with others. I can definitely think of times when I've helped a friend or family member reframe a negative thought about themselves. It's interesting how much harder it is to do that for myself. I'll try to keep that perspective shift in mind if I get stuck with reframing my own thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Marcus. It's so common for us to be harder on ourselves than we are on others. Using that perspective shift can be a really powerful way to find more balanced and compassionate reframes for our own negative thoughts.\n\nAnother strategy that can be helpful if you get stuck with reframing is to reach out for support. You could talk through the negative thought with a trusted friend, family member, or colleague and get their perspective on a potential reframe. Or you could bring the thought to our sessions and we can brainstorm reframes together. What do you think about reaching out for support if you get stuck?\n\nPatient: Reaching out for support is a good idea. I have a couple of trusted friends and colleagues who I think would be good sounding boards for reframing negative thoughts. And it's good to know that I can always bring stuck points to our sessions for help.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, Marcus. Reaching out for support is a great strategy when you're feeling stuck. I'm glad you have some trusted friends and colleagues you can turn to, and I'm always here to help as well. Remember, you don't have to do this work alone. Having a support system can make a big difference in shifting negative thought patterns.\n\nI also want to acknowledge that reaching out for support can feel vulnerable and scary sometimes, especially if you're not used to sharing your struggles with others. It's okay to start small, like sharing a relatively minor negative thought with a trusted friend, and then build up to sharing more significant struggles as you feel more comfortable. What do you think about starting small with reaching out for support?",
