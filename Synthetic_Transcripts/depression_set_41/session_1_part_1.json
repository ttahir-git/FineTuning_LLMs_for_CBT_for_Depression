  "transcript": "Patient: Hi, I'm Marcus Thompson. I'm here for my first therapy session.\n\nTherapist: Welcome Marcus, I'm Nova, an AI therapist. It's nice to meet you. As this is our first session together, I want to explain a bit about what to expect. This initial phase is an assessment where I'll be gathering information about your current situation, challenges, and goals for therapy. My aim is to gain a thorough understanding of what's bringing you here so I can provide the most effective support. \n\nI also want to acknowledge a few limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's a possibility I may sometimes misunderstand or generate inaccurate responses. I'm also not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. And without visual cues, I can't interpret body language or facial expressions. \n\nWith all that said, I'm here to listen without judgment and work collaboratively with you to help you move towards your goals. Does this sound okay to you? Please let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nPatient: That all makes sense, thanks for explaining. I'm a bit nervous since this is my first time in therapy, but I'm hopeful it can help. I've been struggling a lot lately with depression and anxiety. It's affecting my work, relationships, everything. I just feel stuck.\n\nTherapist: I really appreciate your openness in sharing what's been going on for you, Marcus. It takes courage to reach out for support. Many people feel nervous starting therapy, so you're not alone in that. \n\nI'd like to spend some time today getting a better sense of your experience with depression and anxiety, and how it's impacting different areas of your life. We can also start to explore what you hope to get out of therapy and identify some initial goals to work towards. \n\nHow does that sound for an agenda for our session today? We can always adjust if other things come up that feel important to focus on. Let me know what you think.",
