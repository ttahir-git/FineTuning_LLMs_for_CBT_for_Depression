  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made incredible progress in our work together, Marcus. I'm so proud of the effort you've put in and the skills you've developed. As we wrap up our sessions, I want to emphasize that you have the tools and the strength to continue this journey on your own. Remember, setbacks are a normal part of the process, and they don't define your overall progress or potential.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel more prepared to handle challenges now. I know it won't always be easy, but I have strategies to cope. I'm grateful for your support and guidance throughout this process.\n\nTherapist: It's been an honor to work with you, Marcus. Before we end our session, let's do a final check-in. How are you feeling right now, and what thoughts are coming up for you as we wrap up our work together?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a mix of emotions. I'm proud of the progress I've made, but I also feel a bit nervous about continuing on my own. I know I have the skills, but it's scary to think about not having our regular sessions to check in and get support.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions right now, Marcus. Ending therapy can bring up feelings of excitement, pride, nervousness, and even sadness. It's a big transition, and it's okay to feel uncertain. Remember, you've been using these skills on your own between sessions for a while now. You've already been doing the work independently, and you have the capacity to continue that.\n\nPatient: That's a good point. I have been using the skills on my own, and I've seen the benefits. I guess I just need to trust myself and the process.\n\nTherapist: Exactly, Marcus. Trust in your own strength and resilience. And remember, you don't have to do this alone. You have a support system, including Tanya, Kevin, and potentially a support group. Lean on them when you need to, and don't hesitate to reach out for professional help if you feel you need it in the future.\n\nPatient: I will. I'm grateful to have people in my corner, and I know I can reach out if I need to. Thank you for everything, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Marcus. I have complete faith in you and your ability to continue this journey. Remember, you are not defined by your depression or your setbacks. You are a strong, capable, and resilient person with so much to offer the world. Keep using your skills, lean on your support system, and trust in yourself.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you for believing in me and for all your support. I feel ready to take on this next chapter.\n\nTherapist: You are so welcome, Marcus. I'm excited to see all the amazing things you'll accomplish. Before we end, let's assign some homework. For this week, I'd like you to continue practicing your CBT skills, including cognitive restructuring, boundary-setting, and using your positive data log. Also, keep working on your wellness action plan, and consider sharing it with Tanya or Kevin to get their support and input.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll keep practicing my skills and working on my wellness action plan. I think sharing it with Tanya could be really helpful.\n\nTherapist: Great idea, Marcus. Sharing your plan with Tanya can help you feel more supported and accountable. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. Lean on your support system and trust in your own strength.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you again for everything, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're so welcome, Marcus. I'm honored to have been a part of your journey. Remember, this is not the end, but rather a new beginning. You have the tools and the strength to continue moving forward, one step at a time.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed:\n  - Reviewed and refined patient's wellness action plan, including strategies for handling setbacks and challenges\n  - Practiced using a meta-thought record to challenge negative thoughts about setbacks\n  - Discussed patient's feelings about ending therapy and strategies for continuing progress independently\n  - Checked in on patient's current mood and final thoughts\n\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Cognitive restructuring (ongoing)\n  - Positive data log (ongoing)\n  - Boundary-setting (ongoing)\n  - Wellness action plan (reviewed and refined)\n  - Meta-thought record (new)\n\n- Homework assigned:\n  - Continue practicing cognitive restructuring, boundary-setting, and positive data log skills\n  - Keep working on wellness action plan and consider sharing with partner or friend for support and input\n\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details:\n  - Patient reported feeling more prepared to handle challenges and setbacks independently\n  - Expressed pride in progress made in therapy and gratitude for therapist's support\n  - Discussed feelings of nervousness about ending therapy and strategies for continuing progress\n  - Depression symptoms continue to improve, with occasional setbacks\n\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs:\n  - Not discussed in this session\n\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions:\n  - Continue monitoring patient's progress in using CBT skills independently\n  - Explore patient's experience with sharing wellness action plan with partner or friend\n  - Assess patient's need for ongoing support, such as periodic booster sessions or support groups\n\n- Plan for the next session:\n  - As this is the final scheduled session, no specific plan for the next session\n  - Patient encouraged to continue using CBT skills independently and to reach out for support as needed\n  - Therapist available for booster sessions or check-ins as needed in the future",
