  "transcript": "Therapist: You mentioned that you'd like to focus on boundary-setting today, as that's been the most challenging for you. Let's dive deeper into that. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you struggled to set boundaries, and we can work through it together?\n\nPatient: Sure. Just last week, my manager asked me to take on an additional project, even though I'm already working on several others. I wanted to say no, but I was worried about how it would look. I ended up saying yes, and now I'm feeling overwhelmed and resentful.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Marcus. It's common to worry about how setting boundaries might be perceived by others, especially in a work setting. Let's break down this situation using the CBT triangle. What thoughts and emotions came up for you when your manager asked you to take on the additional project?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"If I say no, my manager will think I'm not a team player or that I'm not capable of handling the work.\" I felt anxious and worried about how it would impact my career. I also felt frustrated with myself for not being able to say no.\n\nTherapist: Those are important insights, Marcus. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought that your manager will think you're not a team player or capable if you say no. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess I don't have any direct evidence. It's more of an assumption based on the company culture and the expectation to always go above and beyond.\n\nTherapist: That's a good point about company culture. Now, let's consider the evidence against this thought. Have there been times when you or others have set boundaries at work without negative consequences?\n\nPatient: When I think about it, there have been a few times when my coworkers have pushed back on unrealistic deadlines or requests, and it didn't seem to negatively impact their standing with the manager. In fact, I think it might have helped them establish clearer expectations.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Marcus. It shows that setting boundaries is possible and can even lead to positive outcomes. Based on this evidence, how might you reframe your original thought?\n\nPatient: I guess I could reframe it as, \"Setting boundaries is a normal and necessary part of maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and it doesn't necessarily mean I'm not a team player or capable.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and adaptive thought, Marcus. How does that reframed thought feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It feels more empowering and less anxiety-provoking. I can see how challenging these thoughts can help me feel more confident in setting boundaries.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. As we continue to practice reframing thoughts and setting boundaries, it will become more natural over time. Remember, it's a skill that takes practice, and it's okay to start small.",
