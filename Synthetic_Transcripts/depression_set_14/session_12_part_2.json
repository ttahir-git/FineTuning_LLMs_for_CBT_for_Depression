  "transcript": "Patient: I'm glad we have a plan for today's session. I want to start by sharing my experience with the homework you assigned last time.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Mariana. I'm eager to hear about your experiences. Please go ahead and share your thoughts and any challenges you faced while working on the thought records and expressing your needs.\n\nPatient: Well, I found the thought records to be a helpful tool for identifying and challenging my negative thoughts. I noticed that I often have thoughts like \"I should be able to do this on my own\" or \"Asking for help means I'm weak.\" When I examined the evidence for and against these thoughts, I realized that they're not entirely true. For example, when I asked Miguel for help with household tasks, he was understanding and supportive, which challenged my belief that asking for help is a sign of weakness.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful that you're finding the thought records helpful in identifying and challenging your negative thoughts. Recognizing that asking for help doesn't necessarily mean you're weak is an important insight. How did you feel after challenging these thoughts?\n\nPatient: After challenging these thoughts, I felt a bit relieved and less guilty about asking for help. However, I still find it difficult to express my needs, especially when it comes to my studies and managing my chronic pain. I feel like I should be able to handle everything on my own, and asking for help makes me feel like a burden.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that you still find it challenging to express your needs, especially given your core belief about independence and strength. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a situation where you struggled to express your needs related to your studies or chronic pain?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I had a particularly bad flare-up of my fibromyalgia, and I was struggling to keep up with my coursework. I knew I needed to ask my professor for an extension on an assignment, but I felt guilty and embarrassed about asking for special treatment. I kept thinking, \"I should be able to manage this on my own\" and \"If I ask for help, my professor will think I'm not capable.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Mariana. I can see how your core belief about independence and strength is making it difficult for you to express your needs, even when you're dealing with a challenging situation like a fibromyalgia flare-up. Let's try to challenge this core belief using the downward arrow technique. Are you familiar with this technique?\n\nPatient: I remember you mentioning it briefly in a previous session, but I'm not entirely sure how it works.\n\nTherapist: The downward arrow technique is a way to uncover the underlying beliefs that drive our automatic thoughts. We start with a surface-level thought and then ask ourselves, \"If that were true, what would that mean to me?\" We keep asking this question until we reach the core belief. Let's try it with the thought \"If I ask for help, my professor will think I'm not capable.\" If that were true, what would that mean to you?\n\nPatient: If my professor thinks I'm not capable, it would mean that I'm not good enough and that I don't belong in the program.\n\nTherapist: And if that were true, what would that mean to you?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm a failure and that I can't handle challenges on my own.\n\nTherapist: And what would that mean about you as a person?\n\nPatient: It would mean that I'm weak and that I don't have what it takes to succeed.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for being so open and honest, Mariana. We've reached a core belief: \"I'm weak and don't have what it takes to succeed.\" This belief seems to be driving many of your negative thoughts and making it difficult for you to express your needs. What do you think about this core belief now that we've identified it?\n\nPatient: It's hard to admit, but I think this core belief has been holding me back for a long time. I've always prided myself on being independent and strong, but I can see how this belief is actually making it harder for me to ask for help when I need it.\n\nTherapist: Recognizing the impact of this core belief is an important step in the process of changing it. In our next sessions, we'll work on reframing this core belief and developing a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself. For now, let's practice expressing your needs in a way that challenges this core belief. Let's go back to the example of asking your professor for an extension. How could you express your needs in a way that acknowledges your strengths and challenges?\n\nPatient: I could say something like, \"I've been dealing with a flare-up of my chronic illness, which has made it difficult for me to keep up with my coursework. I'm committed to doing my best in this program, and I believe I have the skills and determination to succeed. However, I recognize that I need some extra time to complete this assignment due to my current health challenges. Would it be possible to have an extension?\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great way to express your needs while acknowledging your strengths and challenges. You're showing that you're committed to your studies and capable of success, while also recognizing that it's okay to ask for help when you need it. How does it feel to express your needs in this way?\n\nPatient: It feels a bit uncomfortable, but also empowering. I can see how expressing my needs in this way challenges my core belief about being weak and not having what it takes to succeed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Mariana. As we continue to work on challenging this core belief, it will become easier to express your needs in a way that feels authentic and empowering. For the remainder of our session, I'd like to focus on how to manage your depression symptoms when your chronic pain is worse. Can you tell me more about how your depression symptoms are affected by your fibromyalgia flare-ups?",
