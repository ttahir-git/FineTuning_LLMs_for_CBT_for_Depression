  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mariana, it's great to see you again for session 14. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: I understand, and I appreciate you being upfront about your limitations. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and mindfulness during my fibromyalgia flare-ups. It's been challenging, but I think I'm making some progress. I've also been working on my self-care plan, trying to prioritize rest and activities that bring me joy.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been actively working on the techniques we discussed and focusing on self-care. Can you tell me more about your experience with the thought records and mindfulness during your flare-ups? What aspects have been challenging, and what, if any, successes have you noticed?\n\nPatient: The thought records have been helpful in identifying negative thoughts and trying to reframe them. It's challenging to do this during a flare-up when I'm in a lot of pain and feeling really down, but I'm trying to be more aware of my thoughts and question them. Mindfulness has been a bit more difficult for me. I find it hard to focus on the present moment when I'm in pain, but I have noticed that when I can do it, even for a short time, it does help to reduce my stress and anxiety a bit.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that practicing mindfulness during a flare-up can be challenging. Even small moments of mindfulness can make a difference, so it's great that you've noticed some benefits. Remember, it's okay to start small and be gentle with yourself. What about your self-care plan? How has that been going?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to prioritize rest more, which hasn't been easy for me as I've always been very active and driven. But I'm realizing that rest is important for managing my symptoms. I've also been trying to do more of the things I enjoy, like spending time with my animals and doing some gentle stretching exercises. It's a work in progress, but I think having a plan has helped me to be more intentional about taking care of myself.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant insight, Mariana. Recognizing the importance of rest and being intentional about self-care is a big step forward. As we continue to work together, we can further refine your self-care plan to ensure it's sustainable and effective for you. Now, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to continue working on challenging my negative thoughts, especially around feeling like a burden and not being able to do the things I used to. I also want to discuss how I can better communicate my needs to Miguel and my family. I often feel guilty for asking for help, but I know I need to get better at expressing my needs.\n\nTherapist: Those are important topics to focus on, Mariana. We can definitely work on challenging those negative thoughts and developing strategies for communicating your needs effectively. I'd also like to spend some time reviewing your experience with the homework and exploring how we can make the techniques we've discussed more manageable for you during your flare-ups. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to dive in.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's start by reviewing your experience with the homework in more detail. Can you walk me through how you've been using the thought records and what specific negative thoughts you've been working on challenging?",
