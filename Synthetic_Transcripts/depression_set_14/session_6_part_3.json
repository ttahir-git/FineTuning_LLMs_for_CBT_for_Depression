  "transcript": "Patient: That sounds good. I do want to understand why I feel so guilty and inadequate, even when I know I'm doing my best.\n\nTherapist: Let's start by exploring a specific situation where you felt guilty and inadequate. Can you think of a recent example?\n\nPatient: Well, last week I had a doctor's appointment for my fibromyalgia. The doctor asked me how I was doing, and I started crying. I felt like I wasn't making any progress, and I was just a burden on everyone around me.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mariana. Let's break down that situation using the CBT triangle. What thoughts were going through your mind when you started crying in the doctor's office?\n\nPatient: I was thinking that I should be doing better by now, that I'm not trying hard enough, and that everyone would be better off without me.\n\nTherapist: And what emotions did those thoughts bring up for you?\n\nPatient: I felt really sad, guilty, and hopeless. I also felt embarrassed for crying in front of the doctor.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why you would feel that way, given the thoughts you were having. What about behaviors? What did you do or feel like doing in that moment?\n\nPatient: I wanted to just leave the appointment and go home. I didn't want to talk about it anymore.\n\nTherapist: So, in that situation, we can see how your thoughts (\"I should be doing better,\" \"I'm not trying hard enough,\" \"Everyone would be better off without me\") led to feelings of sadness, guilt, and hopelessness, which then made you want to avoid the situation by leaving the appointment. Does that fit with your experience?\n\nPatient: Yes, that's exactly how it felt.\n\nTherapist: Now, let's look at those thoughts more closely. You said you were thinking, \"I should be doing better by now.\" What do you think that thought is based on?\n\nPatient: I guess I feel like I've been dealing with this for so long, I should have figured out how to manage it better. I see other people with chronic illnesses who seem to be doing okay, and I feel like I'm failing somehow.\n\nTherapist: It's common to compare ourselves to others, but everyone's experience with chronic illness is different. What you're going through is valid and real, and it's not a reflection of your worth or effort. Let's try to reframe that thought. What's an alternative way of looking at it?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could think, \"I'm doing the best I can, and my progress is my own, not anyone else's.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Mariana. It acknowledges your efforts and validates your unique experience. How does that thought feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It feels a little better. Less judgmental, I guess.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By reframing the thought, we can start to shift the feelings and behaviors that come with it. Let's look at another thought you mentioned: \"Everyone would be better off without me.\" What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts that thought?\n\nPatient: Well, my husband Miguel is always telling me how much he loves me and wants to support me. And my friends from my fitness group check in on me and invite me to things, even when I can't always go.\n\nTherapist: So, there are people in your life who care about you and want to be there for you. That seems to contradict the thought that everyone would be better off without you. How can we reframe that thought based on this evidence?\n\nPatient: Maybe something like, \"Even though I feel like a burden sometimes, the people who love me want to support me, and my presence matters to them.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a beautiful reframe, Mariana. It acknowledges your feelings while also recognizing the love and support you have in your life. How does that thought feel?\n\nPatient: It feels comforting, like I'm not alone in this.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely not alone, Mariana. You have people who care about you, and you have your own strengths and resilience. Remembering that can help counteract those feelings of guilt and inadequacy.\n\nPatient: I think I'm starting to see how changing my thoughts can change how I feel. But what about the behaviors? How do I stop avoiding things when I feel overwhelmed?\n\nTherapist: That's a great question. One strategy is to use the skills we've been practicing, like mindfulness and grounding techniques, to help you stay present in the moment instead of avoiding it. Another strategy is to break down the situation into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, if you're feeling overwhelmed at a doctor's appointment, you could focus on just getting through one question at a time, or taking a short break to do a breathing exercise before continuing.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I like the idea of breaking things down into smaller steps.\n\nTherapist: It can be really helpful. And remember, you don't have to do it alone. You can lean on your support system, like Miguel or your friends, to help you through challenging situations.\n\nPatient: I'm not always good at asking for help, but I know I need to do it more.\n\nTherapist: Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It shows that you value yourself and your well-being enough to reach out when you need support. That's something to be proud of, Mariana.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I'm going to try to remember that.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mariana. I'm here to support you, too. As we continue working together, we'll keep practicing these skills and exploring the connections between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Remember, change takes time and practice, but you're making great progress.",
