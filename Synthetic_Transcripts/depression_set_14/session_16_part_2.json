  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying to do the thought records like we discussed, but it's been hard to find the time and energy, especially when I'm having a bad day with my fibromyalgia.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that it can be challenging to find the time and energy to practice these techniques, especially when you're dealing with physical pain and fatigue. Let's explore this a bit more. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you struggled to complete a thought record?\n\nPatient: Well, last week I had a really bad flare-up. I was in a lot of pain and couldn't get out of bed. I knew I should try to do a thought record, but I just didn't have the energy. I felt like I was failing at therapy on top of everything else.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a really difficult situation, Mariana. I want to acknowledge the effort you're putting in, even when it's challenging. When you're in that much pain, it's completely understandable that doing a thought record feels like too much. In those moments, it's okay to prioritize rest and self-care. Therapy is here to support you, not to add more stress or pressure.\n\nPatient: I guess that makes sense. I just feel like I should be able to do it all, you know? I don't want to let my pain hold me back.\n\nTherapist: I hear you, and I admire your determination. At the same time, it's important to be compassionate with yourself and recognize when you need to rest. Let's look at this situation through the lens of the thought record. What thoughts were going through your mind when you were in pain and couldn't do the thought record?\n\nPatient: I was thinking that I'm never going to get better if I can't even do these simple exercises. I felt like I was letting you down and wasting my opportunity to get help.\n\nTherapist: Those are really powerful thoughts, and I can see how they would contribute to feelings of guilt and inadequacy. Let's examine the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you're never going to get better if you can't do the thought records perfectly?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess there's no real evidence that I'll never get better. It's just a fear I have.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Mariana. Fear can often drive our negative thoughts, even when there's not much evidence to support them. What about the thought that you're letting me down or wasting your opportunity for help?\n\nPatient: I don't know. I guess I feel like if I'm not doing everything perfectly, then I'm not really trying.\n\nTherapist: I want to challenge that idea a bit. Therapy isn't about being perfect; it's about learning and growing. Every small step you take, even just being here today, is a sign of progress and effort. You're not letting me down by having bad days or struggling with the exercises sometimes. That's all part of the process.\n\nPatient: I never thought about it that way before. It's hard to let go of that perfectionism, but I can see how it's holding me back.\n\nTherapist: You're making a really important connection there, Mariana. Perfectionism can often contribute to feelings of inadequacy and make it harder to practice self-compassion. As we move forward, I'd like to work on challenging those perfectionistic thoughts and developing a more balanced perspective. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: I think that would be really helpful. I know I need to be kinder to myself, but it's hard to break those old habits.\n\nTherapist: It is hard, and it takes practice. We can work on it together. One technique that can be helpful is to imagine what you would say to a good friend who was in your situation. Would you tell them they were failing at therapy or letting anyone down?\n\nPatient: No, of course not. I would tell them to be patient with themselves and celebrate the small victories.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Mariana. Can you try to apply that same compassion and understanding to yourself?\n\nPatient: I can try. It's not easy, but I see how important it is.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad you're open to working on this. As we continue with the thought records and other exercises, let's keep this idea of self-compassion in mind. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. The important thing is that you keep trying and reach out for support when you need it.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you for being so understanding and supportive.",
