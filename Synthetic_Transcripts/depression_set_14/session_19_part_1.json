  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mariana, it's great to see you for our 19th session today. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. Since our last session, I've been doing okay. I've been trying to practice the skills we've discussed, like the Positive Data Log and setting boundaries. It's been challenging at times, but I feel like I'm making progress slowly. I had a fibromyalgia flare-up earlier this week, which made it harder to focus on my mental health, but I tried to be kind to myself and rest when I needed to.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've worked on, even though it's been challenging, especially with your fibromyalgia flare-up. It's great that you recognized the need to be kind to yourself and rest when necessary. How did setting boundaries go for you this past week?\n\nPatient: Setting boundaries has been difficult, but I did have one situation where I was able to practice. My sister called and wanted to vent about some family drama, but I was feeling really drained and knew I couldn't handle it emotionally. I told her that I cared about her but wasn't in the right headspace to talk about it at that moment. She was a bit upset, but I think she understood. It was hard, but I felt a bit lighter after standing up for my needs.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of setting boundaries in a healthy way, Mariana. It takes courage to assert your needs, especially with loved ones. It's okay if they don't always respond perfectly; what matters is that you're taking care of yourself. Let's discuss your experience with the Positive Data Log. What evidence did you gather to support your new, more adaptive beliefs?\n\nPatient: I tried to notice moments when I felt competent or capable, even in small ways. For example, I had a day where I managed to complete all my tasks on my to-do list, despite feeling tired. I wrote that down as evidence that I am capable, even with my limitations. It's still hard to believe it sometimes, but I'm trying to focus on the positive.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful that you're actively looking for evidence to support your new beliefs. It takes practice to shift our thinking patterns, but every piece of evidence you gather helps to strengthen those new, more adaptive beliefs. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. \n\nFor today's agenda, I'd like to focus on reinforcing the skills you've learned, building your confidence in using them independently, and creating a plan for maintaining your progress after our sessions end. We can also discuss any challenges or concerns you have about ending therapy. What would you like to prioritize today?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I think I'd like to focus on building my confidence in using the skills on my own and creating a plan for after our sessions end. I'm feeling a bit nervous about not having this regular support, so I think that would be helpful.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, let's focus on building your confidence and creating a plan for after our sessions end. It's normal to feel nervous about this transition, but I'm confident that you have the tools and skills to continue making progress on your own. Let's start by reviewing the key skills and techniques you've learned throughout our sessions and discussing how you can continue to apply them in your daily life.",
