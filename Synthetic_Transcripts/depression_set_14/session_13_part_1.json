  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mariana, it's great to see you again for session 13. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and behavioral activation. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood. However, I've also had a few fibromyalgia flare-ups, which made it difficult to stay consistent with the homework.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've noticed some improvements in your mood, even if they're small. It's understandable that fibromyalgia flare-ups can make it challenging to stay consistent with the homework. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have ups and downs. Let's explore your experience with the homework a bit more. Can you share a specific example of when you used a thought record or engaged in behavioral activation?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I had a flare-up and had to miss a fitness class. I started feeling guilty and frustrated with myself, thinking that I'm weak and letting my classmates down. I tried to use a thought record to challenge those thoughts. I wrote down the evidence for and against the thought that I'm weak. The evidence against it included the fact that I'm managing a chronic illness and still showing up to classes when I can. I also reminded myself that my classmates have been understanding in the past.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of using a thought record to challenge negative thoughts. You did a good job of looking at the evidence for and against the thought and coming up with a more balanced perspective. How did you feel after completing the thought record?\n\nPatient: I felt a bit better, but the guilt and frustration didn't completely go away. It's hard to shake those feelings sometimes, even when I know logically that they're not entirely true.\n\nTherapist: It's normal for the emotions to linger even after challenging the thoughts. The goal isn't to eliminate the emotions completely but to lessen their intensity and make them more manageable. It's great that you noticed some improvement in how you felt after using the thought record. Now, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on?\n\nPatient: I'd like to continue working on challenging my negative thoughts, especially around expressing my needs and feeling like a burden. I also want to discuss how to manage my depression symptoms during fibromyalgia flare-ups, as that's been a significant challenge for me.\n\nTherapist: Those are important topics to focus on. We can definitely continue working on challenging negative thoughts related to expressing your needs and feeling like a burden. We can also explore strategies for managing depression symptoms during fibromyalgia flare-ups. Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main things I'd like to work on today.\n\nTherapist: Alright, so our agenda for today's session includes:\n1. Challenging negative thoughts related to expressing needs and feeling like a burden\n2. Strategies for managing depression symptoms during fibromyalgia flare-ups\n\nLet's start with the first topic. Can you share a recent situation where you struggled with expressing your needs or felt like a burden?",
