  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that comes to mind is when I had a fibromyalgia flare-up last week. I was in a lot of pain and struggled to keep up with my daily tasks. I knew I needed help, but I felt guilty asking Miguel to take on more responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Mariana. Let's explore this further using a thought record. Can you walk me through the situation and the thoughts and emotions you experienced?\n\nPatient: Well, it was last Wednesday morning. I woke up with a lot of pain and fatigue. I knew I had a lot to do that day, including grocery shopping and cleaning the house. My initial thought was, \"I can't ask Miguel to help me with these tasks. He already does so much, and I don't want to burden him further.\"\n\nTherapist: And what emotions did you feel along with that thought?\n\nPatient: I felt guilty, frustrated, and overwhelmed. I also felt like a failure for not being able to handle my responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: I can understand why you would feel that way. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I can't ask Miguel for help.\" What evidence supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, Miguel works long hours, and I know he's tired when he comes home. I don't want to add more to his plate. Also, I feel like I should be able to handle these tasks on my own, and asking for help means I'm not capable.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence goes against this thought?\n\nPatient: Miguel has told me multiple times that he's happy to help and that he wants me to ask for help when I need it. He's never complained or made me feel like a burden when I've asked for help in the past. Also, I know that on days when my pain is really bad, pushing myself to do everything makes my symptoms worse.\n\nTherapist: That's an important point, Mariana. It sounds like there's evidence that Miguel is willing to help and that asking for help can actually be beneficial for managing your symptoms. Based on this evidence, how could you reframe your initial thought?\n\nPatient: I suppose I could think, \"It's okay to ask Miguel for help when I'm having a flare-up. He cares about me and wants to support me. Asking for help doesn't mean I'm incapable; it means I'm taking care of myself.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Mariana! Asking for help is a sign of strength and self-awareness, not weakness. How do you feel when you consider this alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit relieved and less guilty. It's still hard to accept, but I can see how this perspective is more balanced and compassionate.\n\nTherapist: It takes practice to shift our thoughts and beliefs, but you're making great progress, Mariana. Let's continue to work on reframing these thoughts and finding a balance between independence and asking for help.",
