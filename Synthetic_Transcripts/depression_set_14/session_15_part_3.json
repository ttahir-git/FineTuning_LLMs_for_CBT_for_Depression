  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job identifying and reframing your thoughts around asking for help, Mariana. Let's continue to explore how this new perspective can impact your emotions and behaviors. When you think about asking Miguel for help during a flare-up, what emotions come up for you now?\n\nPatient: When I consider the alternative thought we discussed, I feel a bit less guilty and more at ease with the idea of asking for help. I still feel a bit uncomfortable, but I know it's the right thing to do for my well-being.\n\nTherapist: It's normal to still feel some discomfort, as changing long-held beliefs takes time and practice. I'm glad to hear that you're experiencing less guilt and more ease with the idea of asking for help. How do you think this shift in perspective might influence your behavior during a flare-up?\n\nPatient: I think I might be more likely to ask Miguel for help when I need it, rather than trying to push through the pain and do everything myself. I might also be more open to accepting help when he offers it, instead of automatically refusing.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant step forward, Mariana. Being more open to asking for and accepting help can make a big difference in managing your symptoms and overall well-being. Let's discuss how you can put this new perspective into action. Can you think of a specific situation where you might apply this new approach?\n\nPatient: I can think of a few situations, like when I need help with household chores or running errands during a flare-up. I could also ask Miguel for emotional support when I'm feeling overwhelmed or down.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples, Mariana. Let's break it down further. What might you say to Miguel in those situations, using your new perspective?\n\nPatient: Instead of saying, \"I'm fine, I can handle it,\" I could say something like, \"I'm having a tough day with my pain levels. Would you be able to help me with the laundry today?\" or \"I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now. Can we talk about what's on my mind?\"\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent ways to express your needs assertively and openly, Mariana. Using \"I\" statements and being specific about what you need can help you communicate more effectively with Miguel. How do you think he might respond to these requests?\n\nPatient: Based on past experiences, I think Miguel would be happy to help and supportive of my needs. He's always been understanding and caring, even when I've been hesitant to ask for help.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Mariana. It sounds like you have a strong support system in Miguel. Remembering his past responses can help you feel more confident in asking for help in the future. As you continue to practice this new approach, you may find that your guilt and discomfort decrease over time, and your relationship with Miguel strengthens as you communicate more openly about your needs.\n\nPatient: I agree. It's going to take some practice, but I feel more equipped to handle these situations now. Thank you for helping me work through this, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mariana. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to take small steps forward. Let's continue to explore how this new perspective can be applied to other situations in your life, and how it can help you manage your depression symptoms more effectively.",
