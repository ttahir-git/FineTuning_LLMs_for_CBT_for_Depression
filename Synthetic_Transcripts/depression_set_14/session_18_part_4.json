  "transcript": "Therapist: Setting boundaries is an essential skill for maintaining healthy relationships and prioritizing self-care. It involves communicating your needs and limits clearly and assertively, while also respecting the needs and boundaries of others. In the situation you described, it sounds like you were able to set a boundary with your professor by expressing your need for clarification and support.\n\nHow did setting this boundary impact your relationship with your professor and your feelings about the assignment?\n\nPatient: Setting that boundary with my professor actually strengthened our relationship. I felt more comfortable approaching him with questions and concerns after that, and he seemed to appreciate my honesty and willingness to advocate for myself. It also helped me feel more confident in my ability to complete the assignment, knowing that I had his support and understanding.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example of how setting boundaries can lead to more positive and supportive relationships, both with others and with ourselves. By communicating your needs assertively, you were able to access the support you needed and build trust with your professor. This can be empowering and help you feel more in control of your own well-being.\n\nAs you continue to practice setting boundaries, it can be helpful to remember that it's a skill that takes time and practice to develop. You may encounter situations where setting boundaries feels more challenging, such as with family members or close friends. In these cases, it can be helpful to plan ahead and practice what you want to say, focusing on using \"I\" statements and being clear and specific about your needs.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can think of a few relationships in my life where setting boundaries feels more difficult, like with my parents or my siblings. I often feel guilty for prioritizing my own needs over theirs, even when I know it's important for my well-being.\n\nTherapist: It's common to feel guilty or selfish when setting boundaries, especially with family members or close friends. This can be particularly challenging if you have a core belief that prioritizing your own needs is wrong or selfish. However, it's important to remember that setting boundaries is not about rejecting others or being selfish; it's about taking care of yourself so that you can show up more fully in your relationships and other areas of your life.\n\nOne way to reframe this guilt is to consider how setting boundaries can actually benefit your relationships in the long run. By taking care of your own needs and communicating them clearly, you're more likely to have the emotional energy and resilience to support others when they need it. You're also modeling healthy communication and self-care, which can inspire others to do the same.\n\nPatient: I hadn't thought about it that way before. It's true that when I'm taking care of myself, I'm better able to be there for others. And I would want my loved ones to prioritize their own well-being too.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care, you're not only taking care of yourself but also contributing to a culture of mutual support and understanding in your relationships. This can lead to more authentic and fulfilling connections with others.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, I'd like to take a moment to review the progress you've made and the skills you've learned throughout our work together. Over the past 18 sessions, you've developed a deeper understanding of the connections between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and how they contribute to your experiences of depression and anxiety. You've practiced challenging negative thoughts and beliefs using thought records and the Downward Arrow technique, and you've started to build a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself using the Positive Data Log.\n\nYou've also made progress in prioritizing self-care and setting boundaries, recognizing the importance of taking care of your own needs in order to show up more fully in your relationships and other areas of your life. While there have been challenges along the way, such as managing your depression symptoms during fibromyalgia flare-ups and communicating your needs to others, you've demonstrated resilience and a commitment to your own growth and well-being.\n\nAs we move towards the end of our sessions together, I encourage you to continue practicing these skills and techniques, and to be patient and compassionate with yourself as you navigate the ups and downs of life. Remember that progress is not always linear, and that setbacks and challenges are a normal part of the process.\n\nFor homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the Positive Data Log, focusing on gathering evidence that supports your new, more adaptive beliefs. I also encourage you to practice setting boundaries in at least one situation, paying attention to the impact on your emotional well-being and your relationships.\n\nDo you have any final thoughts or questions before we end today's session?\n\nPatient: I feel really grateful for the progress I've made in our sessions together. It hasn't always been easy, but I feel like I have a better understanding of myself and my depression, and more tools to manage my symptoms and prioritize my well-being. I know there will still be challenges ahead, but I feel more equipped to handle them now.\n\nThank you for all of your support and guidance throughout this process. I feel like I've learned a lot and grown a lot, and I'm excited to continue using these skills in my daily life.\n\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Mariana. It's been a pleasure working with you and witnessing your growth and progress. I have confidence in your ability to continue using these skills and techniques to support your well-being and build a more fulfilling life for yourself.\n\nRemember, the end of our sessions doesn't mean the end of your journey. Continue to be curious, compassionate, and patient with yourself as you navigate the challenges and triumphs of life. And don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it, whether that's from loved ones, a support group, or a mental health professional.\n\nI wish you all the best on your continued journey, Mariana. Take care.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Review of progress and skills learned throughout therapy, including thought records, Downward Arrow technique, Positive Data Log, self-care, and setting boundaries; discussion of the benefits and challenges of setting boundaries in relationships; reflection on the patient's growth and progress over the course of therapy.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Continuing to identify and reframe negative thoughts related to core belief of not being good enough.
