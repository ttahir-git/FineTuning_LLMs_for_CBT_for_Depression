  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mariana, it's great to see you again for session 12. Before we begin, I want to remind you that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the thought records and express my needs more, but it's still challenging. I did have a conversation with Miguel about helping me with some household tasks, and he was very understanding. However, I still feel guilty for asking for help.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we discussed and that you had a positive conversation with Miguel. Feeling guilty for asking for help is a common challenge, and it's something we can continue to work on together. Can you tell me more about your experiences with the thought records and expressing your needs since our last session?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to catch my negative thoughts and challenge them using the thought records. It's helpful to see the evidence for and against my thoughts written down. However, I still find it hard to express my needs, especially when it comes to my studies and managing my chronic pain. I feel like I should be able to handle everything on my own.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful that you're finding the thought records helpful in challenging your negative thoughts. Regarding expressing your needs, it's understandable that you find it difficult, especially given your core belief about independence and strength. Remember that asking for help is not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of self-awareness and courage. What do you think about setting an agenda for today's session that focuses on continuing to practice expressing your needs and challenging your core belief?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I think I need more practice with expressing my needs, and I want to work on changing my core belief about independence and strength.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's add those topics to our agenda. We can also review your experience with the homework in more detail and discuss any successes or challenges you encountered. Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda for today's session?\n\nPatient: I've been feeling more fatigued lately due to my fibromyalgia, and it's been affecting my mood. I'd like to talk about how to manage my depression symptoms when my chronic pain is worse.\n\nTherapist: That's an important topic, and I'm glad you brought it up. We can definitely discuss strategies for managing your depression symptoms in the context of your chronic pain. So, our agenda for today includes reviewing your homework, practicing expressing needs, challenging your core belief about independence and strength, and discussing how to manage depression symptoms when your chronic pain is worse. Does that sound good to you?",
