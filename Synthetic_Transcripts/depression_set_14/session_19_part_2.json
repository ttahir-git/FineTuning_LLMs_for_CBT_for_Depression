  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing the key skills and techniques you've learned throughout our sessions. Can you tell me which ones have been the most helpful for you?\n\nPatient: I think the thought records have been really helpful in identifying and challenging my negative thoughts. I've also found the self-care plan and behavioral activation to be important in managing my depression symptoms, especially during fibromyalgia flare-ups.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear. Those are all important skills that you can continue to use even after our sessions end. Remember, the goal of therapy is for you to become your own therapist, and you've already made significant progress in that direction. Let's discuss how you can build your confidence in using these skills independently.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of being my own therapist, but sometimes I worry that I won't be able to do it without your guidance. How can I build my confidence?\n\nTherapist: One way to build confidence is to practice applying the skills in different situations and reflecting on your successes. For example, you mentioned setting boundaries with your sister. That took courage and assertiveness, which are key components of being your own therapist. Another way is to create a personalized 'toolbox' of CBT skills and strategies that you can refer to when needed.\n\nPatient: I like the idea of a toolbox. What would that look like?\n\nTherapist: Your toolbox can include a list of the skills you've learned, such as thought records, self-care activities, and boundary-setting techniques. You can also include coping statements or affirmations that remind you of your strengths and abilities. For example, you might write, \"I am capable of managing my thoughts and emotions\" or \"It's okay to prioritize my needs and set boundaries.\"\n\nPatient: That makes sense. I can keep a notebook or a note on my phone with these tools and reminders.\n\nTherapist: Exactly! Having a physical or digital reminder can be really helpful. Another way to build confidence is to practice problem-solving future challenges using CBT techniques. Let's imagine a scenario where you might struggle with negative thoughts or emotions. How could you apply the skills you've learned?\n\nPatient: Let's say I have another fibromyalgia flare-up and start feeling really down about myself. I could use a thought record to identify and challenge any negative thoughts, like \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I should be able to handle this better.\" I could also refer to my self-care plan and make sure I'm taking time to rest and engage in activities that bring me joy or relaxation.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent example of how you can apply your CBT skills in a challenging situation. Remember, it's not about being perfect or avoiding setbacks altogether. It's about having the tools and the resilience to cope with challenges as they arise.",
