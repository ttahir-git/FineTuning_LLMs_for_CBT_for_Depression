  "transcript": "Patient: When my fibromyalgia flare-ups are really bad, I find it hard to do anything, even getting out of bed feels like a struggle. I feel frustrated and hopeless, like I'm never going to get better. I start thinking that I'm a burden on Miguel and that I'm not pulling my weight in our relationship.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that your fibromyalgia flare-ups can trigger feelings of frustration and hopelessness, as well as negative thoughts about yourself and your relationship. Let's explore the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors during these times. Can you give me an example of a specific situation where you experienced these thoughts and feelings?\n\nPatient: Last week, I had a really bad flare-up that lasted for several days. I couldn't go to my classes or do any of my usual activities. I spent most of the time in bed, feeling miserable. I kept thinking, \"I'm never going to get better\" and \"Miguel deserves someone who can actually contribute to the relationship.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Mariana. I can see how those thoughts would lead to feelings of frustration and hopelessness. Let's look at how these thoughts might be influencing your behaviors. When you're having these thoughts and feelings, what do you typically do?\n\nPatient: When I'm feeling like that, I tend to withdraw from Miguel and spend a lot of time alone in bed. I don't want to burden him with my problems, so I try to deal with it on my own. But that usually just makes me feel worse.\n\nTherapist: It's common for people to withdraw when they're feeling depressed or hopeless, but as you've noticed, that can sometimes make the situation worse. Let's try to challenge some of those negative thoughts using the evidence for and against technique. What evidence do you have that supports the thought \"I'm never going to get better\"?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been dealing with fibromyalgia for a long time, and it seems like the flare-ups are getting worse, not better. I've tried a lot of different treatments, but nothing seems to work for very long.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so that's some evidence for the thought. Now let's look at the evidence against the thought. Have there been times when you've had some relief from your symptoms, even if it was temporary?\n\nPatient: Yes, there have been times when my symptoms were more manageable, and I was able to do more of the things I enjoy. And I know that even though the treatments don't always work as well as I'd like, they do help sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's important evidence against the thought that you're never going to get better. It shows that there are times when your symptoms are more manageable, and that treatments can help, even if they're not a complete cure. Let's look at the other thought, \"Miguel deserves someone who can actually contribute to the relationship.\" What evidence do you have for and against that thought?\n\nPatient: For the thought, I guess I feel like I'm not contributing as much to the relationship as I should be, especially when I'm having a flare-up. I can't do as much around the house or be as active as I'd like to be. But against the thought, I know that Miguel loves me and wants to support me, even when I'm struggling. He's never made me feel like I'm a burden or that he wants someone else.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Mariana. It's important to recognize that Miguel's feelings and actions are not necessarily the same as your thoughts. Just because you feel like a burden doesn't mean that Miguel sees you that way. Based on the evidence for and against these thoughts, how could you reframe them in a more balanced way?\n\nPatient: I guess I could say something like, \"Even though my fibromyalgia is a chronic condition, there are times when my symptoms are more manageable, and treatments can help. And even though I sometimes feel like a burden to Miguel, he has shown me through his words and actions that he loves me and wants to support me, even when I'm struggling.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great reframe, Mariana. It acknowledges the challenges you're facing while also recognizing the evidence that contradicts your negative thoughts. When you're having a flare-up and starting to feel frustrated and hopeless, try to remind yourself of this reframe. It can help you challenge those negative thoughts and feelings, and maybe even change your behavior, like reaching out to Miguel for support instead of withdrawing.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. It's hard to remember to challenge my thoughts when I'm feeling really bad, but I think practicing this reframe could help.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, it takes practice to change our thought patterns, but over time it can make a big difference in how we feel and behave. Another technique that can be helpful is behavioral activation. When you're feeling depressed or hopeless, it can be tempting to withdraw and avoid activities, but that can actually make the feelings worse. Behavioral activation involves intentionally engaging in activities that give you a sense of pleasure or accomplishment, even if you don't feel like doing them at first. Can you think of some activities that might help you feel better during a flare-up?\n\nPatient: I know that gentle exercise, like going for a short walk or doing some stretching, can sometimes help with my pain and mood. And I usually feel better when I spend time with Miguel or talk to a friend, even if it's just a short conversation.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples of behavioral activation. Even small activities like taking a short walk or having a brief conversation can help shift your mood and give you a sense of accomplishment. The key is to start small and be consistent, even if you don't feel like doing the activity at first. As you practice these techniques, you may find that it becomes easier to challenge your negative thoughts and engage in more positive behaviors over time.",
