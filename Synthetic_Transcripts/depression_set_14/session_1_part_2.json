  "transcript": "Patient: My studies have always been important to me. I'm currently enrolled in a veterinary technology program, which I'm passionate about, but it's been challenging to keep up with the coursework and attend classes regularly. The fibromyalgia causes me a lot of pain and fatigue, which makes it hard to focus and retain information. I often feel like I'm falling behind, and that just adds to my stress and feelings of inadequacy.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like your studies are a significant source of both fulfillment and stress in your life, Mariana. The physical symptoms of fibromyalgia, such as pain and fatigue, can certainly make it difficult to keep up with the demands of your program. I can understand how this might contribute to feelings of stress and inadequacy. \n\nI'm curious about the thoughts and feelings that arise when you're struggling to keep up with your studies. Can you share a bit more about what goes through your mind during those moments?\n\nPatient: When I'm struggling with my studies, I often feel like I'm not good enough or that I'm letting everyone down. I think about how hard I've worked to get to this point and how I don't want to disappoint my family or myself. I also worry that my classmates and professors might think I'm lazy or not dedicated enough because I miss classes or struggle with the material.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mariana. It seems like you put a lot of pressure on yourself to succeed and meet the expectations of others. These thoughts about not being good enough or disappointing others can be very distressing and may contribute to your feelings of depression.\n\nI'd like to explore this further. When you have these thoughts, how do they impact your behavior and your motivation to continue with your studies?\n\nPatient: When I'm stuck in those negative thought patterns, I sometimes feel like giving up. I think, \"What's the point of trying if I'm just going to fail anyway?\" It's hard to find the motivation to keep going when I'm in that mindset. I might procrastinate on assignments or avoid going to class because I'm afraid of facing my professors and classmates.\n\nTherapist: It's common for negative thoughts to impact our behavior and motivation in that way. When we're stuck in a cycle of self-doubt and fear of failure, it can be challenging to take the necessary steps to move forward.\n\nGiven what you've shared about your family background and the high expectations you've experienced, I wonder if these negative thoughts have been present for a long time or if they've intensified since your fibromyalgia diagnosis?\n\nPatient: I've always been a bit of a perfectionist, but I think the fibromyalgia diagnosis definitely made things worse. Before the diagnosis, I was able to push through and meet my own high standards, even if it was stressful. But now, with the physical limitations and the pain, I feel like I'm constantly falling short of my own expectations and the expectations I perceive from others.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense, Mariana. A chronic illness like fibromyalgia can significantly impact one's sense of identity and self-worth, especially when it interferes with the ability to meet long-held standards and expectations.\n\nI appreciate you sharing about your perfectionistic tendencies. Perfectionism can be a double-edged sword \u2013 it can drive us to achieve great things, but it can also lead to self-criticism and feelings of inadequacy when we inevitably fall short of perfection.\n\nAs we continue our work together, we'll explore how these patterns of thinking and the pressure to meet expectations might be contributing to your depression. We'll also work on developing more compassionate and realistic ways of relating to yourself and your circumstances.\n\nHow do you feel about what we've discussed so far? Does anything resonate with you or bring up additional thoughts or questions?",
