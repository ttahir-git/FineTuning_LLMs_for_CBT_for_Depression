  "transcript": "Patient: Thank you for explaining all of that, Nova. I feel like I have a better understanding of how my thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are connected, and how I can start to change them.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mariana. I'm glad you're finding these concepts helpful. Remember, it's a process, and it takes practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\nPatient: I will try to do that. It's just hard sometimes when I'm in the middle of a tough situation.\n\nTherapist: That's completely understandable. That's why we're practicing these skills now, so you can have them in your toolbox when you need them. And remember, you don't have to do it alone. You have your support system, and you have me.\n\nPatient: That's true. I'm grateful for the support I have, even if it's hard to lean on sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Leaning on others can be challenging, but it's an important part of taking care of yourself. It shows strength and self-compassion.\n\nPatient: I never thought of it that way before. I always saw it as a weakness.\n\nTherapist: That's a common belief, but it's not accurate. Asking for help and accepting support takes courage and shows that you value yourself enough to prioritize your well-being.\n\nPatient: I like that perspective. It makes it feel a little easier to reach out when I need to.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad that reframing is helpful for you, Mariana. As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling and if there's anything else you'd like to discuss before we end.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a little better than when we started. I still have a lot of emotions swirling around, but I feel like I have some new tools to work with.\n\nTherapist: That's great, Mariana. Remember, it's okay to have a range of emotions, and it's normal for progress to feel slow sometimes. The important thing is that you're taking steps forward and building awareness and skills.\n\nPatient: Thank you for reminding me of that. I don't think there's anything else I need to talk about today. What should I focus on for homework this week?\n\nTherapist: For homework, I'd like you to continue practicing the mindfulness and progressive muscle relaxation techniques we've been working on. Try to do a little bit each day, even if it's just for a few minutes. I also want you to keep using the thought records to track and challenge negative thoughts, especially those related to guilt and inadequacy. Finally, I'd like you to schedule at least one pleasant activity each day, even if it's something small like taking a short walk or calling a friend.\n\nPatient: Okay, I can do that. I'll try to be consistent with the practices and the thought records.\n\nTherapist: Remember, it's not about being perfect. It's about making an effort and being kind to yourself in the process. If you have any questions or challenges come up during the week, feel free to bring them to our next session.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you, Nova.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mariana. I'm proud of the work you're doing. Let's plan to meet again next week at the same time. In the meantime, take care of yourself and remember to reach out for support when you need it.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you again. I'll see you next week.\n\nTherapist: I look forward to it, Mariana. Have a good week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Reviewed and practiced mindfulness, progressive muscle relaxation, and thought records; explored feelings of guilt and inadequacy and their impact on thoughts and behaviors; discussed the CBT triangle and how to use it to make changes; emphasized the importance of asking for help and leaning on support systems.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Mindfulness (focused on mindful breathing), progressive muscle relaxation, thought records, and the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique.
