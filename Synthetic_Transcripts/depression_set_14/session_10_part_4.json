  "transcript": "Patient: One situation that comes to mind is when Miguel asked me how my day was, and I just said it was fine, even though I was in a lot of pain and feeling really down. I didn't want to burden him with my problems, but later that evening, I snapped at him over something small because I was so frustrated and overwhelmed.\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Mariana. It's common for people to struggle with expressing their needs, especially when they're concerned about burdening others. Let's explore this further. What thoughts were going through your mind when Miguel asked about your day?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"He doesn't need to hear about my pain and problems. He's had a long day at work, and I don't want to add to his stress.\" I also thought, \"I should be able to handle this on my own. I don't want him to think I'm weak or complaining all the time.\"\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts reveal some deeply held beliefs about what it means to express your needs and how you think others perceive you when you do. Let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts, just like we did earlier. What evidence do you have that Miguel doesn't want to hear about your pain and problems?\n\nPatient: Well, he's never actually said that he doesn't want to hear about it. In fact, he often asks how I'm feeling and if there's anything he can do to help. But I still feel like I'm burdening him.\n\nTherapist: That's an important distinction, Mariana. The evidence seems to suggest that Miguel does want to support you, even if your feelings tell you otherwise. Now, what about the thought that you should be able to handle this on your own? What evidence do you have for and against that thought?\n\nPatient: The evidence for that thought is that I've always been independent and prided myself on being strong. But the evidence against it is that I'm dealing with a chronic illness, and it's okay to need help sometimes. I guess I'm just not used to asking for it.\n\nTherapist: You've identified a core belief there, Mariana - the idea that you should be independent and strong, and that needing help is a sign of weakness. Let's explore that belief further. Where do you think it comes from, and how has it influenced your thoughts and behaviors?\n\nPatient: I think it comes from my upbringing. My parents always emphasized the importance of being self-reliant and not burdening others with your problems. I've carried that belief with me into adulthood, and it's made it hard for me to ask for help, even when I really need it.\n\nTherapist: That makes a lot of sense, Mariana. Our early experiences and messages we receive from family and culture can have a profound impact on our beliefs and how we view ourselves and the world. The belief that you should be independent and strong has likely served you well in many areas of your life, but it may also be contributing to your difficulty in expressing your needs and accepting support from others.\n\nPatient: I can see that now. It's like I have this voice in my head telling me I should be able to handle everything on my own, even when that's not realistic or healthy.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. That voice is your core belief talking, and it's influencing your thoughts and behaviors in ways that may not always be helpful. One way to start challenging that belief is to gather evidence against it - to look for examples of times when asking for help or expressing your needs led to positive outcomes.\n\nPatient: I can think of a few times when I did ask for help, and it turned out okay. Like when I asked my fitness group for accommodations during class, and they were really understanding and supportive. Or when I told my professor about my chronic pain, and she worked with me to adjust my deadlines.\n\nTherapist: Those are great examples, Mariana. They show that expressing your needs and accepting help can lead to positive outcomes and make your life more manageable. As we continue to work together, we can practice challenging that core belief and developing a more balanced perspective on independence and asking for help.\n\nPatient: That sounds really helpful. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to try.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Mariana. Remember, challenging core beliefs is a process, and it takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.\n\nAs we wrap up today's session, let's review what we've discussed and set some homework for the next week. We explored your feelings of guilt and inadequacy related to your chronic pain and how they impact your thoughts and behaviors. We practiced reframing those thoughts using thought records and discussed strategies for managing your pain and emotions, like activity pacing.\n\nWe also talked about the importance of expressing your needs and how your core belief about independence and strength can make that challenging. For homework, I'd like you to practice activity pacing with grocery shopping and other tasks, and pay attention to how it impacts your pain and emotions.\n\nI also encourage you to practice expressing your needs to Miguel and others in small ways, and to look for evidence that challenges your core belief about independence. We can discuss your experiences with both of these exercises in our next session.\n\nHow are you feeling about what we've covered today, and do you have any final thoughts or questions?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling more hopeful and empowered after today's session. I know I have a lot of work to do, but I feel like I have some tools and strategies to start making changes. I'm a little nervous about expressing my needs more, but I know it's important, and I'm willing to try.\n\nTherapist: It's normal to feel nervous about making changes, Mariana. Remember to start small and be patient with yourself. I'm confident that with practice, you'll start to see positive changes in your thoughts, emotions, and relationships.\n\nBefore we end, let's do a quick check-in on your mood. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your mood right now?\n\nPatient: I'd say I'm at a 6. I'm still in some pain, but I feel more hopeful and supported than I did at the beginning of the session.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Mariana. It's normal for your mood to fluctuate, especially when dealing with chronic pain. The important thing is that you're developing tools and strategies to manage those fluctuations and take care of yourself.\n\nThank you for your hard work today, Mariana. I look forward to hearing about your experiences with the homework and continuing our work together in the next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Managing thoughts and emotions related to chronic pain, exploring feelings of guilt and inadequacy, discussing strategies for managing pain and emotions (activity pacing), improving communication skills and expressing needs, identifying and challenging core beliefs about independence and strength.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Thought records, cognitive restructuring (reframing thoughts), activity pacing, exploring evidence for and against thoughts and beliefs, identifying and challenging core beliefs. Plans for the future include continuing to build on these techniques and introducing new ones as needed, such as cognitive and behavioral experiments and addressing specific depressive symptoms.\n- Homework assigned: Practice activity pacing with grocery shopping and other tasks, pay attention to how it impacts pain and emotions, practice expressing needs to Miguel and others in small ways, look for evidence that challenges core belief about independence.\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details: Mariana is making progress in identifying and challenging negative thoughts and beliefs but still struggles with feelings of guilt and inadequacy, especially related to her chronic pain and ability to keep up with responsibilities. She finds it difficult to express her needs and accept help from others due to a core belief about independence and strength.\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs: Mariana identified a core belief that she should be independent and strong and that needing help is a sign of weakness.

Continue practicing thought records, cognitive restructuring, activity pacing, and expressing needs. Explore Mariana's core belief further and discuss strategies for challenging it and developing a more balanced perspective.",
