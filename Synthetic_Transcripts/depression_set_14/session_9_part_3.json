  "transcript": "Patient: Let's focus on the thought, \"I should be able to handle this better.\" I feel like I'm not doing enough to manage my pain and emotions, and I should be stronger.\n\nTherapist: Alright, let's explore that thought. When you say, \"I should be able to handle this better,\" what do you mean by \"handle\" and \"better\"?\n\nPatient: I guess I mean that I should be able to push through the pain and still do the things I need to do, like my schoolwork and household responsibilities. I feel like I'm not trying hard enough.\n\nTherapist: It's common to have those feelings, but I want to point out that \"should\" statements can be a form of cognitive distortion. They often involve putting unrealistic expectations on ourselves. Let's consider the evidence for and against this thought. What evidence do you have that you're not trying hard enough?\n\nPatient: Well, I haven't been able to keep up with my schoolwork as much as I'd like, and I often rely on Miguel to help with household tasks. I feel like I should be able to do more.\n\nTherapist: I understand that it can be frustrating when you're not able to do as much as you'd like. However, I wonder if we're overlooking the efforts you are making. What evidence do we have that you are trying to manage your pain and responsibilities?\n\nPatient: I guess I have been going to my classes, even when it's difficult. And I've been trying to use the pacing technique we discussed to balance my activities and rest. It's just hard to see my own progress sometimes.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point. It's often easier to notice what we're not doing than what we are doing. The fact that you're attending classes and using pacing techniques is evidence that you are putting in effort to manage your pain and responsibilities. Let's try to reframe this thought in a more balanced way. What's an alternative thought that acknowledges your efforts while also recognizing the real challenges you face?\n\nPatient: I suppose a more balanced thought could be, \"I'm doing my best to manage my pain and responsibilities, even though it's difficult. It's okay to need help sometimes, and I'm still making progress, even if it's not as fast as I'd like.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought! It acknowledges the reality of your situation while also giving yourself credit for the efforts you are making. How does that thought feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It feels more compassionate and realistic. The original thought just made me feel worse about myself, but this one reminds me that I'm doing what I can, even if it's not perfect.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. Reframing our thoughts in a more balanced way can have a big impact on our emotions and overall well-being. I'm glad we were able to explore this together. How do you feel about practicing this reframing technique on your own, perhaps with some of the other thoughts we discussed earlier?\n\nPatient: I think I could try it. It's helpful to have a specific example to work from. I'll try to catch myself when I'm having those \"should\" thoughts and see if I can find a more balanced perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. Remember, it takes practice, and it's okay if you don't always catch those thoughts in the moment. The more you practice, the easier it will become. Let's move on to our next agenda item, which is adapting the techniques we've discussed to make them more manageable on difficult days. Do you have any thoughts on how we might approach this?",
