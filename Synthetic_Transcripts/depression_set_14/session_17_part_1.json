  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mariana, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and the Downward Arrow technique. It's been challenging, but I've noticed some small improvements in my mood and how I react to certain situations. However, I've also had a few tough days where my fibromyalgia flared up, and it was hard to focus on anything else.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and noticing some improvements, even if they're small. It's also important to acknowledge the challenges you've faced, especially with your fibromyalgia flares. How have those tough days impacted your mood and thoughts?\n\nPatient: On the days when my fibromyalgia is really bad, I find it hard to think positively or even remember to use the techniques we've discussed. I get stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts, like \"I'm never going to get better\" or \"I'm a burden to everyone around me.\" It's difficult to break out of that mindset when I'm in so much pain.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience for many people dealing with chronic pain and depression. It's understandable that it's harder to focus on positive thoughts or use coping techniques when you're in the midst of a flare-up. Let's make a note to discuss some strategies for managing those particularly challenging days as part of our agenda for today. Speaking of which, what else would you like to prioritize in our session today?\n\nPatient: I'd like to continue working on challenging my core belief of not being good enough. Even though I've made some progress, I still find myself falling into that pattern of thinking quite often. I'd also like to discuss how I can better communicate my needs to Miguel and my family, especially when I'm having a bad day with my fibromyalgia.\n\nTherapist: Those are both important topics to address. Let's add them to our agenda. We can start by reviewing your experience with the homework and the techniques we've been practicing, then move on to discussing strategies for challenging your core belief and improving communication with your loved ones. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good to me. I'm ready to get started.",
