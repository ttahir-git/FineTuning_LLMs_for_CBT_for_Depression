  "transcript": "Patient: When you put it that way, I guess I don't have concrete evidence that Miguel sees me as a burden. He's always telling me not to worry about it and that he's happy to support me. But I still feel guilty for not being able to do as much as I used to.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Mariana. It's common for our feelings to not always match up with the objective evidence. And it's understandable to feel guilt around changes in your abilities and roles. Perhaps we can explore that further as one of our therapy goals - finding ways to navigate those changes and communicate with Miguel about your needs and feelings.\n\nPatient: That would be a good goal. I do want to find better ways to talk to Miguel about this. I know he wants to support me, but I don't want to overwhelm him either.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, improving communication with loved ones is a great therapy goal. We can work on building those skills and finding that balance between accepting support and maintaining your independence as much as possible.\n\nAnother important aspect of CBT is setting homework between sessions to practice the skills we discuss. Homework might include things like continuing to keep thought records, practicing reframing negative thoughts, or trying out new communication strategies with Miguel.\n\nPatient: Homework makes sense. I know I'll need to practice these things outside of our sessions for them to really sink in. I'm willing to put in the work.\n\nTherapist: That's great to hear, Mariana. Your motivation and willingness to engage in the process will be key to making progress. As we continue to discuss your goals and develop a treatment plan, we'll tailor the homework assignments to your specific needs and priorities.\n\nI'm curious, how are you feeling about the CBT concepts we've discussed so far? Does the focus on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors resonate with your experiences?",
