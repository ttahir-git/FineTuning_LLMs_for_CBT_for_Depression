  "transcript": "Therapist: As we wrap up our session today, I want to acknowledge the great work you've done in exploring your thoughts and feelings, Mariana. You've made some important insights and have shown a willingness to try new techniques to manage your depression and chronic pain.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a challenging session, but I feel like I've made some progress. I'm looking forward to trying out the activity pacing technique and continuing to work on challenging my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Mariana. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you continue this journey.\n\nBefore we end our session, let's discuss your homework for the week. I'd like you to continue practicing the mindfulness and progressive muscle relaxation techniques we've covered in previous sessions. Additionally, try to apply the activity pacing technique to your study sessions, breaking them down into smaller, more manageable tasks with scheduled breaks. Use thought records to challenge any negative thoughts that arise during this process.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'll do my best to practice these techniques and complete the thought records.\n\nTherapist: Great. Also, I'd like you to schedule at least one pleasant activity each day, even if it's something small like taking a short walk or calling a friend. Engaging in enjoyable activities can help improve your mood and give you a sense of accomplishment.\n\nPatient: I'll try to do that. It's sometimes hard to find the motivation, but I know it's important.\n\nTherapist: I understand. Start small and be kind to yourself. Remember, every little bit counts.\n\nDo you have any final thoughts or questions before we end our session today?\n\nPatient: No, I think we've covered a lot, and I have a good understanding of what I need to work on.\n\nTherapist: Alright, Mariana. I'm here to support you, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care of yourself, and remember to reach out if you need any additional support between sessions.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your help and support. Have a good week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Explored feelings of guilt and inadequacy related to chronic pain and difficulty keeping up with responsibilities; introduced and discussed activity pacing technique for managing chronic pain and emotions; reviewed thought records and challenging negative thoughts; emphasized the importance of self-compassion and setting realistic goals.\n- Techniques or exercises used: Thought records, activity pacing, mindfulness, progressive muscle relaxation.
