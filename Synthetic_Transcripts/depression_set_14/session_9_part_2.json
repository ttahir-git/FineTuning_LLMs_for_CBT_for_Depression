  "transcript": "Patient: When my pain is severe, I often feel like I'm trapped in my own body. I get frustrated and angry with myself for not being able to do the things I want or need to do. It's like I'm watching my life pass me by, and I can't do anything about it.\n\nTherapist: That sounds incredibly difficult and overwhelming. It's understandable to feel frustrated and angry when your pain limits your ability to engage in activities that are important to you. Let's explore this further. When you're in that state of frustration and anger, what thoughts tend to go through your mind?\n\nPatient: I think things like, \"I'm never going to be able to do the things I love again,\" \"I'm just a burden to everyone around me,\" and \"I should be able to handle this better.\" It's hard to see past those thoughts when I'm in that much pain.\n\nTherapist: Those thoughts sound very distressing, and it's clear that they contribute to your emotional distress. I want to acknowledge that your pain is real and valid, and it's not your fault that you're experiencing these limitations. At the same time, I wonder if we could examine these thoughts more closely. Do you think any of them might be examples of cognitive distortions, like we've discussed before?\n\nPatient: I guess there might be some catastrophizing, like when I think, \"I'm never going to be able to do the things I love again.\" And maybe some \"should\" statements, like \"I should be able to handle this better.\" It's hard to recognize them in the moment, though.\n\nTherapist: You're right, it can be challenging to identify cognitive distortions in the heat of the moment, especially when you're dealing with intense physical pain. The fact that you're able to recognize them now is a great sign of progress. Let's take a closer look at one of these thoughts and see if we can find a more balanced perspective. Which thought would you like to focus on?",
