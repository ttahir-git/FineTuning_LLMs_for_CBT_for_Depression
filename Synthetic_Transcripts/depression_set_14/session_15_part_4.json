  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some great progress today, Mariana. I'm curious to know how you're feeling about our session and the work we've done together.\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also hopeful. It's not easy to challenge these long-held beliefs, but I can see how it's necessary for my well-being. I appreciate your guidance and support, Nova.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel tired after doing this kind of emotional work. I'm glad you're also feeling hopeful, as that can be a powerful motivator for change. Remember to take care of yourself after our sessions, and engage in activities that help you recharge and relax.\n\nPatient: I will, thank you for the reminder. I think I'll take a warm bath and read a book tonight.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a wonderful self-care plan, Mariana. Before we wrap up, let's discuss your homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought records, focusing on situations where your core belief about needing help comes up. Try to reframe those thoughts using the evidence we discussed today, and practice expressing your needs assertively with Miguel and others in your life. Additionally, keep track of your mood and any successes or challenges you experience with these tasks. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds manageable. I'll do my best to practice these techniques and be more mindful of my thoughts and behaviors.\n\nTherapist: Great, I have confidence in your ability to make progress, Mariana. Remember, it's okay to take small steps and be patient with yourself. We'll review your experiences and any challenges in our next session. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and encouragement. I'll see you next week.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mariana. Take care, and I look forward to our next session.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Reframing core belief about needing help, assertive communication, managing depression symptoms during fibromyalgia flare-ups, self-care, and emotional well-being.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Continuing to identify and reframe negative thoughts related to needing help and expressing needs.
