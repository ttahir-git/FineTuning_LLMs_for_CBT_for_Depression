  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your homework. You mentioned that you tried to practice activity pacing with grocery shopping and expressing your needs to Miguel. Can you tell me more about your experience with each of these tasks?\n\nPatient: With the grocery shopping, I tried to break it down into smaller tasks and take breaks, but I still found myself pushing through the pain. I felt like I should be able to do it without any problems, and I didn't want to bother Miguel by asking for help.\n\nTherapist: It's common to have these thoughts, especially when you're first starting to practice activity pacing. Remember that the goal is to find a balance between activity and rest, and it's okay to ask for help when needed. What emotions did you experience during and after the grocery shopping?\n\nPatient: I felt frustrated and disappointed in myself. I also felt anxious about not being able to keep up with my responsibilities.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mariana. It's important to acknowledge and validate your emotions. Let's look at the thoughts that contributed to these feelings. Can you identify any specific thoughts you had during the grocery shopping?\n\nPatient: I kept thinking, \"I should be able to do this on my own\" and \"If I can't even do grocery shopping, how will I manage everything else?\"\n\nTherapist: These thoughts seem to be connected to your core belief about independence and strength. Let's explore this further. What do you think these thoughts say about your underlying beliefs?\n\nPatient: I guess they show that I believe I should be able to handle everything on my own, and that needing help means I'm weak or incapable.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Mariana. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you should be able to do everything on your own?\n\nPatient: Well, I've always been independent and prided myself on being able to handle things without help. I feel like I should be able to keep doing that, even with my chronic pain.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have that challenges this idea?\n\nPatient: I know that my chronic pain makes it harder for me to do certain tasks, and that it's okay to ask for help sometimes. My friends and family have told me that they're happy to help, and that it doesn't mean I'm weak.\n\nTherapist: That's an important perspective to consider. Now, let's try to reframe your original thought in a more balanced way. What's an alternative thought that takes into account both the evidence for and against your original thought?\n\nPatient: I guess an alternative thought could be, \"It's okay to ask for help with grocery shopping when I need it. It doesn't mean I'm weak or incapable, it just means I'm taking care of myself and my chronic pain.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great alternative thought, Mariana. How does thinking this way change your emotions?\n\nPatient: When I think about it that way, I feel less frustrated and disappointed in myself. I also feel a bit more at ease about asking for help.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear. This is a great example of how challenging our thoughts and beliefs can lead to changes in our emotions and behaviors. Let's practice this again with your experience of expressing your needs to Miguel. Can you tell me more about that situation?",
