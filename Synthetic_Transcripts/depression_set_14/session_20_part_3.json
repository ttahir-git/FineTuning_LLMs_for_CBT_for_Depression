  "transcript": "Therapist: You've made some excellent points about your support system and self-care. Let's explore these a bit further. Can you tell me more about how your fitness group and the animals at the shelter support your mental health?\n\nPatient: My fitness group has been a great source of encouragement. They understand my limitations due to fibromyalgia and always cheer me on, even if I can't keep up with everyone else. It helps me feel less alone in my struggles. And the animals at the shelter \u2013 they bring me so much joy. When I'm taking care of them, I feel a sense of purpose and connection.\n\nTherapist: It's wonderful that you have these supportive elements in your life. Connecting with others who understand your experiences and engaging in meaningful activities are both powerful ways to maintain your mental well-being. Let's discuss how you can prioritize these supports as part of your ongoing self-care plan.\n\nPatient: I think I need to make a conscious effort to reach out to my fitness group more regularly, even if I'm not up for a workout. Just staying in touch and sharing our experiences can be helpful. And I want to make sure I'm setting aside time each week to volunteer at the shelter. It's easy to let that slide when I'm feeling down, but I know it always lifts my spirits.\n\nTherapist: Those sound like great strategies for prioritizing your support system and self-care. Remember, self-care isn't just about bubble baths and treats \u2013 it's about engaging in activities that nourish your mind, body, and soul. Your fitness group and the animals at the shelter are clearly important parts of that.\n\nPatient: You're right. It's about doing things that truly support my well-being, not just quick fixes. I need to keep that in mind.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. And as you continue to prioritize these supportive elements in your life, you'll likely find that your resilience grows. You've already shown so much strength and adaptability throughout our work together.\n\nPatient: Thank you. I do feel stronger than I did when I first started therapy. It's been a challenging journey, but I've learned so much about myself and my abilities.\n\nTherapist: You've made incredible progress, Mariana. I have full confidence in your ability to continue using the skills you've learned and to navigate any challenges that come your way. Remember, setbacks are a normal part of the process \u2013 they don't erase all the hard work you've done.",
