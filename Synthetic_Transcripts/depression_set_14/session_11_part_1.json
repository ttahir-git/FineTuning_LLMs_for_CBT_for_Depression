  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mariana, it's great to see you again for session 11. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever feel that you're in crisis, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted individual in your life. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues, so please feel free to express your thoughts and feelings openly.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate the support you've provided me so far.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mariana. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or notable experiences you'd like to share?\n\nPatient: It's been a challenging week. I tried to practice the activity pacing with grocery shopping, but I still found myself pushing through the pain and feeling exhausted afterward. I also attempted to express my needs to Miguel, but I struggled to find the right words and ended up feeling frustrated with myself.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable that making these changes can be difficult, and it's okay to have setbacks. The important thing is that you're making an effort to apply the techniques we've discussed. Let's explore your experiences further. What thoughts and emotions came up for you during the grocery shopping and when trying to express your needs to Miguel?\n\nPatient: During the grocery shopping, I kept thinking that I should be able to do this simple task without any problems. I felt disappointed in myself for not being able to pace myself effectively. With Miguel, I worried that he would think I was complaining or being too needy. I felt guilty for even considering asking for help.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mariana. It seems like your core belief about independence and strength is influencing your thoughts and emotions in these situations. Today, I'd like to focus on exploring this core belief further and discuss strategies for challenging it. We can also review your experience with the homework and practice some more thought records and cognitive restructuring. Does that sound okay to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds good. I really want to work on this core belief because I know it's holding me back.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's add that to our agenda for today. We'll start by reviewing your homework, then explore your core belief and discuss strategies for challenging it. We'll also practice some more thought records and cognitive restructuring. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: I'd also like to discuss how I can better express my needs to Miguel and others without feeling guilty or like a burden.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent point, Mariana. We can definitely include that in our agenda. So, to summarize, our plan for today is to:\n1. Review your homework and experiences since the last session\n2. Explore your core belief about independence and strength\n3. Discuss strategies for challenging this core belief\n4. Practice thought records and cognitive restructuring\n5. Discuss ways to express your needs effectively without feeling guilty or like a burden\n\nDoes this agenda sound comprehensive to you, or is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers everything. Let's start with reviewing my homework.",
