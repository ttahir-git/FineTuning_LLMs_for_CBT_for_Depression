  "transcript": "Patient: Activity pacing sounds like it could be helpful. I often push myself too hard and end up paying for it later with increased pain and fatigue.\n\nTherapist: That's a common experience for many people with chronic pain. Activity pacing can help you find a balance between rest and activity, so you can engage in the things you enjoy without overdoing it.\n\nTo start, let's think of an activity you'd like to work on pacing. It could be a household chore, a hobby, or even attending your fitness class. What comes to mind?\n\nPatient: I think I'd like to work on pacing myself with my studies. I tend to push myself to keep up with my coursework, even when I'm in pain, and it leaves me feeling drained and discouraged.\n\nTherapist: That's a great choice, Mariana. Studying is an important part of your life, and finding a way to manage it without exacerbating your pain is crucial. Let's break down your study sessions into smaller, more manageable tasks.\n\nWhat does a typical study session look like for you now?\n\nPatient: Usually, I try to sit down for a few hours at a time and power through as much reading and assignments as I can. I often lose track of time and don't realize how much pain I'm in until I try to stand up.\n\nTherapist: I see. With activity pacing, we'll aim to break that time into shorter chunks with scheduled breaks. For example, you could try studying for 30 minutes, then taking a 10-minute break to stretch, walk around, or practice a relaxation technique. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds more manageable. I think the breaks would help me avoid getting too caught up in my work and losing track of my pain.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. During your breaks, it's essential to listen to your body and assess your pain level. If you're experiencing increased pain, you may need to adjust the length of your study and break times accordingly.\n\nAnother important aspect of activity pacing is setting realistic goals for each study session. Instead of trying to accomplish everything at once, focus on one task at a time and celebrate your progress along the way.\n\nPatient: Setting realistic goals is something I struggle with. I often feel like I need to do it all, and I end up feeling overwhelmed and disappointed in myself when I can't.\n\nTherapist: That's a great observation, Mariana. This ties back to our earlier discussion about challenging negative thoughts and feelings of inadequacy. As you practice activity pacing, it will be helpful to use thought records to reframe any negative thoughts that arise related to your progress or ability to keep up with your studies.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this struggle. Many people with chronic pain face similar challenges, and it's okay to adjust your expectations and be kind to yourself in the process.\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder. I'll try to keep that in mind as I work on pacing myself.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mariana. I'm here to support you every step of the way. As you practice activity pacing this week, pay attention to how it affects your pain levels and emotions. We can discuss your experiences in our next session and make any necessary adjustments.\n\nPatient: I will. Thank you for your help and support.",
