  "transcript": "Therapist: Let's start by reviewing your thought records, Mariana. Can you share an example of a situation where you found it challenging to identify alternative thoughts?\n\nPatient: Sure, Nova. Last week, I had a particularly bad day with my chronic pain. I couldn't focus on my studies, and I had to cancel my plans with my fitness group. I felt like I was letting everyone down, including myself. My automatic thought was, \"I'm a burden to everyone, and I'll never be able to keep up with my responsibilities.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mariana. I can understand how that situation would lead to those difficult thoughts and feelings. Let's look at the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're a burden to everyone?\n\nPatient: Well, I had to cancel my plans with my fitness group, and I feel like I'm not pulling my weight in my studies or at home with Miguel.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you feel like you're not able to contribute as much as you'd like due to your chronic pain. Now, let's consider the evidence against the thought that you're a burden. What would you say to a friend who was in a similar situation?\n\nPatient: I would probably tell them that they're doing the best they can and that their friends and family understand and want to support them.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Mariana. It's often easier to show compassion to others than to ourselves. Based on that, what could be an alternative thought to \"I'm a burden to everyone, and I'll never be able to keep up with my responsibilities\"?\n\nPatient: I guess an alternative thought could be, \"I'm doing the best I can, and my friends and family understand and want to support me, even when I have bad days.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful alternative thought, Mariana. It acknowledges your efforts and the understanding of those around you. How does that thought feel compared to the original one?\n\nPatient: It feels more compassionate and less judgmental. It reminds me that I'm not alone and that people care about me.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. By finding alternative thoughts, we can start to shift our perspective and be kinder to ourselves. Remember, our thoughts are not always accurate reflections of reality. Let's practice finding alternative thoughts with another example from your thought records.\n\nPatient: Okay, here's another one. The other day, I couldn't finish my homework for my veterinary technology program because I was in too much pain. My automatic thought was, \"I'm never going to be able to finish this program and have a career. I'm a failure.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a tough thought to deal with, Mariana. Let's look at the evidence for and against it, just like we did before. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you'll never finish the program and that you're a failure?\n\nPatient: I've had to miss some classes and deadlines because of my pain, and I feel like I'm falling behind.\n\nTherapist: I understand that missing classes and deadlines can make you feel like you're not making progress. Now, let's consider the evidence against that thought. What are some reasons to believe that you can still finish the program and have a successful career?\n\nPatient: Well, I've managed to keep up with most of my work, even with my chronic pain. And my professors have been understanding when I've had to miss classes or deadlines. They've told me that they believe in me and want to support me.\n\nTherapist: Those are significant pieces of evidence against the thought that you'll never finish the program and that you're a failure. Based on that, what could be an alternative thought?\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"Even though I have setbacks due to my chronic pain, I'm still making progress in my program, and my professors believe in me and want to support me.\"\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent alternative thought, Mariana. It acknowledges the challenges you face while also recognizing your progress and the support you have. How does that thought make you feel?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel more hopeful and less like a failure. It reminds me that I'm not alone and that people believe in me.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Mariana. You're doing a great job of finding alternative thoughts. Remember, it's a skill that takes practice, so don't be too hard on yourself if it feels challenging at times. The more you practice, the easier it will become.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance.",
