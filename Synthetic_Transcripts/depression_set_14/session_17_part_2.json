  "transcript": "Patient: I've been trying to use the thought records and Downward Arrow technique when I catch myself thinking negatively, but it's been challenging to do it consistently, especially on days when I'm really struggling with my fibromyalgia.\n\nTherapist: It's great that you've been making an effort to use the techniques we've discussed, even though it's been difficult at times. Consistency can be a challenge, particularly when dealing with chronic pain. Let's explore this a bit further. Can you share an example of a situation where you found it hard to use the thought records or Downward Arrow technique?\n\nPatient: Sure. Last week, I had a particularly bad fibromyalgia flare-up. I was in a lot of pain and had to miss one of my classes. I started thinking, \"I'm never going to be able to keep up with my studies\" and \"I'm just a burden on everyone around me.\" I tried to use the thought record to challenge those thoughts, but I was in so much pain that I couldn't focus on anything else.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a really tough situation, Mariana. It's understandable that it was difficult to use the techniques when you were in the midst of a painful flare-up. In situations like these, it might be helpful to have a simplified version of the thought record or a go-to coping statement that you can use when it's hard to focus on the full technique. For example, you could remind yourself, \"I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough for now\" or \"This pain is temporary, and I will get through it.\" What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. Having a simpler version of the thought record or a coping statement might make it easier to manage my thoughts when I'm really struggling with pain. I'll try to come up with a few statements that resonate with me.\n\nTherapist: That's a great plan. We can work on developing those simplified thought records and coping statements together. Remember, the goal is to find what works best for you, and that might look different depending on the situation and how you're feeling.\n\nPatient: Thank you, that's really helpful. I also wanted to mention that I've been trying to prioritize self-care, like we discussed. I've been taking more baths and reading for pleasure, and I've noticed that it does help me feel a bit better, even if it's just for a short while.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Mariana. Engaging in self-care activities can make a big difference in managing your depression symptoms and overall well-being. It's great that you've been able to prioritize those activities and notice the positive impact they have on your mood. Let's continue to explore ways to incorporate self-care into your daily routine, even on days when you're struggling with pain or low mood.\n\nPatient: I'd like that. I know I need to be better about taking care of myself, but it's hard when I feel like I should be focusing on my studies or helping out more around the house.\n\nTherapist: It's common to feel guilty or like you're not doing enough, especially when you're dealing with a chronic illness. However, it's essential to remember that taking care of yourself is not selfish. In fact, by prioritizing your well-being, you're actually putting yourself in a better position to manage your responsibilities and be there for others. It's all about finding a balance that works for you.",
