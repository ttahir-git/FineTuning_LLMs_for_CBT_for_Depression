  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate you taking the time to understand my situation. It's comforting to know that we'll be working on developing more compassionate ways of thinking about myself and my circumstances.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad this approach resonates with you, Mariana. Building self-compassion and challenging unrealistic expectations can be powerful tools in managing depression.\n\nI'd like to shift our focus a bit and explore the coping mechanisms you've been using to deal with your depression and fibromyalgia. Can you share some of the strategies you've employed to manage your symptoms and emotions?\n\nPatient: Well, I've always found solace in my faith. Praying and attending church regularly helps me feel grounded and supported. I also try to stay active by going to my fitness classes when I can. Being around people who understand my limitations and encourage me is really helpful.\n\nHowever, I've also developed some unhealthy coping mechanisms, like drinking alcohol to numb the pain and escape my thoughts. I know it's not a good solution, but sometimes it feels like the only way to get some relief.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for being open about your coping mechanisms, Mariana. It's common for people to develop a mix of healthy and unhealthy strategies to deal with emotional and physical pain. Your faith and fitness classes seem to provide you with a sense of community and support, which can be invaluable.\n\nRegarding your use of alcohol to cope, I appreciate your honesty. Substance use is a common but problematic way of managing distress. As we progress in therapy, we'll work on developing alternative, healthier strategies to help you cope with your symptoms and emotions.\n\nI'm curious about your support system. Aside from your fitness group, who else do you turn to for emotional support and understanding?\n\nPatient: My husband, Miguel, is my biggest supporter. He's always there for me, even though he works long hours. I don't like to burden him too much with my problems, though, because I know he's already stressed with work.\n\nI also have a few close friends from church, but I haven't been as open with them about my struggles. I worry that they might not understand or that I'll be a burden to them as well.\n\nTherapist: It's good to hear that you have Miguel's support, Mariana. It's also understandable to have concerns about burdening others with your struggles. Many people worry that they'll overwhelm their loved ones if they share too much.\n\nIn therapy, we'll work on finding a balance between relying on your support system and developing your own coping skills. It's important to have both internal and external resources to draw upon.\n\nI'd like to ask about any previous experiences you've had with therapy or treatment for depression. Have you sought help before? If so, what was your experience like?\n\nPatient: I've never been to therapy before. I always thought I should be able to handle my problems on my own. But lately, I've realized that I need help, and that's why I'm here.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mariana. Seeking help is a brave and important step. Many people share your initial belief that they should be able to handle their problems independently. However, reaching out for support is a sign of strength and self-awareness.\n\nAs we near the end of our session today, I want to acknowledge the progress we've made in understanding your experiences with depression and fibromyalgia. We've discussed your current life situation, the impact of your symptoms on your studies and relationships, your coping mechanisms, and your support system.",
