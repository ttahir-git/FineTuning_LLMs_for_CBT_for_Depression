  "transcript": "Patient: That agenda sounds good to me, Nova. I'm ready to discuss my thought record and learn more about CBT.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by reviewing your thought record. Can you share some of the situations, emotions, and thoughts you noted over the past week?\n\nPatient: Sure. One situation that stood out was when I had a particularly bad day with my fibromyalgia pain. I was feeling frustrated and helpless. My thoughts were along the lines of \"I'll never be able to keep up with my studies\" and \"I'm just a burden on Miguel.\"\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mariana. Those thoughts are great examples of how our emotions can be influenced by our thoughts. In CBT, we call these types of negative thought patterns \"cognitive distortions.\" They're often irrational or exaggerated thoughts that contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety.\n\nPatient: I can see how my thoughts might be distorted, but it's hard to believe otherwise when I'm in so much pain and struggling to keep up.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid point, Mariana. Chronic pain can certainly make it more challenging to challenge those negative thoughts. However, the goal of CBT isn't to dismiss your real experiences, but rather to help you find more balanced and helpful ways of thinking about them.\n\nFor example, when you think \"I'll never be able to keep up with my studies,\" that's an example of a cognitive distortion called \"fortune telling,\" where you're predicting a negative outcome without evidence. A more balanced thought might be, \"My pain makes studying more difficult, but I can talk to my professors about accommodations and take things one day at a time.\"\n\nPatient: I can see how that would be a more helpful way of thinking. But it's hard to change those thought patterns in the moment.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, it takes practice to challenge those long-standing thought patterns. That's why we start by simply noticing and recording them, like you did with your thought record. As we continue with CBT, we'll work on building skills to actively challenge and reframe those thoughts.\n\nAnother cognitive distortion I noticed in your example is \"labeling,\" when you called yourself a burden on Miguel. This involves defining yourself by a single negative attribute, rather than seeing the full picture.\n\nPatient: You're right, I do tend to label myself negatively. But I feel like such a burden when I can't contribute as much to our household and relationship.\n\nTherapist: It's understandable to feel that way, Mariana. But I wonder if we can explore that thought further. What evidence do you have that Miguel sees you as a burden?",
