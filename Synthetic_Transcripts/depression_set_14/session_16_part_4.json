  "transcript": "Therapist: You've done a great job today, Mariana. I know we've covered a lot of ground, and I want to check in with you before we wrap up. How are you feeling after our session today?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit tired, but also hopeful. It's a lot to process, but I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful to hear, Mariana. It's completely normal to feel tired after a session like this. You've done some really important and challenging work today. I want to encourage you to take some time for self-care after our session, whether that's taking a nap, going for a gentle walk, or doing something else that feels nourishing to you.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I think I will take a bath and read a bit. That usually helps me relax.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great plan. Before we end our session, let's talk about some homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought records, focusing on situations where that core belief about not being good enough comes up. When you notice that belief, try to challenge it using the evidence we talked about today. You can also practice the Downward Arrow technique to see if you can identify any other underlying beliefs. How does that feel for you?\n\nPatient: It feels manageable. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to keep trying.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Mariana. Remember, it's not about being perfect, it's about practicing and learning. Every small step counts. If you have any questions or concerns during the week, feel free to write them down and bring them to our next session. We can always trouble-shoot together.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate that. I'll do my best with the homework and let you know how it goes.\n\nTherapist: Great. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Remember, you're not alone in this. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I'll see you next week.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Challenging core belief of not being good enough, practicing thought records and Downward Arrow technique, managing depression symptoms during fibromyalgia flare-ups, importance of self-care and self-compassion.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Thought records: Continuing to identify and reframe negative thoughts related to core belief of not being good enough.
