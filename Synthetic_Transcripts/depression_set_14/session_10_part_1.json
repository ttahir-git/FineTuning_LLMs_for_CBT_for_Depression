  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mariana, it's great to see you again for our 10th session. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. I want to acknowledge that while I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like reframing \"should\" statements and mindfulness. It's been challenging, especially on days when my pain is severe. I often find myself feeling guilty for not being able to do more and for relying on Miguel so much.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Mariana. It's common to face challenges when implementing new techniques, especially when dealing with chronic pain. Let's explore your feelings of guilt further. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come up when you feel guilty for relying on Miguel?\n\nPatient: Well, I often think that I should be able to handle everything on my own, despite my pain. I feel like I'm a burden to Miguel and that he deserves a partner who can keep up with him. I know he's supportive, but I can't help but feel like I'm holding him back.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mariana. It seems like you have some deeply held beliefs about what you should be able to do and what it means to be a good partner. Let's take a closer look at these thoughts and see if we can reframe them in a more balanced way. Would you be open to that?\n\nPatient: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I know my thoughts aren't always rational, but it's hard to change them.\n\nTherapist: You're right, changing long-held beliefs can be challenging, but it's possible with practice. Let's start by setting an agenda for today's session. We can prioritize exploring your feelings of guilt and inadequacy, as well as discussing strategies for managing your chronic pain and emotions. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'd also like to talk about how I can communicate my needs better to Miguel and my family. I often feel like I'm not being clear about what I need from them.\n\nTherapist: That's a great addition to our agenda. Improving communication skills can be very helpful in managing relationships and expressing your needs. So, our agenda for today includes:\n\n1. Exploring feelings of guilt and inadequacy\n2. Discussing strategies for managing chronic pain and emotions\n3. Improving communication skills to express needs and emotions effectively\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main things I'd like to focus on today.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by exploring your feelings of guilt and inadequacy. Can you tell me about a recent situation where these feelings were particularly strong?",
