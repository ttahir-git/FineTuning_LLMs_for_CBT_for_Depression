  "transcript": "Patient: Last week, I needed help with some household chores because of my fibromyalgia flare-up. I wanted to ask Miguel for help, but I felt guilty about burdening him with more tasks after he had a long day at work.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Mariana. It's a common struggle for many people to ask for help when they need it, especially when they feel like they might be burdening others. Let's explore this situation further. What thoughts were going through your mind when you considered asking Miguel for help?\n\nPatient: I thought, \"He's already so tired from work, I shouldn't bother him with more tasks.

We can see how these thoughts and beliefs are connected and how they contribute to your difficulty in expressing your needs and asking for help. Let's challenge these beliefs using the evidence for and against technique. What evidence do you have that supports the belief that asking for help means you're weak and incapable?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess there's the fact that I used to be able to handle all the household tasks on my own before my fibromyalgia got worse.
