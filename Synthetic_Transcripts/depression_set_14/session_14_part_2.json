  "transcript": "Patient: Sure, I can walk you through my experience with the thought records. One specific negative thought that keeps coming up for me is \"I'm not good enough.\" It's a thought that I've struggled with for a long time, but it's been especially challenging since my fibromyalgia diagnosis. I find myself thinking this whenever I have to ask for help or when I can't do something because of my pain.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mariana. The thought \"I'm not good enough\" is a common one that many people struggle with, and it can be particularly challenging when dealing with a chronic illness. Let's explore this thought further. Can you tell me about a specific situation in the past week where this thought came up for you?\n\nPatient: Yes, just a few days ago, actually. I was having a particularly bad flare-up and I needed help with some household chores. I had to ask Miguel for help, and even though he was more than willing to do it, I felt guilty for asking. I kept thinking to myself, \"I'm not good enough. I should be able to do this on my own.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a great example, Mariana. Let's use this situation to walk through the thought record process. First, can you tell me what emotions you were feeling in that moment and how intense they were on a scale of 0-100?\n\nPatient: I was feeling frustrated, both with myself and with my situation. I'd say that was around an 80. I was also feeling guilty for having to ask for help, which was probably around a 90.\n\nTherapist: Okay, so you were feeling frustrated at an intensity of 80 and guilty at an intensity of 90. Those are strong emotions. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm not good enough.\" What evidence do you have that supports this thought?\n\nPatient: Well, I couldn't do the household chores on my own. I had to ask for help, which makes me feel like I'm not good enough. I also feel like I'm not good enough because I can't do all the things I used to be able to do before my diagnosis.\n\nTherapist: I understand how those situations can make you feel that way. Now, let's look at the evidence against the thought \"I'm not good enough.\" What evidence do you have that goes against this thought?\n\nPatient: I suppose, objectively, I know that asking for help doesn't mean I'm not good enough. Everyone needs help sometimes. And even though I can't do everything I used to, I'm still doing the best I can. I'm still showing up for my studies and my work at the animal shelter, even if it's not always easy.\n\nTherapist: That's great insight, Mariana. You're able to recognize that asking for help is a normal part of being human, and that you're still showing up and doing your best despite your challenges. Now, based on the evidence for and against the thought \"I'm not good enough,\" what would be a more balanced and realistic thought?\n\nPatient: I guess a more balanced thought would be something like, \"Asking for help doesn't mean I'm not good enough. I'm doing my best with the challenges I have, and that's enough.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful reframe, Mariana. How do you feel when you think this thought instead of \"I'm not good enough\"?\n\nPatient: When I think this new thought, I feel a bit less frustrated and guilty. Maybe the frustration goes down to a 50 and the guilt to a 60.\n\nTherapist: That's a significant reduction in intensity for both emotions. This shows how powerful our thoughts can be in influencing how we feel. As we continue to practice this process, it will become easier to catch these negative thoughts and reframe them in the moment.\n\nPatient: I can see how this could be really helpful. It's just hard to remember to do it in the moment, especially when I'm in pain or feeling really down.\n\nTherapist: That's a valid point, Mariana. It can be challenging to remember to use these techniques in the moment, especially during a flare-up. One strategy that can be helpful is to set aside a specific time each day to practice the thought record. This can help build the habit and make it easier to use the technique when you need it most. What do you think about that idea?\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I think setting aside a specific time each day to practice could help me get better at using the thought records when I need them most.\n\nTherapist: Great! Let's add that to your homework for this week - setting aside a specific time each day to practice the thought record. As we continue to work together, we can also explore other strategies for managing your negative thoughts during flare-ups, such as using coping statements or mindfulness techniques.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm willing to try anything that might help me manage my thoughts and feelings better.\n\nTherapist: Your willingness to try new strategies is admirable, Mariana. It shows your commitment to your well-being and your resilience in the face of challenges. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about communicating your needs to Miguel and your family. Can you tell me what makes this challenging for you?",
