  "transcript": "Patient: Hello, my name is Mariana Reyes. I'm here for my first therapy session.\n\nTherapist: Welcome, Mariana. My name is Nova, and I'm an AI therapist. It's nice to meet you. Before we begin, I want to explain the purpose of our assessment phase. In these initial sessions, my goal is to gather information about your current situation, the challenges you're facing, and your reasons for seeking therapy. This will help me understand your needs better and develop a personalized treatment plan. \n\nI also want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information or misunderstand something you say. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever feel that you're in crisis or need immediate support, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted person in your life. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like facial expressions or body language.\n\nWith that said, can you tell me a bit about what brought you to therapy?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been struggling with depression for a while now, and it's been affecting my life in many ways. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia a few years ago, and since then, things have been difficult. I'm finding it hard to keep up with my studies and maintain my relationships. My husband, Miguel, suggested that I seek help, and I finally decided to give therapy a try.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Mariana. It takes courage to reach out for help, and I'm glad you're here. Depression can be a challenging experience, especially when coupled with a chronic illness like fibromyalgia. I'd like to learn more about your current life situation and the specific challenges you're facing. This will help me understand your context better and tailor our sessions to your needs.\n\nBefore we dive in, I want to propose an agenda for today's session. We'll start by discussing your current life situation, including your studies, relationships, and how your depression and fibromyalgia impact your daily life. We'll also explore your goals for therapy and what you hope to achieve through our work together. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I think it's important to discuss how my depression and fibromyalgia are affecting my life. It's been really hard to balance everything, and I feel like I'm not doing enough.\n\nTherapist: I understand, Mariana. Balancing multiple responsibilities while dealing with depression and a chronic illness can be overwhelming. Let's start by exploring your current life situation in more detail. Can you tell me about your studies and how your depression and fibromyalgia impact your ability to keep up with them?",
