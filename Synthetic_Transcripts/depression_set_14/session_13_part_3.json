  "transcript": "Therapist: You were saying that needing more help with household tasks due to your fibromyalgia makes you feel like you're weak and incapable. Let's explore this further. What evidence do you have that contradicts this belief?\n\nPatient: Well, I suppose the fact that I'm still attending my fitness classes and taking care of the animals at the shelter, even with my fibromyalgia, shows that I'm not entirely weak or incapable. And Miguel has never complained about helping me; he's always very supportive.\n\nTherapist: That's an excellent point, Mariana. You're able to recognize that despite your illness, you're still engaging in activities that are important to you and taking care of your responsibilities to the best of your abilities. This contradicts the belief that you're weak and incapable. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the belief that asking for help means you're a burden to Miguel.\n\nPatient: The evidence for it is that I feel like I'm adding more tasks to his plate when he's already tired from work. But the evidence against it is that Miguel has never said I'm a burden. In fact, he often tells me that he's happy to help and that we're a team.\n\nTherapist: Exactly. It's important to consider both sides of the evidence and not just focus on the thoughts that support your negative beliefs. Miguel's words and actions show that he doesn't view you as a burden, and he's willing to support you when you need help. How does considering this evidence affect your belief about being a burden?\n\nPatient: It makes me question whether that belief is entirely true. I guess I've been focusing more on my own thoughts and feelings rather than considering Miguel's perspective.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight, Mariana. It's common for people to get caught up in their own negative thoughts and beliefs, but considering alternative perspectives can help challenge those beliefs. Now, let's generate an alternative thought based on the evidence we've discussed.\n\nPatient: An alternative thought could be, \"Asking for help when I need it doesn't mean I'm weak or a burden. I'm doing my best to manage my illness and responsibilities, and Miguel is supportive and willing to help me when I need it.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a much more balanced and adaptive thought, Mariana. How does this alternative thought make you feel compared to the original negative thought?\n\nPatient: It makes me feel less guilty and more empowered to ask for help when I need it. I still might struggle with it sometimes, but I feel more confident in challenging those negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Mariana. Remember, challenging negative thoughts and beliefs takes practice, and it's okay if you don't always find it easy. The important thing is that you're making progress and developing the skills to manage your thoughts and emotions more effectively.",
