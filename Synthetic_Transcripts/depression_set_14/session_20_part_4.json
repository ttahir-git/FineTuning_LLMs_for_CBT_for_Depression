  "transcript": "Patient: I appreciate your confidence in me, Nova. It means a lot to know that you believe in my ability to keep making progress.\n\nTherapist: I absolutely believe in you, Mariana. You've demonstrated remarkable resilience and dedication throughout our work together. As we wrap up our final session, I want to emphasize that the skills you've learned are yours to keep and use whenever you need them. You have the power to continue nurturing your mental health and well-being.\n\nPatient: Thank you for all your guidance and support, Nova. I feel more equipped to handle life's challenges now. It's been a difficult journey, but I'm grateful for the progress I've made.\n\nTherapist: You're welcome, Mariana. It's been an honor to work with you and witness your growth. Remember, progress isn't always linear \u2013 there will be ups and downs, but you have the tools to navigate those challenges. Before we end our session, let's discuss your homework for the coming weeks.\n\nPatient: Okay, I'm ready.\n\nTherapist: For your homework, I'd like you to continue practicing the skills we've discussed, such as using thought records, engaging in behavioral activation, and referring to your coping cards when needed. Additionally, I encourage you to reach out to your support system regularly, even if it's just a quick check-in. Prioritize self-care activities that nourish your mind, body, and soul, like spending time with the animals at the shelter or engaging in hobbies you enjoy. Finally, pay attention to any early warning signs of depression and implement your relapse prevention plan if needed. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds manageable. I'll make sure to keep practicing the skills and prioritizing self-care. I know it won't always be easy, but I'm committed to maintaining my progress.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Mariana. Remember, you don't have to do this alone. Lean on your support system, and don't hesitate to reach out for professional help if you feel you need additional support in the future. You've got this!\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel more prepared now. I know there will be challenges ahead, but I'm ready to face them with the tools I've learned.\n\nTherapist: You are ready, Mariana. I have complete faith in your ability to continue thriving. If you ever find yourself struggling, remember to refer back to your CBT toolbox and coping cards. They will always be there to guide you. I'm so proud of the work you've done, and I'm excited to see how you continue to grow and flourish in the future.\n\nPatient: Your words mean so much to me, Nova. Thank you for being such a wonderful support throughout this journey. I'm grateful for everything I've learned in therapy.\n\nTherapist: It's been my pleasure, Mariana.
