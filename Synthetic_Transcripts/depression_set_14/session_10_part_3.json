  "transcript": "Patient: I think activity pacing could be helpful for me. I often try to push through my pain and end up exhausting myself, which only makes the pain worse in the long run. Breaking tasks into smaller steps and taking breaks could help me manage my pain better and avoid those crashes.\n\nTherapist: You're absolutely right, Mariana. Activity pacing can be a powerful tool in managing chronic pain and preventing those cycles of overexertion and exhaustion. Let's practice applying this technique to a specific task or activity you find challenging. Can you think of an example?\n\nPatient: One thing that comes to mind is grocery shopping. I usually try to do all my shopping in one trip, even if I'm in pain, because I feel like I need to get it done. But by the end of the trip, I'm usually in a lot of pain and exhausted.\n\nTherapist: Grocery shopping is a great example. Let's break this task down into smaller steps and identify places where you can incorporate breaks. What are the main steps involved in grocery shopping for you?\n\nPatient: First, I make a list of what I need. Then, I drive to the store, walk around and collect the items, wait in line to pay, load the groceries into my car, drive home, and finally, carry the groceries inside and put them away.\n\nTherapist: That's a clear breakdown of the steps. Now, where do you think you could incorporate breaks or modify the task to make it more manageable?\n\nPatient: I could start by making a more organized list, so I can be more efficient in the store and avoid walking back and forth too much. I could also use a cart or ask for help loading the groceries into my car. And maybe I could take a break in my car before driving home, especially if I'm feeling particularly tired or in pain.\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent ideas, Mariana. By organizing your list, using a cart, asking for help, and taking a break before driving home, you're pacing yourself and reducing the overall strain on your body. How do you think implementing these changes would impact your pain and emotions during and after grocery shopping?\n\nPatient: I think I would feel less overwhelmed and more in control. I might still have some pain, but it wouldn't be as intense, and I wouldn't feel as exhausted afterward. I might even feel a sense of accomplishment for taking care of myself and managing my pain better.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. By pacing yourself, you're not only reducing physical strain but also taking care of your emotional well-being. This can help break the cycle of pain, exhaustion, and negative emotions. I encourage you to practice activity pacing with grocery shopping and other tasks over the next week. Pay attention to how it impacts your pain and emotions, and we can discuss your experiences in our next session.\n\nPatient: I will definitely try that. I'm hopeful that it will make a difference in how I feel, both physically and emotionally.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Mariana. Remember, it's okay to start small and build up gradually. Be patient with yourself as you practice this new skill. Now, let's shift our focus to improving communication with Miguel and expressing your needs more effectively. Can you tell me about a recent situation where you struggled to communicate your needs?",
