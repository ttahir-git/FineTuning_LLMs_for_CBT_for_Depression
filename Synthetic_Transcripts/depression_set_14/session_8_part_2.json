  "transcript": "Patient: I had a situation last week where I couldn't attend my fitness class because my pain was too severe. I felt guilty for not being able to keep up with the group and inadequate because I couldn't push through the pain like I used to.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mariana. Let's explore this further using a thought record. Can you walk me through the situation, your emotions, and the thoughts that came up?\n\nPatient: The situation was me lying in bed, unable to get up and go to my fitness class. I felt frustrated, disappointed in myself, and guilty. I thought, \"I'm letting my fitness group down,\" and \"I should be able to push through the pain like I used to.\"\n\nTherapist: Okay, let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you're letting your fitness group down?\n\nPatient: Well, they're all there, supporting each other, and I'm not. I feel like I'm not contributing to the group when I'm absent.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against that thought?\n\nPatient: I suppose my fitness group has been understanding of my limitations. They often tell me not to push myself too hard and that they're happy to see me whenever I can make it.\n\nTherapist: That's a great point, Mariana. It shows that your fitness group cares about your well-being and understands your situation. Now, let's look at the thought \"I should be able to push through the pain like I used to.\" What evidence do you have for this thought?\n\nPatient: I used to be able to do it before my fibromyalgia got worse. I feel like I'm weaker now and that I should be able to overcome the pain mentally.\n\nTherapist: And what evidence do you have against that thought?\n\nPatient: My doctor has told me that pushing through the pain can actually make my condition worse. And I know that my pain has increased over time, so it's not realistic to expect myself to do what I used to.\n\nTherapist: You've made some great insights, Mariana. Based on the evidence, can you come up with an alternative thought?\n\nPatient: I guess an alternative thought could be, \"My fitness group understands my limitations and supports me even when I can't attend. It's okay to listen to my body and rest when I need to.\"\n\nTherapist: That's a wonderful alternative thought, Mariana. It's more balanced and compassionate towards yourself. How do you feel now after going through this thought record?\n\nPatient: I feel a bit lighter, actually. It's helpful to look at the evidence and challenge my negative thoughts.\n\nTherapist: I'm glad to hear that, Mariana. Thought records can be a powerful tool in managing negative thoughts and emotions. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to challenge those thoughts in the moment.\n\nNow, I'd like to discuss some strategies for managing your chronic pain and the emotions that come with it. One technique that can be helpful is called \"activity pacing.\" This involves breaking down activities into smaller, more manageable tasks and taking breaks in between to avoid overexertion. What do you think about trying this technique?",
