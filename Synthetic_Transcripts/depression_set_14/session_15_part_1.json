  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mariana, it's great to see you again for session 15. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like thought records and assertive communication. It's been challenging, but I've had some small successes. I've also been more mindful of my self-care during fibromyalgia flare-ups, which has helped a bit with managing my depression symptoms.\n\nTherapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and have had some successes. Small steps can lead to significant progress over time. You mentioned that it's been challenging - can you tell me more about the difficulties you've faced while implementing these techniques?\n\nPatient: Well, I still struggle with expressing my needs and asking for help. I feel guilty for burdening others, especially Miguel. Even when I manage to ask for help, I feel like I'm not doing enough or that I should be able to handle everything on my own.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Mariana. It's common to feel guilty or like a burden when asking for help, especially when you have a core belief that needing help means you're weak or incapable. I'm glad you're able to recognize this pattern. Let's explore this further today and work on reframing that belief. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I know I need to work on changing that belief, but it's so deeply ingrained in me.\n\nTherapist: I understand. Changing core beliefs takes time and practice. Today, we can focus on identifying specific situations where this belief comes up and work on reframing it in those contexts. We can also discuss your experience with the self-care plan and mindfulness during fibromyalgia flare-ups. Does that align with your priorities for today's session?\n\nPatient: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I'd also like to discuss how I can better manage my depression symptoms during flare-ups, as that's been a significant challenge for me.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, we can definitely address that as well. So, our agenda for today includes:\n1. Exploring situations where your core belief about needing help comes up and working on reframing it.\n2. Discussing your experience with the self-care plan and mindfulness during fibromyalgia flare-ups.\n3. Identifying strategies for managing depression symptoms during flare-ups.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: No, I think that covers the main points I'd like to focus on today.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start with the first item on our agenda - exploring situations where your core belief about needing help comes up. Can you think of a recent situation where you struggled with asking for help or expressing your needs?",
