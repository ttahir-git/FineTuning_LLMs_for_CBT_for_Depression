  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mariana, it's great to see you again for session 8. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last session. I want to acknowledge that as your AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. \n\nWith that said, I'm here to support you in managing your depression and working towards your goals. How have you been since our last session? Can you share how your mood has been and if there have been any significant changes or experiences?\n\nPatient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations. I understand and appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the techniques we discussed, like mindfulness and progressive muscle relaxation. Some days are better than others, but I still find it challenging, especially when my chronic pain flares up. I've also been struggling with feelings of guilt and inadequacy, particularly when I feel like I'm not able to keep up with my responsibilities at home and in my studies.\n\nTherapist: I appreciate your honesty, Mariana. It's common to have ups and downs when managing depression, and chronic pain can certainly make it more challenging. I'm glad you've been practicing the techniques we've discussed, even if it's difficult at times. \n\nToday, I'd like to focus on exploring your feelings of guilt and inadequacy further, as well as discuss strategies for managing your chronic pain and the emotions that come with it. We can also review your experience with the homework and continue practicing the techniques we've covered so far. Does this sound like a good plan for our session today? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?\n\nPatient: That sounds like a good plan. I think it's important to address these feelings of guilt and inadequacy, as they've been weighing heavily on me. I'm also interested in learning more about managing my chronic pain and the emotions that come with it. I don't have anything else to add to the agenda, but I'm open to discussing anything you think might be helpful.\n\nTherapist: Great, let's start by exploring your feelings of guilt and inadequacy. Can you share a specific situation or thought that triggered these feelings recently?",
