  "transcript": "Therapist: Another helpful tool for maintaining your progress is creating coping cards. These are small, portable reminders of the adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs you've developed in therapy. You can write them on index cards or even create digital versions on your phone. What are some thoughts or beliefs you'd like to include on your coping cards?\n\nPatient: I could write things like \"I am resilient and capable of managing my thoughts and emotions\" or \"Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\" I might also include reminders to use my CBT skills, like \"Thoughts are not facts\" or \"Focus on the present moment.\"\n\nTherapist: Those are excellent examples of coping card statements. Having these reminders readily available can be really helpful in challenging moments. You can also include inspirational quotes or affirmations that resonate with you.\n\nPatient: I like that idea. I have a few quotes that always make me feel more hopeful and motivated.\n\nTherapist: As we wrap up our work together, I want to emphasize how much progress you've made, Mariana. You've developed a strong understanding of CBT concepts and have been consistently applying the skills in your daily life. Remember, setbacks and challenges are a normal part of the process, but you have the tools and resilience to cope with them.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Nova. I feel more prepared now to handle things on my own, even though I know it won't always be easy.\n\nTherapist: Before we end our session, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now, and do you have any final thoughts or questions?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling a mix of emotions - proud of the progress I've made, but also a bit nervous about not having our regular sessions. But I know I have the tools and support I need to keep moving forward. I don't have any specific questions right now, but I appreciate knowing that I can always reach out if I need help in the future.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions as we end our sessions. Remember, you've done the hard work of building a strong foundation of CBT skills, and that will serve you well going forward. If you do find yourself needing additional support, don't hesitate to reach out to your support system or seek professional help.\n\nFor your homework this week, I'd like you to create your personalized CBT toolbox and coping cards. Take some time to reflect on the skills and strategies that have been most helpful for you, and write them down in a way that feels accessible and meaningful. You can also start implementing your relapse prevention plan, paying attention to early warning signs and engaging in self-care activities.\n\nIn our final session next week, we'll review your toolbox and coping cards, discuss any challenges or successes you've had in implementing your relapse prevention plan, and celebrate the progress you've made throughout our work together.\n\nSession Summary:\n- Main topics discussed: Reinforcing CBT skills, building confidence in using skills independently, creating a relapse prevention plan, discussing options for ongoing support, introducing coping cards, and reviewing progress made in therapy.\n- Techniques or exercises used:\n  - Review of CBT skills learned (thought records, self-care plan, behavioral activation, etc.)\n  - Problem-solving future challenges using CBT techniques\n  - Creating a personalized CBT toolbox\n  - Developing a relapse prevention plan, including identifying early warning signs and strategies to cope\n  - Introducing coping cards with adaptive thoughts, strategies, and new core beliefs\n  - Progress: Mariana has made significant progress in understanding and applying CBT concepts, developing a more balanced perspective on her thoughts and beliefs, and prioritizing her mental health and self-care. She is feeling more confident in her ability to use CBT skills independently, although she acknowledges that setbacks and challenges may still arise.\n- Homework assigned: Create a personalized CBT toolbox and coping cards, implement the relapse prevention plan, and pay attention to early warning signs and self-care activities.\n- Patient's progress, challenges, depression symptoms and important personal details: Mariana is feeling proud of her progress but also nervous about ending therapy. She has identified potential early warning signs of worsening depression symptoms and has developed strategies to cope with them, including reaching out to her support system and engaging in self-care activities.\n- Core beliefs and intermediate beliefs: Mariana has been working on challenging her core belief of not being good enough and her intermediate belief that she should be able to handle everything on her own. She has developed more adaptive beliefs, such as \"I am resilient and capable\" and \"Asking for help is a sign of strength.\"\n- Important information to carry forward to future sessions: Mariana's personalized CBT toolbox and coping cards, her relapse prevention plan, and her ongoing progress in challenging negative thoughts and beliefs.\n- Plan for the next session: Review Mariana's CBT toolbox and coping cards, discuss any challenges or successes in implementing her relapse prevention plan, and celebrate her progress throughout therapy.",
