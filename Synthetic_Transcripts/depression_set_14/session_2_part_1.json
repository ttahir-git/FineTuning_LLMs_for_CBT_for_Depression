  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mariana, it's great to see you again for our second session. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last meeting. It's helpful to have that context as we continue our work together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few important things about our sessions. As an AI therapist, there are some limitations to keep in mind. I don't have access to any personal details or real-time information beyond what you share with me directly. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may not be entirely accurate, as AIs can sometimes generate content that isn't fully correct. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Finally, since our interaction is text-based, I can't observe or interpret any non-verbal cues. I wanted to make sure we're on the same page about these limitations as we move forward. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this.\n\nPatient: Thank you for explaining that, Nova. I understand the limitations and I'm comfortable continuing our sessions with that in mind. I don't have any questions about it at the moment.\n\nTherapist: Great, I appreciate your understanding, Mariana. Let's go ahead and set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to start by reviewing the thought record homework I assigned last time and discuss any patterns or insights that emerged from that. Then, we can dive deeper into the CBT framework, focusing on the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and begin exploring some of your specific thought patterns related to your depression. How does that sound for our plan today?",
