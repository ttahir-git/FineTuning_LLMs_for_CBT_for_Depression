  "transcript": "Therapist: Hello Mariana, it's great to see you for our 20th session today. Before we begin, I want to remind you that as an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in any way I can within these boundaries. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi Nova, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate you being upfront about them. I'm feeling a bit anxious about this being our last session, but overall, I'm doing well. I've been practicing the skills we've discussed, and I feel more equipped to handle my depression.\n\nTherapist: It's completely normal to feel anxious about ending therapy, and I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the skills we've worked on together. Before we dive into today's session, let's take a moment to check in. How have you been since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Since our last session, I've been focusing on implementing my relapse prevention plan and using the coping cards we created. I had a couple of rough days where my depression symptoms started to creep back in, but I was able to catch them early and use the strategies we discussed. It wasn't easy, but I feel proud of myself for managing it on my own.\n\nTherapist: That's fantastic, Mariana! Being able to recognize early warning signs and use your coping strategies independently is a huge accomplishment. It shows how much progress you've made in therapy. I'm proud of you too. Now, let's set an agenda for today's session. We have a few important topics to cover, including reviewing your CBT toolbox and coping cards, discussing any challenges or successes in implementing your relapse prevention plan, and celebrating your progress throughout therapy. Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?\n\nPatient: That covers the main points I wanted to discuss. I think it would also be helpful to talk about how I can continue to support myself after therapy ends, like you mentioned in the previous session summary.\n\nTherapist: Absolutely, discussing your plan for ongoing support is crucial. We can explore various options, such as leaning on your social support system, engaging in self-care activities, and considering periodic \"booster\" sessions if needed. Let's start by reviewing your CBT toolbox and coping cards. Can you share with me some of the tools and strategies you've found most helpful?",
