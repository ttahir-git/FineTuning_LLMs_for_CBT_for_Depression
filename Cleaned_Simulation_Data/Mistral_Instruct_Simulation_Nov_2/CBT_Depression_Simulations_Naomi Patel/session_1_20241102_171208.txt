Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's nice to meet you. I'm here to help you using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is a practical, problem-solving approach that helps you understand and change thought patterns that lead to harmful feelings and behaviors.

During our sessions, we'll work together to identify your negative thoughts and beliefs, understand their impact on your feelings and behaviors, and develop coping strategies to change them.

Let's start with some basic information. Could you tell me a bit more about what's been making you feel down lately? This will help us focus on specific issues and goals for our work together.

Patient: Sure, I've been feeling really overwhelmed with my graduate studies. The workload is intense, and I'm struggling to keep up with all the deadlines. Plus, being in a new city and trying to navigate my identity as non-binary has been really challenging. My family back home doesn't fully understand, which adds to the stress. I've also had a few instances of self-harm when things get too much.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your concerns, Naomi. It sounds like you are dealing with quite a few challenging issues. Let's focus on your graduate studies for now.

First, it's important to acknowledge the effort you've put into managing such a heavy workload and the stress that comes with it. It's common to feel overwhelmed in the face of multiple deadlines and a demanding coursework, especially during graduate studies.

Now let's work on developing some coping strategies to help you manage these stressors better.

1. Breaking down your tasks: Rather than looking at the entire workload at once, break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. This can help you feel more in control and less overwhelmed.

2. Setting priorities: Not all tasks are equally important. Identify which tasks need to be done immediately, and which can be done at a later time.

3. Time management: Use a planner or calendar to help you organize your time more effectively.

4. Seek support: Reach out to your professors or teaching assistants if you're struggling with a particular subject. They are there to help you succeed.

5. Self-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes, and that everyone faces challenges in their academic journey.

6. Self-care: Make sure to prioritize self-care. This could be taking breaks to do something you enjoy, practicing relaxation techniques, or getting regular exercise.

Now, let's move on to discussing your identity as non-binary. We can work on developing strategies to help you navigate these challenges and feel more supported in your new environment. Would that be alright with you?

Patient: Yes, that sounds good. I've been trying to break down my tasks, but sometimes it feels like no matter how small I make them, there's always more to do. I do use a planner, but I often feel guilty when I take breaks. I've reached out to a few professors, but I still feel like I'm falling behind.

As for my identity, it's been really tough. My family's conservative background makes it hard for them to understand, and I feel isolated at times. I've found some support in the LGBTQ+ community here, but it's still a daily struggle.
