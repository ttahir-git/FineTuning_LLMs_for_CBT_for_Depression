I apologize, but I don't see the conversation history from session 18 that you'd like me to summarize. Without the actual content of the therapy session, I cannot provide a meaningful summary of what was discussed, techniques used, or insights gained. 

If you'd like me to help summarize a therapy session, please provide the conversation details and I'll be happy to break it down according to:
1. Main topics discussed
2. Techniques/exercises used
3. Helpful elements
4. Homework assigned
5. Key insights
