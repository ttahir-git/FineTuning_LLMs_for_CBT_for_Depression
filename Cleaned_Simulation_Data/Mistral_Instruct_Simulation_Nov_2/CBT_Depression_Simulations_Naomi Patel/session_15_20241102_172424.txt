From our discussion, it seems that you've realized the importance of change taking time, the importance of proper timing and environment for difficult conversations, and that multiple approaches may be needed for family communication.

For today's session, let's focus on how the modified Self-Compassion Break is going and discuss any progress or challenges you've faced with family communication. We can also explore any other concerns or issues you'd like to address during our time together. How does that sound?

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to be back. I've been trying the simplified Self-Compassion Break, and it's been a bit easier to start with just one step. I've been focusing on saying "May I be kind to myself in this moment" when I feel overwhelmed. It's helping me pause and take a breath before reacting to stress.

As for the family communication strategies, I tried using "I" statements during our last conversation. It felt a bit awkward at first, but my mom seemed to listen more attentively. She didn't change her behavior right away, but I think she understood where I was coming from a little better. I'm trying to be patient and not expect immediate changes.

I do have a concern about my academic performance lately. The stress from balancing my studies, family, and identity is really taking a toll. I've been struggling to concentrate and meet deadlines. I'm worried that this might affect my grades and my ability to finish my thesis on time.
