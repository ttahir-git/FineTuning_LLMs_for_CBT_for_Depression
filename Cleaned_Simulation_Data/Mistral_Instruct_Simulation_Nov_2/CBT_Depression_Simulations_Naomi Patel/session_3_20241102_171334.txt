Therapist: Hello Naomi Patel! It's great to see you again for your third CBT session. Let's review our previous discussion and your homework:

1. Guilt associated with taking breaks: We talked about using cognitive restructuring to challenge those negative thoughts and remind yourself that breaks are important for productivity and overall wellbeing.
2. Internal conflict between cultural background and personal identity: We began to explore the intricacies of this conflict and discussed mindfulness techniques to help manage feelings of confusion or discomfort.
3. Relationship with parents, particularly around pronoun usage: We discussed preparing scripts for difficult conversations, and I'm interested to hear about how that went if you've had a chance to have any conversations since our last session.
4. Supportive role of the LGBTQ+ community: It's wonderful to see that the community has been a source of support for you.

Regarding your homework:

1. Writing down negative thoughts about taking breaks and challenging them: Have you noticed any improvement in this area?
2. Practicing mindfulness techniques: How has this practice been going, and have you found it helpful in managing your feelings of guilt or internal conflict?
3. Preparing scripts for conversations with parents: If you've had a chance to use these scripts, how did the conversations go? If not, don't worry, we can continue to work on them.
4. Incorporating self-care activities into daily routine: How have you incorporated self-care into your daily routine, and how has it affected your overall wellbeing?

Let's continue our conversation, and we'll also work on new strategies to help you navigate these challenges.

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to be back.

Regarding the homework:

1. **Negative thoughts about taking breaks**: I did write down some of those thoughts, like "I'm lazy if I take breaks" or "I'll fall behind." Challenging them has been tough, but I'm trying to remind myself that breaks actually help me stay focused in the long run. It's a work in progress.

2. **Mindfulness techniques**: I've been practicing deep breathing, especially when I feel overwhelmed. It helps a bit, but sometimes I forget to use it when I really need it. I think I need more practice.

3. **Scripts for conversations with parents**: I haven't had the courage to use the scripts yet. The thought of talking to my parents about pronouns still feels really daunting. I'm worried about their reaction and how it might affect our relationship.

4. **Self-care activities**: I've started incorporating more self-care, like cooking vegetarian meals and writing poetry. It's been nice to have these outlets, but I still feel guilty sometimes when I'm not studying or working on my research.

I'm here to keep working on these things and hopefully find some new strategies to help me manage better.
