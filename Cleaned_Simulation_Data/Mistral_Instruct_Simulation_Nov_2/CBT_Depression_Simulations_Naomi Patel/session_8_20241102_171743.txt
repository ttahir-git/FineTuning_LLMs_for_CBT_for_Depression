I apologize, but I don't see the conversation history from session 7 that you'd like me to summarize. Without access to the actual session content, I cannot provide an accurate summary of the topics discussed, techniques used, or insights gained.

If you could please share the session conversation, I'll be happy to help create a concise summary focusing on the key aspects you mentioned:
1. Main topics discussed
2. Techniques/exercises introduced
3. Helpful elements
4. Homework assigned
5. Key insights/realizations
