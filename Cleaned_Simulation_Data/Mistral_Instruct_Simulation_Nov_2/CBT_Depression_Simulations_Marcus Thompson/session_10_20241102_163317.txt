Therapist: Hello Marcus Thompson, it's great to see you again for session number 10! Let's discuss how you've been getting on with the homework and techniques we talked about in our last session.

Last time, we discussed breaking down mindfulness practice into smaller, manageable chunks, and I'm curious to know if you've noticed any improvements in your ability to maintain this practice despite your busy schedule. How have things been going with the 5-minute mindfulness sessions you've been integrating into your daily routine?

We also talked about identifying and tracking irritability triggers at work, and I'd love to hear about any patterns you've noticed. It's essential to understand what triggers your irritability so we can work together to develop strategies for managing those triggers more effectively.

I remember we also discussed journaling about your thoughts and feelings, as well as practicing reframing those thoughts to be more positive. Has this exercise helped you to shift your perspective on the challenges you face at work?

Last but not least, we discussed the importance of practicing self-compassion. How have you been incorporating self-compassion exercises into your daily life, and have you noticed any benefits from doing so?

Overall, it's essential to acknowledge the progress you've made, as well as any challenges you may have encountered. Together, we can continue to work on strategies to help you manage stress, irritability, and the systemic issues you face in education.

Looking forward to our discussion!

Patient: Hey, Nova. Thanks for checking in. Let's dive into these points.

First off, the 5-minute mindfulness sessions have been a game-changer. I've been doing them in the morning before my first class and sometimes during my lunch break. It's surprising how much of a difference those few minutes make. I feel more grounded and less reactive during the day.

As for tracking irritability triggers, I've noticed that it spikes when I'm dealing with students who are struggling with personal issues, like family problems or gang involvement. It's hard not to take their struggles personally, thinking I should be doing more to help them.

Journaling has been eye-opening. I've started to see patterns in my thoughts, especially around feeling like a failure when I can't solve every student's problem. Reframing those thoughts has been tough but helpful. I'm trying to remind myself that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that I'm doing my best.

Self-compassion exercises are still a work in progress. I've been using some of the techniques you suggested, like talking to myself the way I'd talk to a friend. It feels a bit strange at first, but I can see how it could be beneficial over time.

Overall, I feel like I'm making progress, but there are still moments when I get caught up in the whirlwind
