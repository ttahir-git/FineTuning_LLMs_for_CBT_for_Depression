Therapist: Hello Marcus Thompson, it's great to see you again for our 11th CBT session! Based on our last session summary, it seems that you're making progress with your 5-minute mindfulness practice, identifying and tracking irritability triggers at work, journaling, and thought reframing exercises. That's wonderful!

In this session, let's continue to build on that progress and discuss some ways to improve your self-compassion practice and emotional boundaries with your students' problems. We'll also review your homework from last week and set some new goals for this week.

1. Self-compassion practice: I understand that self-compassion feels unusual but potentially beneficial. To help make it feel more natural, try to think about self-compassion as talking to a friend who is going through a difficult time. How would you speak to a friend in your situation? Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding.

2. Emotional boundaries: It's important to recognize that while you want to help your students, it's essential to maintain boundaries to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Consider setting specific office hours or designating a certain time to address student issues. This can help you focus on your work and personal life more effectively.

3. Reframe negative self-talk: When negative thoughts arise, practice thought reframing by challenging those thoughts and replacing them with more helpful, realistic alternatives. For example, instead of thinking, "I'm a failure because I can't help every student," reframe it as, "I did my best, and I can continue to look for solutions to help this student."

Let's take some time now to discuss your homework assignments and set new goals for this week. How about we start there? Looking forward to our session!

Patient: Hey, Nova. Thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to be back.

I've been trying to practice self-compassion, but it still feels a bit awkward. When I think about talking to a friend in my situation, I'd probably say something like, "You're doing your best, and that's enough. It's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes." But when it comes to myself, I struggle to say those things. It's like I'm waiting for someone else to give me that reassurance.

As for emotional boundaries, I've been trying to set specific times to address student issues, but it's tough. My students often need help outside of regular office hours, and I feel guilty turning them away. I guess I need to find a balance that doesn't completely shut them out but also gives me some space.

Let's talk about the homework. I've been keeping up with the mindfulness and journaling, and I think they're helping. I've noticed some patterns in my negative self-talk, especially around feeling like I'm not doing enough for my students. I've been trying to reframe those thoughts, but it's a work in progress.

So, what new goals do you have in mind for this week?

Therapist: That's a great observation, Marcus. Regarding self-compassion, it can feel challenging to speak to ourselves in the same way we would to a friend, but remember, the goal is to foster a kinder and more understanding inner voice.

To make progress, I suggest setting aside specific times during your day for self-compassion practice. It can be as simple as taking a break to remind yourself that you are doing your best and that it's okay to make mistakes. You might also try writing down some positive affirmations about yourself and reading them when you feel overwhelmed or self-critical.

Regarding emotional boundaries, it's essential to find a balance that allows you to support your students while also preserving your energy for yourself and other aspects of your life. One approach could be to establish clear communication with your students about when you're available to help, and encourage them to make appointments or arrange a specific time to discuss their issues.

For homework this week, I encourage you to:

1. Continue your mindfulness and journaling practice, focusing on becoming more aware of negative self-talk patterns and identifying areas for thought reframing.
2. Set aside designated times each day for self-compassion practice, using affirmations or kind self-talk to counteract negative thoughts and feelings.
3. Experiment with setting clear emotional boundaries by communicating your office hours to students and encouraging them to schedule appointments.
4. Reflect on any instances where you struggled to maintain emotional boundaries and consider potential strategies for navigating those situations in the future.

Remember, progress may be slow, and it's essential to be patient with yourself as you work towards building new habits. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the suggestions. Setting aside specific times for self-compassion practice sounds like a good idea. I'll try to do that and see how it feels.

For the emotional boundaries, I'll definitely work on communicating my office hours more clearly to my students. I think having a set schedule will help both them and me.

I'll keep up with the mindfulness and journaling, focusing on those negative self-talk patterns. It's been eye-opening to see how often those thoughts pop up.

I'll also reflect on any struggles with emotional boundaries and think about strategies to handle those situations better.

Looking forward to our next session and seeing how these practices evolve. Thanks for the guidance, Nova.
