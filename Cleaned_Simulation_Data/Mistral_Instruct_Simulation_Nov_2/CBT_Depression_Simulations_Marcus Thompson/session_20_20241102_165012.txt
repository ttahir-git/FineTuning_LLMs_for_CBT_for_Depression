Let me summarize this therapy session (Session #19):

Main Topics Discussed:
- Progress review of previously assigned techniques
- Challenges with mindful eating and stress eating
- Boundary setting with students through office hours
- Coping with caregiving responsibilities

Techniques/Exercises Discussed:
- Diaphragmatic breathing (reported as very helpful)
- Quick 10-minute morning workouts
- Using the mantra "I am doing my best, and that is enough"
- Setting office hours

Things That Appeared Helpful:
- Diaphragmatic breathing during morning commute
- Morning exercise routine providing energy boost
- Using the mantra for managing perfectionist tendencies
- The structured recap at the beginning of session

Challenges Identified:
- Difficulty maintaining boundaries with students
- Continued struggle with late-night stress eating
- Emotional eating connected to comfort food (mother's sweet potato pie)

The session revealed good progress with some techniques (breathing, exercise, mantra) while highlighting ongoing challenges with boundary-setting and emotional eating. The client showed self-awareness and openness about areas needing more work.

Note: The session appears to have been cut off before the therapist could respond to the question about mindful eating strategies.
