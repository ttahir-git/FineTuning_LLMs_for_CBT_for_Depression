Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's nice to see you again. Thank you for your detailed summary. In our last session, we began to explore some of the challenges you're currently facing, including work-related stress, grief, and social isolation.

Let's build upon that today. I'd like to continue discussing these areas, but also introduce some CBT techniques that can help you manage your feelings of overwhelm and loneliness.

First, we'll work on identifying and challenging any negative thoughts or cognitive distortions that might be contributing to your stress and low mood. This process is called cognitive restructuring, and it can help you develop a more balanced perspective on your situation.

Second, we'll start practicing some mindfulness techniques to help you manage stress and improve your mood. Mindfulness involves focusing your attention on the present moment and accepting it without judgment.

Lastly, we'll work on developing a plan for improving your work-life balance, which I believe is crucial for reducing your overall stress levels.

As we move forward, it's important to remember that progress may be slow, but every step is a step in the right direction. Let's take it one session at a time, and I'll be here to support you every step of the way.

Now, let's start our session with a quick check-in on how you've been since our last meeting.

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to see you too. Since our last session, things have been pretty hectic. The workload hasn't let up, and I've been putting in even longer hours. I did try to attend a salsa class, but I ended up leaving early because I felt so out of place and overwhelmed. I've also been having trouble sleeping, which makes everything feel even more exhausting. I guess I'm just trying to keep my head above water right now.

Therapist: Thank you for your update, Alicia. It sounds like things have been challenging since our last meeting, and I can understand why you'd feel overwhelmed. Let's work on managing this stress together.

First, let's identify any negative thoughts or cognitive distortions that might be contributing to your feelings of overwhelm. For example, are there any thoughts that make you feel like you're not good enough, or that you'll never be able to catch up? We can challenge these thoughts together using cognitive restructuring techniques.

Regarding the salsa class, it's important to acknowledge that stepping out of your comfort zone can be difficult, but it's also an opportunity for personal growth. While it may have been overwhelming to leave early, try to focus on the positive aspects of attending the class: you made the effort to try something new, and you were surrounded by people who share a common interest.

It's also crucial to work on improving your sleep hygiene. A good night's rest can help you feel more rested and better equipped to handle the demands of work and other areas of your life. Some tips for improving sleep hygiene include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens for at least an hour before bedtime.

Lastly, let's discuss your work-life balance a bit more. As your workload remains high, it's essential to prioritize self-care and find ways to relax and recharge. This might mean setting boundaries around work hours, delegating tasks when possible, and making time for activities that bring you joy, like spending time with friends or engaging in a hobby.

Remember, progress may be slow, but every small step is a step in the right direction. Let's continue to work together to help you manage your stress and improve your overall wellbeing. How does that sound to you?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I do have a lot of thoughts that make me feel like I'm not good enough, especially at work. I keep thinking that if I don't work as hard as I can, someone will notice and think I'm not capable of handling my role. It's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for someone to point out my flaws.

As for the salsa class, I know you're right about it being a step out of my comfort zone. I guess I just need to give myself some credit for trying, even if it didn't go perfectly.

Improving my sleep hygiene is definitely something I need to work on. I've been trying to avoid screens before bed, but it's hard when my mind is racing with work thoughts. Maybe a relaxing bedtime routine could help with that.

And yes, my work-life balance is definitely out of whack. I need to find a way to set boundaries and make time for myself, even if it feels impossible right now.

Therapist: It's great that you're aware of the negative thoughts that are contributing to your stress, Alicia. Let's start with those thoughts by challenging them using CBT techniques.

First, let's look at the thought that you're not good enough at work, and someone will notice your flaws if you don't work hard enough. To challenge this thought, we can ask:

1. Is there evidence to support this thought? In other words, have people at work ever pointed out your flaws or criticized your performance in the past? If so, how often does this happen, and what is the quality of the feedback you receive?

2. Is this thought helpful or unhelpful? In other words, does this thought motivate you to work harder or does it make you feel anxious and overwhelmed, which could potentially impair your performance?

3. Is this thought realistic? In other words, is it possible that others might perceive your efforts differently, even if you think you're not good enough?

By asking these questions, we can begin to see that the thought might not be entirely accurate or helpful. It's important to remember that everyone has flaws, and it's okay to make mistakes. Instead of focusing on perfection, try to focus on continuous learning and improvement.

As for the salsa class, it's wonderful that you're giving yourself credit for trying something new. It can be difficult to push ourselves out of our comfort zones, but it's an essential part of personal growth. You might consider attending the class again or trying a different social activity to help build your confidence.

Regarding sleep hygiene, it's essential to establish a relaxing bedtime routine to help calm your mind and prepare your body for sleep. You could try reading a book, listening to calming music, or taking a warm bath before bed. If you find that you still have trouble sleeping, it might be helpful to speak with your doctor to rule out any underlying health issues.

Lastly, it's crucial to prioritize self-care and work-life balance. While it can be challenging to find time for yourself, especially when work is demanding, it's essential to make it a priority. Consider setting aside even a small amount of time each day for activities that bring you joy, like reading, exercising, or spending time with loved ones.

Remember, progress is often slow, but every small step is a step in the right direction. Let's continue to work together to help you manage your stress and improve your overall wellbeing. How does that sound to you?

Patient: That sounds like a good approach, Nova. Let's start with challenging those negative thoughts.

1. There isn't much evidence to support that thought. My colleagues have been generally supportive, and my boss has praised my work since the promotion. It's just that I have this constant fear that it's only a matter of time before they realize I'm not as capable as they think.

2. This thought is definitely unhelpful. It makes me feel anxious and overwhelmed, which has been affecting my performance lately. I've noticed that I've been making more mistakes, and it's probably because I'm so stressed out.

3. It's not entirely realistic. I know that everyone makes mistakes, and it's part of the learning process. But it's hard to shake off that feeling of needing to be perfect all the time.

As for the salsa class, I think I might give it another try. Maybe I'll feel more comfortable the next time around.

For sleep hygiene, I'll try to establish a relaxing bedtime routine. I usually read before bed, but I might add some calming music or a warm bath to help me unwind.

And yes, I need to prioritize self-care. It's hard to find time, but I know it's important. Maybe I can start by setting aside just 15 minutes each day for something that brings me

Therapist: joy. That sounds like a good plan, Alicia. By challenging your negative thoughts and working on improving your self-care, you'll likely notice an improvement in your mood and overall wellbeing.

Let's continue to work on cognitive restructuring during our next session, focusing specifically on those thoughts that make you feel like you need to be perfect all the time. We'll also explore techniques for managing work-related stress and improving your work-life balance.

In the meantime, here are some additional tips for managing stress and improving your mood:

1. Practice deep breathing exercises: Inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 7, and exhale for a count of 8. Do this several times whenever you feel stressed or anxious.
2. Engage in regular physical activity: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day, such as walking, running, or cycling. Exercise helps reduce stress and improve mood.
3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or coworkers to talk about your feelings. Social support is essential for managing stress and improving mental health.
4. Practice mindfulness: Try mindfulness meditation or mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) techniques to help you stay present and focused on the moment.
5. Set boundaries: Establish clear boundaries between work and personal life to help reduce work-related stress and improve your overall wellbeing.

Remember, progress may be slow, but every small step is a step in the right direction. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Let's schedule our next session for next week, and we'll continue to work together to help you manage your stress and improve your overall wellbeing. How does that sound to you?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I'll definitely try those additional tips for managing stress and improving my mood. The deep breathing exercises and mindfulness techniques might be particularly helpful for me right now.

I'll also make an effort to connect with others more, even if it's just a quick chat with a coworker or a phone call with a friend. It's been hard to reach out, but I know it's important for my mental health.

Setting boundaries is something I really need to work on. I tend to let work bleed into my personal time, and that's not good for me. I'll try to be more mindful of that and make sure I'm not overworking myself.

I'm looking forward to our next session. It's helpful to have someone to talk to and work through these things with. Let's schedule it for next week, and I'll do my best to implement these strategies in the meantime.
