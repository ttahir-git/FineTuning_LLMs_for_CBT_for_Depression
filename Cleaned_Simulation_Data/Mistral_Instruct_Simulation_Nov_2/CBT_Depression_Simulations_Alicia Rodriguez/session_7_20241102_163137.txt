I hear how much pressure you're feeling in your role as team lead, and it's clear that you take your responsibilities very seriously. It's admirable that you want to do well, but it's also important to recognize that taking care of yourself actually makes you a better leader in the long run.

I'm so sorry about your grandmother. It's completely understandable that you're still grieving, and six months isn't a very long time when it comes to processing the loss of someone we love. Can you tell me more about what you mean when you say you're "not really dealing with it"? What comes up for you when you think about your grandmother?

Let's take some time to talk about this, if you'd like. Grief is a complex process, and sometimes we push it aside because we're trying to stay strong or because we're overwhelmed with other responsibilities. But it's important to give ourselves permission to feel and process these emotions.

Therapist: Hello Alicia, nice to see you again for our 7th session. Let's continue our discussion about managing pressure at work and dealing with grief.

First, let's talk about the pressure you're feeling as a team lead. Remember, it's okay to ask for help when things get tough. Delegating tasks to your team can help lighten the load and empower your team members. By doing so, you're demonstrating trust and promoting a healthy work environment.

Secondly, regarding your grief over your grandmother, I'm here to support you. It's normal to feel a range of emotions, and there's no right or wrong way to grieve. If you're "not really dealing with it," it could be helpful to explore those feelings more deeply.

We can work on identifying thoughts and feelings that come up when you think about your grandmother. Sometimes, writing down these thoughts can help make them more manageable. We can also discuss coping strategies, such as expressing your feelings through art, music, or journaling, or seeking support from friends, family, or a grief support group.

If you're open to it, we can spend today's session focusing on these topics. How does that sound to you?

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to see you too.

About delegating tasks, I've tried that a bit, but it's hard for me to let go. I feel like if I don't do it myself, it won't be done right. I know that's not fair to my team, but it's hard to shake that feeling.

As for my grandmother, I think about her a lot, especially when I'm alone at night. I feel guilty for not being able to visit her more often when she was alive. I keep thinking, "What if I had done more?" It's hard to move past those thoughts.

Writing things down does sound like a good idea. I've never really done that before, but maybe it could help. How exactly would I start?
