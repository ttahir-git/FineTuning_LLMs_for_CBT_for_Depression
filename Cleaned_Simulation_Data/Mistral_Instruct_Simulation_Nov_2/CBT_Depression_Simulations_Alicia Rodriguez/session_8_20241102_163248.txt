I understand your hesitation about delegating. That need for control often comes from a place of wanting to ensure quality, but it can become overwhelming. Could you tell me more about what specifically worries you when you think about letting others handle tasks? Maybe we can work on building trust gradually.

What you're sharing about your grandmother - those feelings of guilt and regret - are very common in grief. But they can be really painful to carry. When you think "What if I had done more?" what specific memories or moments come to mind? 

As for writing, we can start simple. Try keeping a small notebook by your bed, and when those nighttime thoughts about your grandmother come, just write them down. Don't worry about structure or grammar - just let your thoughts flow. You might write about memories, feelings, or even letters to her. Would you be willing to try that this week?

Remember, both learning to delegate and processing grief take time. We can work on these challenges step by step.

Therapist: Hello Alicia Rodriguez, it's great to see you again for our 8th CBT session. Let's dive into the topics we discussed last time.

Regarding delegating tasks, it's understandable to feel a sense of control over the quality of the work. However, if this is causing you stress, we might want to explore strategies to help you build trust in others and alleviate that burden. Could you share more about your concerns when you consider delegating tasks? I believe we can develop a plan to help you overcome this gradually.

Your feelings of guilt and regret after losing your grandmother are typical of the grieving process, but they can be incredibly challenging to manage. When you find yourself thinking "What if I had done more?", could you share some specific moments or memories that come to mind? It may help to process and understand these feelings better.

Regarding writing, we can start with small, manageable steps to help you cope with your thoughts and feelings. I encourage you to keep a small notebook by your bed, and when those nighttime thoughts about your grandmother come up, simply write them down without worrying too much about structure or grammar. Write about your memories, feelings, or even write letters to her. This exercise can help you release these emotions and provide a sense of closure. Would you be willing to try this for the upcoming week?

Remember, both learning to delegate effectively and processing grief are processes that require patience and time. We will work through these challenges step by step. If you have any other thoughts or concerns, feel free to share them!

Patient: Hi, Nova. Thanks for the reminder about delegating tasks. It's not just about the quality of work; it's more about feeling like I'm the only one who can do it right. I worry that if I delegate, things might go wrong, and I'll be blamed. It's like I'm carrying this invisible weight of responsibility.

As for my grandmother, there are so many "what ifs" that haunt me. One moment that keeps coming back is the last time I spoke to her. I was so caught up in work that I didn't realize how sick she was. I keep thinking, "What if I had visited more often?" or "What if I had called her more?" It's like I'm punishing myself for not being there enough.

I'll try the writing exercise, but I'm not sure if it will help. I've never been good at expressing my feelings on paper. But I'll give it a shot.

Therapist: I understand your concerns about delegating tasks. It's natural to feel responsible and want to ensure everything is done perfectly. However, it's essential to remember that you are not alone, and others can help you accomplish tasks effectively.

When it comes to your feelings of guilt about your grandmother, remember that it's normal to have "what if" thoughts during the grieving process. It's essential to acknowledge these feelings but not dwell on them too much. The writing exercise might help you release those feelings, even if expressing them on paper is challenging.

To make the writing exercise more manageable, you might want to start by writing short, simple sentences or bullet points about your thoughts and feelings. Over time, you can build up to more detailed entries as you become more comfortable. The goal is to provide an outlet for your emotions and promote self-reflection, which can be therapeutic in itself.

As we continue our sessions, I'd be happy to work with you on strategies to overcome your fears about delegating tasks and help you process your grief in a healthier way. If you have any other thoughts or concerns, please feel free to share them!

Patient: Thanks for the tips on the writing exercise. I'll try starting with short sentences and see how it goes. It's just hard to put those feelings into words.

As for delegating, I guess I need to trust my team more. I know they're capable, but I'm always worried about the consequences if something goes wrong. Maybe I can start by delegating smaller tasks and see how it goes. It's a step-by-step process, right?

I'm still struggling with the guilt about my grandmother. It's like a constant loop in my mind. I know it's normal, but it's so hard to let go.

Therapist: You're doing well, Alicia, by acknowledging that you need to trust your team more and start with smaller tasks to ease into delegation. That's a great approach.

Regarding the writing exercise, it's okay if putting your feelings into words feels challenging at first. Remember, there's no right or wrong way to do it. The goal is to create an outlet for your emotions and thoughts. As you become more comfortable, you may find it easier to express yourself.

About the guilt you're experiencing about your grandmother, it's essential to remember that the grieving process is unique to each person, and there's no "right" or "wrong" way to grieve. While it may be difficult, try focusing on the memories you shared with her and the love you had for her rather than dwelling on the "what ifs." It might help to write about those positive memories during your writing exercise.

As we continue our sessions, we can work together to find additional strategies to help you process your grief and build trust in your team. If you have any other thoughts or concerns, please feel free to share them!

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'll focus on writing about the positive memories with my grandmother. It might help to shift my focus a bit.

As for delegating, I'll start with smaller tasks and see how it goes. I just need to remind myself that it's okay to let go of some control. It's a work in progress, but I'll take it one step at a time.

I appreciate your support. It helps to have someone to talk to about all this.
