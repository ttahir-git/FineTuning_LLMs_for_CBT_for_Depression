Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's nice to meet you. I'm here to help you using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is a practical, action-oriented therapy that aims to help you understand and manage your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

Over the course of our sessions, we will work together to identify and challenge negative thought patterns, and learn coping skills to improve your mood. We'll also explore how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are related and how to make positive changes in your life.

To get started, can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing and how it's been affecting you?

Patient: Sure. Lately, I've been feeling really overwhelmed. I was promoted at work, which should be a good thing, but it's just added more pressure. I feel like I have to prove myself constantly, especially since I'm one of the few women in a leadership role. The job promotion has made me work even longer hours, and I'm finding it hard to concentrate. I've also been feeling really lonely since my grandmother passed away. She was my main support system, and now I feel like I'm drifting. I've been canceling social plans and just staying home, which isn't helping.
