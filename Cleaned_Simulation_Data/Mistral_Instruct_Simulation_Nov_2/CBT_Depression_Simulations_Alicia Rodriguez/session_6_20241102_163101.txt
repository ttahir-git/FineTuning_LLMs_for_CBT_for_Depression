Therapist: Hello Alicia, nice to see you again! It seems that there was an error with our session last time. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. I'm here to help you as best I can, so let's continue with our CBT session.

To refresh your memory, last time we discussed some of the things that have been bothering you, and we started working on some cognitive behavioral techniques to help you manage those issues. Can you tell me how things have been going for you since our last session? Have you been able to practice the techniques we discussed, and if so, what has that been like for you?

Patient: Yeah, I've been trying to practice those techniques, but it's been tough. I still find myself working late a lot, even though I know it's not good for me. I've been trying to take short breaks during the day, but it feels like I'm just procrastinating. And I haven't really been able to cut back on the caffeine, so I'm still feeling really tired all the time.

Therapist: I understand that it can be difficult to make changes, especially when they go against habits that we've developed over time. It's great that you're making an effort to practice the techniques we discussed, even if it feels challenging at times.

Regarding your work schedule, it's important to find a balance that works for you. Working long hours can be detrimental to both your physical and mental health, and it's essential to prioritize self-care in order to maintain your overall well-being.

Taking short breaks throughout the day is a good start, and I encourage you to continue with this practice. You could try setting a timer to remind yourself to take a short break every hour or so, and use that time to stretch, take a walk, or simply close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. This can help to rejuvenate your mind and body and make you more focused when you return to work.

Regarding caffeine, it's true that excessive consumption can contribute to feelings of fatigue and anxiety. I encourage you to consider gradually reducing your caffeine intake, perhaps by cutting back on your daily intake by one or two cups each week. This can help to reduce your dependence on caffeine and improve your sleep quality, which in turn can help you to feel more energized during the day.

Lastly, I want to remind you that it's okay if you don't get it right every time. Progress is often slow and incremental, and it's important to be patient with yourself as you work to make changes. Let's continue to work together to find strategies that work for you, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?

Patient: Thanks for the encouragement. I guess I just feel like I need to keep pushing myself because I don't want to let anyone down, especially with my new role as team lead. But I know you're right about the balance thing. I'll try to set those timers for breaks and see if I can cut back on the caffeine a bit more. 

I've also been thinking a lot about my grandma lately. It's been almost six months since she passed, and I still feel like I'm not really dealing with it. I just keep pushing it aside, but it feels like it's always there, lurking in the background.
