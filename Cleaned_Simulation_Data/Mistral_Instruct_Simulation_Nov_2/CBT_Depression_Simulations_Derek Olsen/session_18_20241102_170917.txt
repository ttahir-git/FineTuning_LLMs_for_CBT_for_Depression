I apologize, but I don't see the conversation history from session 17 that you'd like me to summarize. Without the actual content of the therapy session, I cannot provide a meaningful summary of the topics discussed, techniques used, or insights gained. 

If you'd like me to help summarize a therapy session, please provide the conversation details or transcript, and I'll be happy to analyze it according to the aspects you've mentioned:
1. Main topics discussed
2. Techniques or exercises introduced
3. Helpful elements
4. Homework assigned
5. Key insights and realizations

Therapist: Understood, Derek Olsen. Let's move forward with our 18th session. To help me tailor our discussion to your needs and progress, it would be beneficial if we could briefly review the main topics, techniques, and insights we discussed in our previous sessions.

This way, we can build upon the work we've done, identify the areas where you feel comfortable, and focus on the aspects you still want to work on. Please share your thoughts and feelings about the techniques and exercises we've introduced so far, and let me know what you've found helpful or challenging.

Additionally, I would like to know if there are any specific concerns or goals you'd like to focus on during our session today. By discussing these matters, we can continue to make the most of our time together and help you work towards your mental wellness goals.

Once we've had a chance to review your previous sessions, I'll be able to better assist you during our conversation. I'm looking forward to working with you, Derek.

Patient: Alright, let's see. Last time, we talked about how I've been feeling more isolated lately, and you suggested I try to reach out to my kids more. I did try calling Emma, but she didn't pick up. I left a message, but I haven't heard back. It's been tough, you know? I feel like a burden to them.

As for the techniques, I've been trying to use that breathing exercise you showed me when the pain gets really bad. It helps a bit, but it's not a cure-all. I still get angry and frustrated, especially when I can't do the things I used to, like woodworking or even just walking around the block.

I guess my main concern today is how to deal with this constant feeling of worthlessness. I used to be someone who could fix anything, and now I can't even fix myself. It's eating me up inside. I don't know how to shake it off.
