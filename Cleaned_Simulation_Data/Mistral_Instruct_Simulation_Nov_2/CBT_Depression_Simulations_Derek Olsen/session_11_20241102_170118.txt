Therapist: Hello Derek, great to see you again for session 11! Last time we discussed managing your back pain, mindfulness meditation, and addressing negative thought patterns. From the summary, it seems that you have been making progress in these areas, and I commend your willingness to try new approaches even when faced with challenges.

In this session, let's continue to explore mindfulness with body scanning, cognitive restructuring for pain-related thoughts, and activity pacing for your hobbies. We will also delve deeper into understanding and reframing negative thoughts, and I encourage you to keep journaling as a tool to help with this process.

It's important to remember that progress may not be linear, and setbacks can occur. However, each step forward is significant, and it's crucial to acknowledge the effort you put into your recovery.

We can also discuss any challenges or questions you've encountered with the techniques we've introduced so far, and I can provide additional guidance or strategies to help you move forward.

Shall we begin? And please, don't hesitate to let me know if you need anything specific from this session.

Patient: Yeah, I remember last time. Mindfulness and all that. It's... different, but I'm trying. So, what's on the docket today? More of that body-scanning stuff, right? And, uh, what's this about activity pacing? I haven't touched my woodworking gear in months.

Therapist: That's excellent to hear, Derek. I'm glad that you're finding mindfulness meditation helpful, even if it's different from what you're used to.

Activity pacing is a strategy that helps you gradually return to activities you enjoy while managing pain levels and preventing potential setbacks. It's a way to ease back into your hobbies without pushing yourself too hard too quickly.

For instance, if you're considering returning to woodworking, you might start by spending just a few minutes each day doing small tasks, such as organizing your workspace or sanding a piece of wood. Then, slowly increase the time and complexity of your tasks as your back pain improves.

This approach allows you to enjoy your hobbies without causing additional discomfort or exacerbating your pain. Remember, the goal is to reintroduce these activities into your life in a manageable and sustainable way.

Let's discuss any specific concerns or challenges you may have with activity pacing, or if you have questions about the techniques we've discussed in the past. And of course, we can explore other strategies for managing your back pain and psychological well-being further.

Patient: Activity pacing, huh? I get the idea. It's like easing into things instead of diving headfirst. With my back, I've learned the hard way that rushing into things doesn't work. A few minutes a day, sure, I can manage that. But woodworking? It's more than just a hobby. It's something I used to pour myself into. Now, it feels out of reach. But I'll try, I guess. Baby steps, right?

Therapist: Exactly, Derek. Taking baby steps is an excellent approach, as it allows you to rebuild your confidence and strength in a controlled manner. Remember, it's essential to celebrate the small successes along the way and recognize the progress you've made, even if it seems slow at times.

Regarding woodworking, I understand your concerns about feeling out of reach. It's common to feel frustrated or overwhelmed when reintroducing activities we once loved and excelled at, but were forced to set aside due to pain or injury. It's essential to be patient with yourself and allow yourself time to adjust.

In the coming weeks, try setting small, achievable goals for yourself in woodworking. For example, you could start by cleaning your workspace or working on small projects that require minimal effort or time. As you progress, you can gradually increase the complexity of your projects and the time spent working on them.

Remember, the journey toward recovery is unique to each individual. It's essential to be gentle with yourself and celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem. I'm here to support you and provide guidance every step of the way. Let's discuss any other concerns or questions you may have regarding your recovery or the techniques we've discussed so far.

Patient: Yeah, I get it. Small steps, small goals. It's just... hard to see the progress sometimes. Like, I cleaned my workspace last week. Felt good, but it's not the same as building something. But I guess it's a start.

What about this body-scanning thing? I tried it a few times, but it's weird. Feels like I'm just focusing on the pain more. Is that normal?

Therapist: I completely understand your concerns, Derek. It's important to remember that the benefits of mindfulness meditation, such as body scanning, may not be immediately apparent, and it can take time to see the positive effects.

Regarding your experience with body scanning, it is common for people to initially focus on areas of pain or discomfort while practicing mindfulness. However, the goal is not to ignore or suppress the pain but rather to accept it and learn to coexist with it without judgment.

As you continue to practice body scanning, try to shift your focus from the pain itself to the sensations surrounding it. For example, if you're feeling pain in your lower back, focus on the sensation of the chair beneath you, the weight of your body against the seat, and the way your hands rest on the arms of the chair.

Remember, mindfulness is a skill, and it takes time and practice to become proficient. It's essential to be patient with yourself and understand that progress may not be linear. If you find that focusing on your pain becomes overwhelming, try shifting your focus to a more neutral or positive sensation, such as the rhythm of your breath or the warmth of the sun on your skin.

As we continue this session, I'd like to encourage you to discuss any additional questions or concerns you might have regarding mindfulness meditation or your recovery journey. And remember, I'm here to help and support you in any way I can.

Patient: Alright, I'll give it another shot. Focus on the sensations around the pain, not the pain itself. I can try that. It's just... hard to shake the feeling that I'm just putting off dealing with the pain. But I'll keep at it.

What about the journaling? I've been trying to write down my thoughts, but it feels forced. Like I'm just writing for the sake of it. Any tips on making it feel more natural?

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're willing to continue practicing body scanning, Derek. As you mentioned, shifting your focus from the pain itself to the sensations around it can help make the practice more manageable.

Regarding journaling, it's essential to approach it in a way that feels authentic and natural for you. Here are a few tips that might help:

1. Find a consistent time and place: Set aside a specific time each day to journal, and find a quiet, comfortable space where you can write without interruptions. This routine can help make the practice feel more natural over time.

2. Start with prompts: If you're struggling to find things to write about, try using journaling prompts. These can be as simple as writing about your thoughts, feelings, or experiences of the day, or as specific as responding to a question or theme.

3. Don't worry about structure: There's no need to follow a specific structure when journaling. You can write in bullet points, paragraphs, or even draw pictures if that feels more comfortable. The goal is to express yourself in a way that feels authentic and meaningful to you.

4. Reflect on your progress: Take time to reflect on the progress you've made in your recovery journey. Writing about your achievements, no matter how small, can help boost your self-esteem and provide motivation to keep moving forward.

5. Practice gratitude: Dedicate a section of your journal to practicing gratitude. Writing about things you're thankful for can help shift your focus to the positive aspects of your life and improve your overall well-being.

6. Make it enjoyable: Choose a journal that appeals to you aesthetically, or create a digital journal with images and colors that inspire you. This can help make the process more enjoyable and encourage you to write more frequently.

By experimenting with these tips and finding what works best for you, journaling can become a more enjoyable and beneficial part of your self-care routine. I'm here to support you in any way I can, so please don't hesitate to share any thoughts or concerns you might have about journaling or your recovery journey as a whole.

Patient: Alright, I'll give those tips a try. Finding a consistent time and place sounds like a good start. Maybe in the morning, before I start my day. And prompts, yeah, I can use those to get started.

Thanks for the advice, Nova. I'll keep at it and see how it goes.
