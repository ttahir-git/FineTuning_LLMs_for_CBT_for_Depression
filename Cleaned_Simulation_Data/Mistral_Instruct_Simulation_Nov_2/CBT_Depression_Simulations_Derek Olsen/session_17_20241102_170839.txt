Session Summary:

1. Main topics discussed:
- Review of previous work on negative thoughts and cognitive distortions
- Challenges with journaling practice
- Difficulties with mindfulness meditation due to physical pain
- Connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors

2. Techniques/exercises discussed:
- Thought journaling
- Evidence-based thought challenging
- Mindfulness meditation with breathing focus

3. Helpful/Important elements:
- Client showing increased awareness of thought patterns
- Recognition of the connection between thoughts and behaviors
- Some engagement with homework despite challenges
- Honest feedback about what's working and what isn't

4. Previous homework discussed:
- Thought journaling (completed but finding it repetitive)
- Mindfulness practice (attempted but challenging due to physical pain)

5. Key insights/realizations:
- Acknowledgment that negative thoughts are distortions ("brain playing tricks")
- Recognition that physical pain is a significant barrier to mindfulness practice
- Understanding of thought-feeling-behavior connections
- Some frustration with repetitive nature of thought work, suggesting need for new approaches or modifications

The session revealed both progress in understanding cognitive concepts and practical challenges in implementing techniques, particularly due to physical pain. This suggests a need to adapt mindfulness approaches to accommodate physical limitations and possibly refresh the thought journaling approach to maintain engagement.
