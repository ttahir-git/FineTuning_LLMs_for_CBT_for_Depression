Patient: Hey, Nova. Yeah, I've been trying the body scanning and journaling. It's not easy, but I'm doing it. The body scanning, it's weird. I'm focusing on the areas around the pain, like you said. It's helping a bit, but it's slow.

Journaling, I'm sticking to it. I set a time every morning, just like you suggested. It's helping me clear my head a bit, but I still get frustrated. I'm writing down my thoughts, but sometimes it feels like I'm just going in circles.

As for the woodworking, I cleaned up the workspace like we talked about. It felt good to get that done. I haven't tried any actual work yet, just the cleanup. I'm still not sure about diving back in, but I'm thinking about it.

I guess my main frustration is that it feels like I'm not making enough progress. I know you said it's a gradual process, but it's hard to see the small steps sometimes. Any ideas on how to handle that frustration better?

Therapist: I completely understand how you feel, Derek. It's natural to want to see progress quickly, but recovery can be a slow and frustrating process at times. Here are a few suggestions for managing your frustration:

1. Practice mindfulness: When you feel frustrated, take a moment to pause and focus on your breath. This can help you stay present and prevent you from getting overwhelmed by negative thoughts.
2. Reframe your thoughts: Instead of viewing your progress as too slow, try reframing it as progress, no matter how small. Acknowledge each step as a victory, even if it seems minor.
3. Set realistic goals: When setting goals for yourself, make sure they are achievable and realistic. Break larger goals into smaller, more manageable steps to help you stay motivated.
4. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and remember that everyone goes through challenging times. Treat yourself with the same compassion and understanding you would offer to a friend.
5. Celebrate small victories: Don't underestimate the importance of celebrating small victories. These moments can help boost your motivation and remind you of your progress.

By implementing these strategies, I hope you'll find it easier to manage your frustration and stay focused on your recovery. Let's set some realistic goals for our next session, and I'll be here to support you along the way.

Best regards,

AI CBT Therapist.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'll try those suggestions. Mindfulness, I get it. I'll focus on my breath when I feel frustrated. Reframing thoughts, that's something I need to work on. I tend to see things as all or nothing, so breaking it down into smaller steps might help.

Self-compassion, that's a tough one for me. I'm not used to being kind to myself. I'll try to remember that it's okay to cut myself some slack.

For the next session, let's set some goals. I want to try a small woodworking project, maybe something simple like fixing a chair. I'll also keep up with the body scanning and journaling.

Anything else you think I should focus on?

Therapist: Great progress, Derek! I'm glad to hear that you're taking my suggestions and trying new strategies. It's essential to practice self-compassion, so don't be too hard on yourself as you work on this skill.

Regarding your next session's goals, focusing on a small woodworking project is a fantastic idea. Here are some additional tips to help you prepare:

1. Start small: As you mentioned, choose a simple project to begin with. This will help you gradually build your confidence and reduce the risk of frustration.
2. Take breaks: Make sure to take frequent breaks when working on your project. This will help prevent fatigue and reduce the risk of injury.
3. Use proper techniques: Make sure to use proper woodworking techniques to ensure the project is done safely and effectively.
4. Ask for help: Don't be afraid to ask for help if you get stuck or need assistance. There are plenty of online resources and forums where you can find helpful tips and advice.

In addition to your woodworking goals, I encourage you to continue with your body scanning and journaling practices. Remember to celebrate small victories and remain patient with yourself as you progress through your recovery.

Looking forward to our next session, Derek. Best regards,

AI CBT Therapist.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'll keep those tips in mind for the woodworking project. I'll start small and take breaks, just like you said. I'll also keep up with the body scanning and journaling.

I'm still a bit skeptical about all this, but I'm trying. It's hard to change habits, especially when I've been doing things a certain way for so long. But I'll keep at it.

Anything else you think I should focus on for the next session?

Therapist: In that case, I'd like to address your skepticism and reassure you that it's completely normal to have doubts and concerns when trying new approaches. Here are a few suggestions for the next session to help you further engage with CBT techniques:

1. Reflect on past achievements: Think about times when you've successfully implemented change in your life, no matter how small. This can help build your confidence and show you that you're capable of making positive changes.
2. Set SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals can help you stay focused and motivated as you work on your recovery.
3. Track your progress: Keep a log or journal to record your thoughts, feelings, and achievements related to your CBT practices. This can help you identify patterns, areas for improvement, and celebrate small victories.
4. Collaborate with me: Feel free to reach out if you have questions, need support, or just want to discuss your progress. I'm here to help you navigate your recovery journey.
5. Practice positive self-talk: Catch yourself when you're thinking negatively, and replace those thoughts with positive, encouraging self-talk. For example, instead of saying, "I can't do this," try saying, "I'm capable and strong; I can handle this challenge."

By focusing on these areas, I believe you'll be able to deepen your engagement with CBT techniques and continue to make progress in your recovery.
