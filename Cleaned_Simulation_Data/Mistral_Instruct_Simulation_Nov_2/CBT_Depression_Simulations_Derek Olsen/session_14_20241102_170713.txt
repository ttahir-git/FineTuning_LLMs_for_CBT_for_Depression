Patient: Alright, let's get started. Here are the key points from our last session:

I encouraged you to explore healthier coping strategies for managing stress and pain, such as exercise, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.

6. **Homework Assignment**: I assigned you a task to write down three positive things about yourself each day and to try to engage in at least one of your hobbies, even if it feels difficult, to help combat negative self-talk and improve your overall mood.

Patient: Thanks for the summary. So, last time we talked about trying to cut back on the drinking and finding other ways to deal with the pain and stress. I've been trying to do that, but it's not easy. The pain's still there, and the stress doesn't go away just because I want it to.

I did manage to get out to the garage and look at my woodworking tools. It's been a while since I touched them, and it felt strange. I didn't actually start anything, though. Just looked at them and thought about how much I used to enjoy it.

The financial stuff is still a mess. I'm trying to keep up with the bills, but it's a struggle. I haven't reached out to my kids yet. It's hard to know what to say after all this time.

And the homework you gave me, writing down three positive things each day? I've been doing it, but some days it feels like I'm just making stuff up. I don't know if it's really helping.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you're making an effort to reduce your alcohol consumption and explore other coping strategies, even though it might be challenging. Remember, progress takes time, and small steps can lead to significant changes.

Reconnecting with your woodworking hobby is a fantastic idea. While it might feel strange at first, remember that it's about the process of rediscovering something you love. There's no rush to create a masterpiece right away. Just focusing on the task at hand and enjoying the process can bring a sense of accomplishment and well-being.

Managing your finances is indeed a challenge, and it's understandable that you're finding it hard. I encourage you to continue looking for resources and strategies to help you get through this difficult time. Seeking financial counseling could be a beneficial step to take.

Connecting with your children is an essential aspect of your recovery. It's understandable that it might feel difficult, but remember that starting the conversation can be a significant step towards repairing your relationship. Reach out to them, even if it's just a simple message, and let them know that you're thinking of them and would like to talk when they're ready.

Regarding your homework assignment, it's crucial to be honest with yourself when writing down positive things about yourself. If you're finding it challenging, try to focus on your strengths and accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem. Over time, you'll start to notice more positive aspects of yourself, and this exercise will become easier.

Lastly, I want to emphasize that it's okay to have setbacks, and it's normal to experience ups and downs during the recovery process. Remember to celebrate your small victories, and don't give up on the strategies that you've found helpful. Together, we can work on finding ways to help you manage your chronic pain, stress, and emotions more effectively.

Would you like to discuss any other concerns or thoughts you've had since our last session, or shall we focus on setting some goals for this session?

Patient: I appreciate the encouragement, but I'm still not sure about this whole financial counseling thing. I mean, I get that it might help, but it feels like just another thing to add to the list of things I can't keep up with.

And with the kids, I don't know. I sent a text to Emma, just a simple "Hey, how's it going?" but she hasn't replied. It's been a week now. I don't know if I should try again or just leave it be. It's frustrating because I want to fix things, but it feels like I'm just making it worse.

As for the woodworking, I might try to start something small this weekend. Maybe just a simple shelf or something. It's been so long, though, I'm not even sure if I remember how to do it.

And the positive things homework, I'm still doing it, but like I said, some days it feels forced. I don't know if it's really making a difference. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this kind of stuff.

Therapist: I understand your concerns about financial counseling and the situation with your children. It's understandable to feel hesitant about adding more to your plate during challenging times.

Regarding financial counseling, it can be beneficial to have a professional help you create a manageable budget, find ways to increase your income, and explore options for reducing your debts. However, it's essential to find a counselor or service that fits your needs and circumstances, so it might take some research to find the right one. I encourage you to take your time and find a suitable option before making a commitment.

As for your relationship with your children, it's essential to be patient and persistent. Reaching out once is a positive step, but it may take time for them to respond. If Emma hasn't replied, consider sending another message expressing your concerns and asking if it's okay to discuss things further when she has time. Remember that mending relationships takes time and effort, and it's important not to give up.

Regarding woodworking, starting small and working your way up is a great approach. It might take some time to regain your confidence, but the key is to focus on the process and enjoy the journey. Don't compare yourself to how you were before, as the situation is different now, and it's important to acknowledge that.

The positive thinking homework is a valuable exercise, and it may take time to see noticeable improvements. Try focusing on the benefits of this exercise, such as the potential for increased self-esteem and overall well-being. If you're struggling with finding positive things to write each day, consider talking to me about alternative exercises that may be more suitable for you.

It's essential to acknowledge that progress takes time and that it's normal to have setbacks. Let's focus on this session's goals. What would you like to focus on today, Derek? Are there any specific challenges you'd like to work on, or is there something we haven't discussed yet that you'd like to explore further?

Patient: I think I'd like to focus on the woodworking and maybe some of the financial stuff. The woodworking, I know it's just a hobby, but it feels like something I used to be good at, something that made me feel like I had a purpose. And the financial stuff, well, it's just always there, hanging over my head. I don't know if there's really a way out of it, but maybe if we can figure out a plan, it might help ease some of the stress.

As for the kids, I'll keep trying with Emma. I sent her another message, just a simple one, asking if she's free to talk sometime. I don't want to push too hard, but I also don't want to give up.

And the positive thinking homework, I'll keep doing it, but maybe we can talk about some other ways to help with that too. It's just hard to see the good in things when everything feels so heavy.
