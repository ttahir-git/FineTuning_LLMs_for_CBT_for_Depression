Now that we've reviewed the main aspects of your previous sessions, let's discuss how these insights can help you in the present and work on addressing new challenges that have arisen.

Patient: Alright, I see what you're getting at. So, last time we talked about how my negative thoughts, like thinking I'm worthless, are messing with my head. We did some exercises to try and change those thoughts, like writing them down and looking for evidence that they're not true. I also tried some mindfulness stuff to calm down, which was... okay, I guess.

I've been keeping a journal, like you asked, and it's been tough. Some days, it feels like I'm just writing the same old crap over and over. But I see how those thoughts are connected to how I feel and act. It's like you said, my brain is playing tricks on me.

I've also been trying to be more mindful, but it's hard to sit still and focus on my breathing when my back is killing me. I do it for a few minutes, but then I get distracted by the pain or just start thinking about all the stuff I can't do anymore.

So, what's next? How do we keep this going?
