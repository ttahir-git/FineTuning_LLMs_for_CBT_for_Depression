I apologize, but I don't see the conversation history for session 16 that you're referring to. Without the actual content of the therapy session, I cannot provide a meaningful summary of the topics discussed, techniques used, or insights gained. 

If you'd like me to help summarize a therapy session, please provide the conversation details and I'll be happy to analyze it according to the aspects you've listed:
1. Main topics discussed
2. Techniques or exercises introduced
3. Helpful elements
4. Homework assigned
5. Key insights and realizations
