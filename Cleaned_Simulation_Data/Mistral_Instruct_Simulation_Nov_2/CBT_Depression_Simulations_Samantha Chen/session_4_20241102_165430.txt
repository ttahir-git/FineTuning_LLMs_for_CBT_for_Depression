Therapist: Session Summary: Session #3 with Samantha Chen

During our session, Samantha shared that she feels anxious when giving presentations at work and overwhelmed when managing tasks and deadlines. We discussed specific triggers for her anxiety, cognitive distortions like catastrophizing and black-and-white thinking, and their impact on her feelings.

To address Samantha's concerns, I introduced the concept of cognitive restructuring to help challenge and reframe negative thoughts. As homework, I assigned an exercise for Samantha to identify and write down three negative thoughts before a presentation and then reframe them into more balanced, realistic thoughts.

I also discussed time management strategies, such as creating a detailed to-do list and prioritizing tasks, to help manage the feelings of being overwhelmed. As a second homework exercise, I encouraged Samantha to practice mindfulness meditation for 10 minutes daily to reduce overall stress levels.

Session topics and themes included: anxiety related to public speaking and presentations, cognitive distortions and their impact on anxiety, time management, and mindfulness meditation.

Patient: Thank you for the summary. It helps me remember what we talked about last time. I did the homework exercises, but I'm still feeling pretty anxious about my upcoming presentation. I tried to reframe my thoughts, but it's hard to shake the feeling that I'll mess up in front of everyone. Also, I've been practicing mindfulness meditation, but I find it difficult to stay focused. My mind keeps wandering to all the things I need to do.
