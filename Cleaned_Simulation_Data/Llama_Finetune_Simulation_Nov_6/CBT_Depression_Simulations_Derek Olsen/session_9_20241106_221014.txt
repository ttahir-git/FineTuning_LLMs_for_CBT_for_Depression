I hear that you're feeling a mix of hope and uncertainty, Derek. It's completely normal to feel this way. Change takes time, and it's okay to have doubts while still being willing to try new approaches.

Since we're nearing the end of our session, let me summarize what we've covered today:

1. We discussed your challenges with finding a massage therapist and identified how "fortune telling" thoughts might be affecting your experience.
2. We explored how considering alternative perspectives could help reduce anxiety and increase motivation.
3. We agreed on a homework task: keeping a thought record to track negative predictions and practice considering alternative perspectives.

For next week, I'd like you to:
1. Complete the thought record exercise
2. Continue with your stretching routine
3. Try taking those short walks, starting with whatever distance feels manageable

Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end today's session?

Therapist: I'd like to hear more about the challenges you faced with the homework from last week's session. It can help me understand where we might need to adjust our approach.

Patient: Alright, so last week's homework was to keep a thought record and try some short walks. The thought record part, I didn't really get. I mean, I wrote down some stuff, but it felt kind of pointless. Like, I wrote down that I thought I'd never find a good massage therapist, and then I was supposed to write down something different? It just didn't click for me.

As for the walks, I managed to get out a couple of times. Nothing big, just around the block. It helped a bit, but the pain's still there, you know? It's hard to stay motivated when it feels like nothing's really changing.

Therapist: I understand. It's common for people to struggle with the idea of reframing negative thoughts at first. It takes practice to start seeing things from a different perspective. I'm glad you were able to get out for a few walks, even if the pain didn't change as much as you'd hoped. Every small step counts.

Patient: Yeah, I guess. It's just frustrating, though. I mean, I used to be able to do so much more, and now even a short walk feels like a big deal. I don't know, maybe I'm just too old to change.

Therapist: That's not true, Derek. You're not too old. Aging is one thing, but your current situation isn't permanent. You're facing real challenges right now, but that doesn't mean you can't improve. I believe you have the ability to make positive changes, even if they're slow and small at first.

Patient: I appreciate that, but it's hard to see it sometimes. I just feel like I'm stuck in this rut, and nothing's really helping. I mean, I tried the thought record, but it didn't feel like it was doing much. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this kind of thing.

Therapist: I'm glad you're sharing this, Derek. It's important that we work together to find what helps you. If the thought record isn't working for you, we can explore other options. But I want to emphasize that you're not giving up, even if you're having doubts right now. You're taking steps to make changes, and that's something to be proud of.

Patient: Alright, I'll give it another shot. Maybe I just need to figure out a way to make it more... I don't know, practical for me. But thanks for not giving up on me, even when I feel like giving up on myself.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm here to support you, no matter what. And I have an idea for your homework this week that might help with the thought record. We could try doing it together, like a joint exercise. That way, I can help you break down those negative thoughts and see how they're affecting you. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like it might help. I'm willing to give it a try. Maybe having someone walk me through it will make it easier to understand.

Therapist: Exactly. We'll work through it step by step, and I'll explain how the process can help you start shifting your perspective. It's not about trying to ignore your pain or being unrealistic, but rather about finding ways to cope with it and still live the life you want to live.

Patient: Alright, I'm in. Let's do this together. Maybe it'll make more sense this way.

Therapist: Absolutely. And remember, just because it's challenging doesn't mean it's not worth doing. You've already taken so many brave steps, Derek. I'm proud of you for that. Now let's take this next one together.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate that. Let's get to it.

Therapist: Let's start by reviewing what we discussed last week. You mentioned that the thought record exercise didn't feel practical for you. Can you tell me more about what made it feel that way?

Patient: Well, it just seemed too... I don't know, abstract? Like, writing down my thoughts and then trying to change them felt forced. I couldn't really see how it was going to help me in real life.

Therapist: That's a great observation, Derek. Sometimes when we're first learning these skills, they can feel a bit abstract. But I want to assure you that there is a clear connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. And by working on changing those negative thoughts, we can help you start to change the other two as well.

For example, let's say you have the thought, "I'll never find a good massage therapist." How does that thought make you feel?

Patient: It makes me feel frustrated and hopeless. Like, why even bother trying to find one if I'm just going to be disappointed again?

Therapist: And when you're feeling that way, what do you do?

Patient: I usually just give up and stay home. Maybe have a few drinks to numb the frustration.

Therapist: So that thought of "I'll never find a good massage therapist" leads to feelings of frustration and hopelessness, which in turn lead to behaviors like staying home and self-medicating. And those behaviors then reinforce the original thought, creating a kind of vicious cycle.

Now, let's say you could change that thought to something like, "I might not find the perfect therapist right away, but I can still take steps to find someone who could help me." How would that change how you feel and what you do?

Patient: Hmm, maybe I'd feel a bit more hopeful and less defeated. I might actually go out and look for a therapist instead of just giving up.

Therapist: Exactly! So you can see how changing your thoughts can have a big impact on your feelings and actions. And that's what we're working on with the thought record - helping you practice recognizing those negative thoughts and replacing them with more balanced, helpful ones.

And remember, we're not trying to make you ignore your real challenges. We're just looking for ways to help you cope with them differently, so you can start to feel more in control of your life again.

Patient: Alright, I get that. So, what do I need to do next?

Therapist: Let's start with a simple example. Can you think of a situation from the past week where you noticed yourself feeling down or anxious?

Patient: Yeah, there was this one day last week when I was trying to organize my tools in the garage. It was supposed to be something small, something manageable, but I just couldn't get anything done. Every time I tried to move something, my back would flare up, and then I'd start thinking about how useless I am now, how I can't even put my own tools away without pain. That just made me feel even worse, like I'm just a burden now. After that, I just gave up and went back inside, poured myself a drink, and watched TV the rest of the day.

Therapist: That's a great example, Derek. Let's break this down step by step. First, what was the situation that triggered these thoughts and feelings?

Patient: The situation was trying to organize my tools in the garage. I thought it would be a simple task, but my back pain made it impossible.

Therapist: Okay, so the situation was a task that you hoped to be manageable, but your back pain created challenges. And what automatic thoughts did you notice in that moment?

Patient: The thoughts were things like, "I'm useless now," "I can't do anything without pain," and "I'm just a burden."

Therapist: Those thoughts are very distressing and critical. They reflect a sense of hopelessness and helplessness. And how did those thoughts make you feel?

Patient: They made me feel defeated, like there's no point in even trying. It made me feel like I'm just a failure now.

Therapist: And how did those feelings lead to your behaviors in that situation?

Patient: Well, after feeling that way, I just gave up on the task. I went back inside, had a drink, and watched TV the rest of the day. It was like I was trying to numb myself from those feelings.

Therapist: That's a great insight. You can see how the situation, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors all connect. Now, let's look at those thoughts again. Specifically, that first one: "I'm useless now." What would you say is the evidence that supports that thought?

Patient: The evidence is that I can't do the things I used to do, like work or even organize my own tools. My back pain makes everything harder, and I feel like I'm not contributing anything anymore.

Therapist: That's understandable. Now, let's look at the other side. What would you say is the evidence against that thought?

Patient: Well, I guess I still manage to do some things, like cooking for myself and taking care of basic chores. And I still have some skills, even if I can't use them the way I used to.
