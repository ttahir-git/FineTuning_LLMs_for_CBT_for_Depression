Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again for our 16th session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI before we begin. I don't have real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hey, Nova. Yeah, I've been... alright, I guess. Still dealing with the same old stuff. The sleep's been rough, like usual. Tried that stimulus control thing you mentioned, but it's hard to stick to it when you're in pain all the time. 

And the gratitude journaling? I don't know, it feels kinda forced. Like, I get the idea, but it's hard to find things to be grateful for when you're in this much pain and feeling so useless. But I did go for that walk on Wednesday, like you asked. It was tough, but I managed.

Therapist: I appreciate your honesty, Derek. It's not uncommon to have mixed feelings about these exercises. The fact that you were able to go for a walk despite the pain and difficulty is a significant accomplishment. It shows that even in small ways, you're taking steps towards engaging with your life. I hear that practicing gratitude and stimulus control can feel forced at first, and it's okay if they don't feel natural right away. What matters is that you're trying, and over time, these practices can become more automatic and meaningful.

Before we dive in, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. We can discuss your experience with the homework, explore how your pain and feelings of worthlessness might be influencing your thoughts and behaviors, and perhaps identify some strategies to help you engage with your life a bit more. How does that sound?

Patient: Yeah, that sounds alright. I mean, I'm here, so might as well talk about it. I guess we can start with the homework. Like I said, the walk was tough, but I did it. And the gratitude journaling, well, I tried it, but it didn't really click for me. I wrote down a few things, but it felt kinda hollow. 

As for the pain and feeling worthless, it's always there. I wake up with it, go to bed with it. It's like a constant reminder that I'm not the man I used to be. I used to be able to build things, fix things. Now, I can't even do basic stuff around the house without help. It's frustrating, to say the least.

Therapist: Derek, I can understand how frustrating and overwhelming it must feel to have these persistent physical limitations and the thoughts and feelings that come with them. It's a loss, an adjustment to your identity as a man and a father. The fact that you're still showing up here, though, despite all of this, is a testament to your strength and resilience.

When we talk about finding things to be grateful for, it's not about ignoring or dismissing the pain and limitations. It's about recognizing the small moments of beauty, joy, or connection that do exist, even amidst the difficult reality. When we get stuck in the cycle of self-blame and frustration, it can be hard to see these things.

You mentioned feeling hollow when you tried gratitude journaling. That's a common experience, especially at first. It takes practice to train our minds to look for the good, even when it feels unnatural. What might be a small moment from your week that you could acknowledge as a thing to be grateful for?

Patient: I get what you're saying, Nova. It's just... hard to see the good when you're in so much pain and feeling so useless. But, I guess, if I have to think about it, there was this one moment last week. My grandson, he came over, and we just sat and watched a game together. He's only five, so he doesn't really understand what I'm going through, but it was nice to just be there with him, you know? No pressure, no expectations. Just us, watching the game. 

It was small, but it was something. Maybe that's what you mean by finding the good, even when it feels small.

Therapist: That moment with your grandson is a beautiful example of how even in the midst of pain and loss, there can be moments of connection and joy. It's a sign that even as your physical abilities change, your relationship with your family can continue to have meaning. 

When we practice gratitude, we're not looking for anything grand or significant. Even a moment like the one you shared with your grandson is something to be acknowledged. It's about training our minds to see the good, even when it's hard to do so. 

I hear that journaling felt hollow, but as you continue to practice, it might start to feel more natural. It's also okay if some days it's easier to find things to be grateful for than others. The goal is progress, not perfection.

Speaking of progress, you mentioned that you had a few other things you'd like to discuss today. What else has been on your mind?

Patient: Yeah, there's a few things. Like I said, the pain's always there, and it's not just physical. It's like, I wake up every day and the first thing I think is, "What's the point?" I used to get up, go to work, build things, be someone. Now, I can't even do the simplest stuff without help. It's like I'm just a burden. 

And then there's the money. I'm barely scraping by on disability, and I'm behind on child support. My kids, they don't say it, but I know they're disappointed in me. I used to be the one they could count on, and now... I don't know. It's like I'm just letting everyone down.

Therapist: Derek, what you're describing is a deep sense of loss and identity crisis. The roles you once played – the provider, the problem-solver – have shifted, and it's natural to feel a sense of disconnection from who you once were. 

It's important to remember that even as your physical abilities change, your worth and value do not. Being a grandfather, a father, and a man is not about what you can do physically. It's about who you are in your heart and your relationships.

When you think that you're a burden, that you're letting everyone down, are you aware of how you're talking to yourself? Are there any specific thoughts that come up around these feelings?

Patient: Yeah, I guess I do talk to myself like that. It's like, "You're useless, Derek. You can't do anything right. You're just a burden." It's constant, like a broken record in my head. And it's not just about the physical stuff. It's like, I used to be able to fix things, provide for my family, be someone they could rely on. Now, I can't even pay my bills on time. It's like I'm failing at everything. 

And the worst part is, I know my kids don't say it, but I can see it in their eyes. They're disappointed. They don't need me like they used to, and I don't know how to be there for them anymore. It's like I'm just... fading away.

Therapist: Derek, what you're experiencing is a deep sense of loss and disconnection. It's common for people who have been the primary providers to feel a sense of failure when they can no longer fulfill that role. However, it's crucial to recognize that your worth is not defined by your abilities to pay bills or fix things.

Your children may be struggling with their own emotions and fears about your well-being. However, it's possible they still care about you and value your presence in their lives. Have you had a recent conversation with your children about their feelings?

Patient: I haven't really talked to them about it. I mean, I know they care, but I also know they're dealing with their own stuff. Emma's got her own family to worry about, and Jake, well, he's got his own struggles. I don't want to burden them with my problems. 

But you're right, maybe I should try talking to them. Maybe they don't see it the same way I do. Maybe they still need me in some way, even if it's not the way I used to be there for them.

Therapist: It's understandable that you don't want to burden them with your problems. However, communicating with your children about your feelings and needs can help bridge the gap and foster a stronger bond. It's possible that they have been waiting for you to open up, and they may appreciate knowing how you're feeling.

As you consider talking to your children, what thoughts or fears come up for you? Are you concerned about their reaction or the way it might affect your relationship?

Patient: Yeah, I guess I'm worried about their reaction. I don't want them to feel like they have to take care of me. I've always been the one taking care of things, and now it feels like I'm just a burden. 

And then there's the fear that they'll just confirm what I already think—that I'm not needed anymore. That they've moved on and I'm just... in the way. It's hard to face that, you know? It's like admitting that I'm not the man I used to be, and that's a tough pill to swallow.

Therapist: Derek, it takes courage to face these fears and open up about your struggles. It's understandable to worry about your children's reaction and the potential impact on your relationship. However, it's also possible that by communicating your needs and feelings, you may find new ways to connect with them.

As we've discussed before, our thoughts can have a significant impact on our feelings and behaviors. When you think about talking to your children, what specific thoughts come up? Can we explore those thoughts together?

Patient: Yeah, I guess the main thought is that they'll see me as weak. I've always been the strong one, the one who could handle anything. Now, I feel like I'm falling apart, and I don't want them to see that. 

Another thought is that they'll just brush it off, like it's not a big deal. They've got their own lives, and I don't want to be another problem for them to deal with. It's like, I'm already a disappointment, and I don't want to add to that.

And then there's the fear that they'll just confirm what I already think—that I'm not needed anymore. That they've moved on and I'm just... in the way. It's hard to face that, you know? It's like admitting that I'm not the man I used to be, and that's a tough pill to swallow.

Therapist: Derek, these thoughts are understandable given your past roles and the challenges you've faced recently. Let's explore them further.

When you think that your children will see you as weak, how does that make you feel? What do you think might happen if they did see you as weak?

Patient: It makes me feel ashamed, like I'm letting them down. I don't want them to think I can't handle things on my own anymore. If they see me as weak, I worry they'll start treating me differently, like I'm some kind of charity case. 

And then there's the fear that they'll just confirm what I already think—that I'm not needed anymore. That they've moved on and I'm just... in the way. It's hard to face that, you know? It's like admitting that I'm not the man I used to be, and that's a tough pill to swallow.

Therapist: I understand why those thoughts and fears can be so distressing for you. However, we can work on reframing these thoughts to be more balanced and compassionate. When you think that your children will see you as weak, is there any evidence that contradicts this belief? Have there been times when your children have shown understanding or support?

Patient: Well, there was that one time Emma came over with groceries and didn't say anything about the bills. She just asked how I was doing and stayed for a while. I guess that was her way of showing she cares, even if she didn't say it outright. 

And Jake, he called me out of the blue a few months ago, just to check in. He didn't ask for anything, just wanted to know how I was holding up. I didn't really give him much, but he didn't push. I guess that's something.

But still, it's hard to shake the feeling that they're just being nice because they feel obligated, not because they really need me.

Therapist: Derek, it's significant that you're able to identify examples of your children's understanding and support. These experiences suggest that they do care about you, even if it's not always expressed in words. As we've discussed before, our thoughts often distort our perception of reality, leading us to believe things that aren't entirely accurate.

One technique we can use to challenge these distorted thoughts is cognitive restructuring. This involves examining the evidence for and against a particular thought, considering alternative perspectives, and developing a more balanced and realistic view.

Let's try this with the thought "My children will see me as weak." What evidence do you have that supports this thought? What evidence do you have that contradicts it?

Patient: Well, the evidence that supports it is mostly my own feelings and fears. I feel like I'm not the man I used to be, and I'm scared they'll see that too. I'm worried they'll think I'm just a burden now.

But the evidence that contradicts it... like I said, Emma bringing groceries and just checking in, and Jake calling to see how I'm doing. Those are small things, but they show that they still care, even if they don't say it outright.

I guess I just need to remind myself that they're not just being nice out of obligation. They do care, even if it's not in the way I'm used to.

Therapist: Exactly, Derek. You've identified important pieces of evidence that contradict your initial thought. By considering this evidence, you can develop a more balanced perspective that acknowledges your children's genuine care and support.

As we continue to work together, we can practice reframing thoughts like these to promote more compassionate and realistic ways of thinking. Remember, our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. By challenging distorted thoughts, we can begin to shift our emotions and actions in a more positive direction.

What do you think about setting a goal related to communicating with your children? We could focus on having a conversation with each of them to express your feelings and needs. How do you feel about this idea?

Patient: I guess it's worth a shot. I mean, I've been avoiding it for so long, and it hasn't really helped anything. Maybe if I just talk to them, it'll make things a little clearer. 

But I'm still worried about how they'll react. I don't want to push them away or make them feel like they have to take care of me. It's a tough balance to strike.

Therapist: I understand that it can be challenging to find the right words and the right balance. Remember that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to share them with your children. As we discussed earlier, it's possible that your children have been waiting for you to open up, and they may appreciate knowing how you're feeling.

Let's break down the steps for having this conversation. First, you can choose a quiet, private time to talk with each of your children individually. You may want to plan what you want to say in advance, but be prepared for the conversation to go in different directions.

Remember, the goal isn't necessarily to convince your children that everything is okay, but rather to share your feelings and let them know that you're working through some challenges. Acknowledge their own feelings and experiences, and show them that you care about them.

After the conversation, take some time to process your own feelings. You may feel relieved, anxious, or a mix of emotions. It's normal to have mixed reactions, and we can discuss these in our sessions.

What do you think about this plan? Is there anything you'd like to add or modify?

Patient: I think the plan sounds okay. I'll try to find a good time to talk to each of them. Maybe over the weekend when things are a bit quieter. 

I guess I'll just be honest about how I'm feeling, without expecting too much from them. If they react well, great. If not, at least I tried. 

I'll let you know how it goes next session. Hopefully, it'll be a step in the right direction.

Therapist: That sounds like a solid plan, Derek. Remember that you can always reach out for support if you need it. It's okay if the conversations don't go perfectly, but the fact that you're making an effort is significant in itself.
