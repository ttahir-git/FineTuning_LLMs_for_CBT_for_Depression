Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again for our 7th session. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous meeting. It's essential for us to build upon our progress and address any challenges you may have faced since our last session. Before we dive into today's agenda, I want to acknowledge some limitations as your AI therapist. While I strive to provide evidence-based guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me during our sessions. Additionally, as an AI, there's a possibility I might generate inaccurate information or lack the ability to interpret non-verbal cues. If you ever find the information provided unhelpful, please feel free to correct me, and we can work together to find a solution. Lastly, if you ever experience thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please reach out to a local emergency service or a trusted friend or family member immediately, as I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations. With that said, let's explore how you've been doing since our last session. How has your mood been, and have you noticed any changes in your thoughts or behaviors?

Patient: Hey, Nova. Yeah, it's been a rough week. My mood's been pretty low, to be honest. I tried sending that text to Emma and Jake, but I chickened out at the last minute. I just couldn't find the right words, you know? 

As for the stretching exercises, I've been doing them, but I don't feel much difference. Maybe I'm not doing them right. And I haven't been able to find a massage therapist yet. The whole process feels overwhelming. 

I did try taking a few short walks around the block, but it's hard with this back pain. I guess I'm just feeling stuck and frustrated.

Therapist: Derek, I appreciate your honesty about your struggles this past week. It takes courage to share these challenges, and I'm here to support you through them. Let's take a closer look at each of the areas you mentioned. Regarding the text to your children, it's understandable to feel nervous about reaching out. We can work together to find the right words, or even consider starting with a simple message expressing a desire to connect. Remember, small steps can lead to meaningful progress. 

As for the stretching exercises, it's possible that finding the right technique or position might make a difference. We can explore that together during our session today. Pain management is a multi-faceted approach, and it's okay to try different techniques until you find what works best for you.

Regarding the massage therapist, I hear that the process feels overwhelming. Let's break it down into smaller, manageable steps, and celebrate the progress you've already made. Remember, finding the right therapist is a process, and it's okay to take your time.

I also hear that taking short walks was challenging due to your back pain. Let's discuss some strategies to make walking more manageable, such as using a walker or starting with shorter distances and gradually increasing. 

I'm here to support you, Derek. Let's work through these challenges together, one step at a time. What do you think about focusing on these areas during our session today?

Patient: Yeah, I guess breaking things down might help. I'm still not sure about the text to Emma and Jake. It feels like a big deal, and I don't want to mess it up. 

As for the stretching, I'm open to trying different positions or techniques. Maybe you can show me some examples or give me more detailed instructions? 

Finding a massage therapist is definitely overwhelming. I don't even know where to start. Maybe if you could give me some specific steps or resources to look into, that would help. 

And the walking, yeah, it's tough. I don't have a walker, but maybe I could try shorter distances and see how it goes. 

So, let's focus on those things. I'm willing to give it a shot, but I need some clear guidance.

Therapist: Derek, I'm glad we're focusing on these areas today. Before we dive in, I want to check in with how you're feeling about the therapy process in general. It's normal to have ups and downs, but I'm curious about your overall experience. Do you feel that our sessions have been helpful so far? Have there been any aspects where you felt like you weren't making progress or understood the material fully?

Patient: I guess the sessions have been somewhat helpful. It's hard to say for sure. Sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions, and other times, like when we talk about practical stuff like stretching or finding a massage therapist, it feels more useful. 

But there are times when I don't really get what you're saying, like with those cognitive distortions. It's all a bit abstract for me. I need more concrete examples or something to really grasp it. 

Overall, I'm still skeptical, but I'm here, so that's something, right?

Therapist: Derek, I appreciate your honesty about the therapy process. It's common to have mixed feelings about the sessions, and it's okay to have doubts. Let's explore the parts where you felt like you didn't understand or grasp the material fully. We can review the cognitive distortions and find examples that resonate with you personally. 

I want to emphasize that skepticism is a normal part of the journey, and it doesn't mean therapy isn't working. In fact, being able to question and evaluate what we discuss is an important part of the process. Your doubts and concerns give us opportunities to clarify and refine our approach.

Let's start with the cognitive distortions. Can you share an example of a thought or situation where you felt confused about the concept or needed a more concrete example?

Patient: Yeah, I guess the whole "fortune telling" thing is what I'm struggling with the most. I don't really get how it applies to me. Like, I know I worry a lot about the future, but I don't see how that's different from just being realistic. 

Can you give me an example of "fortune telling" in a way that makes sense to me? Something more down-to-earth, not just abstract ideas.

Therapist: You're right, Derek, it's important to understand how cognitive distortions like "fortune telling" apply to your specific experiences. Let's take an example from your life to illustrate this concept. 

Recently, you mentioned that you've been struggling to find a massage therapist who you feel comfortable with and trust. You also said that the entire process feels overwhelming. Could you tell me more about the thoughts you've been having around this situation?

Patient: You're right, it's been hard finding the right massage therapist. I've been going to this one place for a few weeks now, but the therapists keep changing. I never know who I'll get, and I feel like I'm starting over every time. I keep thinking, "What if this new person doesn't know what they're doing? What if they make my back worse?" It just feels like I'm wasting my time and money.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Derek. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety and uncertainty around finding the right therapist for you. Let's break this down using the "fortune telling" concept.

It seems like you're predicting that every new therapist will disappoint you and that the process will be fruitless. This is a common "fortune telling" pattern where you assume the worst possible outcome without considering other possibilities.

For example, what if the new therapist is experienced and skilled? What if they're able to provide relief from your pain and help you feel more relaxed? How might that impact your experience of the situation?

Patient: I guess I never really thought about it that way. I just assume the worst because it's what I'm used to. But yeah, maybe the new therapist could be good. It's just hard to believe that when I've had so many bad experiences. 

But I see what you're saying. I'm always expecting the worst, and that doesn't help anything. Maybe I should try to be more open to the possibility that things could go well.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Derek. Recognizing the impact of these negative predictions is the first step in changing this pattern. As we've discussed before, our thoughts have a powerful influence on our feelings and behaviors.

When you're able to consider the possibility that a new therapist might be helpful, how do you think that might affect your feelings about the situation?

Patient: I think if I could believe that a new therapist might actually help, I'd feel less anxious about going. It might even make me more open to trying different therapists until I find the right one. Right now, I just feel like it's a waste of time and money, so I don't even want to bother.

Therapist: That's a great point, Derek. By challenging those negative predictions and considering other possibilities, you may start to feel less stuck and more motivated to keep trying new therapists. This could lead to more positive experiences and eventually, finding the right therapist for you.

I want to emphasize that changing these patterns takes practice and patience. It's not about replacing negative thoughts with positive ones, but rather considering alternative perspectives and letting go of the need to control the outcome.

What do you think about setting a homework task related to this concept of "fortune telling"? For example, you could keep a thought record of any negative predictions you have throughout the week, and try to challenge them by considering other possibilities. What do you think about that?

Patient: I get what you're saying about considering other possibilities, but I'm not sure I can just flip a switch and change the way I think. I've been dealing with this pain and the stress of trying to find a decent therapist for months now. It's not like I haven't thought about the other side of things, but it's hard to shake the feeling that this is just how it's going to be.

Setting a homework task sounds like a lot of work. I'm already struggling to keep up with everything else. But I guess if it could help, I could give it a shot. What would this thought record involve, exactly?

Therapist: Derek, I completely understand that changing long-standing thought patterns is a difficult and gradual process. It's not about "flipping a switch" overnight, but rather about gradually developing new ways of thinking and relating to your experiences.

The thought record homework task involves simply writing down any negative predictions or "fortune telling" thoughts that come up for you during the week. These could be about the massage therapist situation or any other area of your life where you notice these patterns.

For each thought, you would write down the situation, the specific negative prediction, and then consider an alternative perspective. This might involve asking yourself questions like, "What evidence do I have that supports this prediction?" or "Is there another way I could look at this situation?"

By doing this, you're training your brain to notice these thought patterns and consider other possibilities. It's not about dismissing the negative thoughts completely, but rather learning to view them differently and not let them control your emotions and behaviors.

It's a process of gradually shifting your perspective, and that takes practice and patience. I know you've been dealing with a lot of pain and stress lately, and I commend you for the progress you've made so far. 

What do you think about giving this a try this week? We can review your thought record together during our next session and discuss what you found challenging or helpful.

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a try. I can see how writing things down might help me think about them differently. I'll jot down any negative thoughts I have about the massage therapist and see if I can come up with some other ways to look at it.

But I gotta be honest, this is gonna be tough. I'm not used to thinking about things in this way. I'll do my best, though.

Therapist: Derek, I appreciate your willingness to give this homework task a try. It's normal to find it challenging at first, especially if you're not used to thinking about things in this way. It takes practice and patience to develop new ways of thinking.

I want to emphasize that the goal is not to be perfect or dismiss the negative thoughts completely, but rather to gradually notice and consider alternative perspectives. It's a process of learning to relate to your thoughts differently and not let them control your emotions and behaviors.

As you work on this homework task, remember that we can discuss your experiences together in our sessions. I'm here to support you and provide guidance along the way.

Before we wrap up today, let's check in on how you're feeling now. Has anything shifted for you in our discussion today? How are you feeling about the therapy process in general?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful, I guess. It's still hard to believe that changing the way I think could make a real difference, but I'm willing to try. I just hope it doesn't take too long to see some results.

As for the therapy process, it's still a struggle for me. I don't like talking about my feelings, and it feels like I'm just going in circles sometimes. But I know I need to keep at it if I want to get better.
