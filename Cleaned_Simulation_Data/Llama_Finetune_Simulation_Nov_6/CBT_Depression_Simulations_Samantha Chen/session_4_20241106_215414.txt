Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again for our fourth session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI before we begin. While I can provide guidance and support, I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice those self-compassion affirmations every morning. It's been a bit hit or miss, but I did manage to use one of the coping cards when I felt overwhelmed by a design decision. I set a two-hour time limit, which helped me focus better. However, I still find myself up late at night, reworking things and feeling anxious about the business. My partner Michael has noticed a slight improvement in my mood, but we're still not quite back to where we were before all this started.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you've been actively working on the techniques we discussed, even if it hasn't been perfect. Setting time limits for design tasks is a significant step towards managing perfectionism. I understand that your late nights and anxiety about the business are still present, but the fact that Michael has noticed a slight improvement shows that progress is being made. Today, we'll focus on building upon the successes you've had and exploring ways to address the ongoing challenges. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds good. I'm open to exploring more ways to manage my anxiety and perfectionism. It's just hard to see the progress sometimes when I'm so deep in it.

Therapist: That's a valid concern, and it's completely normal to feel that way. Progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs along the way. Today, we'll work on developing additional coping strategies for managing anxiety and stress related to your business. We'll also discuss ways to communicate with Michael about your challenges and support needs. To start, let's set an agenda for our session. What would you like to prioritize today?

Patient: I think prioritizing ways to manage my anxiety and stress would be really helpful. Also, I'd like to talk more about how to communicate better with Michael. It's been tough, and I know he's trying to be supportive, but I feel like I'm not giving him enough of myself right now.

Therapist: I understand that you want to focus on managing your anxiety and stress, as well as improving communication with Michael. Let's start by exploring your anxiety related to your business. Can you share a recent situation where you felt particularly anxious or overwhelmed?

Patient: Sure. Just yesterday, I had a meeting with a potential investor. I spent hours preparing, but when I got there, I felt like I wasn't making a good impression. I kept second-guessing everything I said and worried that I didn't convey my passion for the business clearly enough. After the meeting, I felt drained and anxious, and I ended up reworking my pitch for hours into the night.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that experience, Samantha. It sounds like the anticipation leading up to the meeting and the pressure to perform caused you a great deal of anxiety. Let's examine this situation using a thought record. Can you identify the emotions you felt during and after the meeting, as well as their intensity on a scale of 0-100?

Patient: During the meeting, I felt anxious (85), nervous (75), and self-conscious (70). After the meeting, I felt anxious (90), disappointed (80), and drained (75).

Therapist: Now, let's identify the automatic thoughts that were going through your mind during this situation. What thoughts contributed to those emotions?

Patient: I was thinking things like, "I'm not good enough," "They probably think I'm inexperienced," and "I'm going to fail and lose everything."

Therapist: Those are some harsh and self-critical thoughts, Samantha. Let's examine the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you're not good enough or that the investor thinks you're inexperienced?

Patient: Well, I don't have any direct evidence that the investor thinks I'm inexperienced. They didn't say anything negative, but I just felt like they weren't impressed. As for not being good enough, I keep comparing myself to other entrepreneurs who seem to have it all figured out, and I feel like I'm falling short.

Therapist: It's common to compare ourselves to others, but we often don't see the full picture. Now, let's look at the evidence against those thoughts. What are some strengths or successes that counteract these self-critical thoughts?

Patient: I've managed to launch GreenThread and get it off the ground, which is no small feat. I've also received positive feedback from customers and some industry professionals. Plus, Michael has always believed in me and my abilities.

Therapist: That's great evidence against the thought that you're not good enough. You've demonstrated your capabilities and made significant progress with your business. Now, let's come up with an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence for and against your initial thoughts. What might be a more balanced way of thinking about this situation?

Patient: Maybe a more balanced thought would be, "I've made significant progress with GreenThread, and while I may not have impressed this investor, I have the potential to succeed and grow my business."

Therapist: That's a much more balanced and realistic thought, Samantha. How do you feel when you consider this alternative thought?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful and less anxious. It's still tough, but it helps to remind myself of what I've achieved so far.

Therapist: That's great to hear. Remember, our thoughts have a significant impact on our emotions, so it's essential to challenge those automatic negative thoughts and find a more balanced perspective. Now, let's discuss how you can apply this thought record technique to manage similar situations in the future.

Patient: I think I can use this technique before important meetings or when I start feeling overwhelmed. It might help me stay grounded and focused on what I can control.

Therapist: Absolutely! You can use this technique to challenge your anxious thoughts as they arise, and it can also be helpful to practice this skill regularly, even when you're not feeling particularly anxious. The more you practice, the easier it will become to identify and challenge those negative thoughts in the moment.

Now, let's shift our focus to communicating with Michael. You mentioned earlier that you feel like you're not giving him enough of yourself right now. Can you tell me more about that?

Patient: It's hard to explain, but I feel like I'm always distracted by my business worries. I know Michael is trying to be supportive, but I can't help feeling guilty that I'm not giving him the attention he deserves. We used to talk about everything, but now it's just small talk about chores and bills.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling pulled in multiple directions, with your business worries taking up a lot of your mental energy, and that's affecting your connection with Michael. This is a common issue for many people dealing with depression and anxiety. The fact that you're aware of this challenge is a positive sign, as it allows us to work on it together.

One way to start improving communication with Michael is to set aside dedicated time each day for meaningful conversations with him, away from the distractions of work and daily responsibilities. This could be in the form of a nightly conversation where you check in with each other about your days and share anything that's been on your mind. It might feel unnatural at first, but with practice, it can become a regular and meaningful part of your routine.

Another strategy is to practice active listening when Michael is talking to you. This means giving him your full attention, avoiding distractions, and expressing empathy for his perspective. By showing him that you value his input and feelings, you may find that he is more open and willing to listen when you share your own challenges with him.

What do you think about these ideas? Do you feel like they could be helpful in improving your communication with Michael?

Patient: I think setting aside dedicated time for conversations could really help. It might feel awkward at first, but I know we both need that connection. I'll try to be more present when we talk and see how it goes.

Therapist: That's great, Samantha. Remember, improving communication takes time and practice, so don't expect it to be perfect right away. It's a process of learning and growing together.

Now, I'd like to introduce a new technique that can help you manage your anxiety and stress related to your business. It's called the "worry time" technique. The idea is to set aside a specific, limited amount of time each day to focus on your worries and write them down. This could include potential scenarios, negative thoughts, and possible solutions.

The key is to restrict your worrying to this designated time, while actively postponing worries outside of this time. When you notice worries arising during the day, remind yourself that you've set aside time to address them later, and let the thought go until your scheduled worry time.

During your worry time, allow yourself to fully engage with your worries and write them down. When you feel like you've explored them sufficiently, challenge the negative thoughts using the thought record technique we discussed earlier.

How do you feel about giving this technique a try?

Patient: I think it could be helpful. I often find myself worrying all day long, so having a specific time to focus on it might make it more manageable. I'll give it a try and see how it goes.

Therapist: That's great, Samantha. Remember, the goal is not to completely eliminate worries, as they are a normal part of life. Instead, the worry time technique helps to contain and manage your worries, reducing the impact they have on your anxiety and stress levels.

As you practice this technique, it may be helpful to start with a short worry time, such as 15-20 minutes, and gradually increase it as you become more comfortable with the process. It's also important to be consistent and set aside the same time each day for your worry time, as this can help establish a routine.

Would you like to try the worry time technique for homework this week, along with the thought record technique we discussed earlier?

Patient: Yes, I'll try both techniques this week. I think they could really help me manage my anxiety and improve my communication with Michael.

Therapist: That's great, Samantha. Remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself as you practice these techniques. It's okay if it feels challenging or awkward at first. The more you practice, the more natural it will become.

Before we wrap up, let's summarize what we've discussed today. We started by exploring your anxiety related to your business and practiced using a thought record to challenge your anxious thoughts. We then discussed strategies for improving communication with Michael, including setting aside dedicated conversation time and practicing active listening.

For homework, you'll be practicing the thought record technique, setting aside worry time to manage your anxieties, and having a nightly conversation with Michael where you check in with each other about your days. How are you feeling about your progress and the plan we've established today?

Patient: I feel a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. There's so much to focus on, and I'm worried I might forget something or not do it right. But I know these techniques can help, so I'll do my best to stick with them.
