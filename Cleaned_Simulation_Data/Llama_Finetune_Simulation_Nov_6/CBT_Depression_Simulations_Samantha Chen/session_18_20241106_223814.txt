Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again for our 18th session. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last meeting. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me during our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to working with you and supporting your mental health journey. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to the homework you gave me, especially the "worry time" and the 9 PM work cut-off. It's been tough, but I think it's helping a bit. I've noticed that I'm not as anxious during the day, but I'm still having trouble sleeping at night. I'm also trying to add that daily self-care activity, like walking during lunch, but sometimes I get so caught up in work that I forget.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been making an effort to implement the techniques we discussed, even though it's challenging at times. It's understandable that you're noticing some improvements during the day, but still having trouble with sleep. Changing long-standing habits takes time and consistent effort, so it's okay if you're not seeing changes overnight. I'm here to support you through this process.

For today's session, I'd like to suggest that we focus on three main topics. First, we can explore the sleep difficulties you're experiencing and how they might be related to the racing thoughts you've been having. Second, let's discuss the challenges you're facing with self-care activities and how we can find ways to make them more manageable. Finally, I'd like to check in about your work-life balance and the progress you've made with setting boundaries. How does that sound to you?

Patient: That sounds good. I'm open to discussing all those topics. Let's start with the sleep difficulties and racing thoughts. I've been trying to follow the sleep hygiene practices, but I still find myself lying awake at night, thinking about everythingâ€”my business, my family, even things that happened years ago. It's like my mind won't shut off, and I end up feeling even more exhausted the next day.

Therapist: It sounds like the racing thoughts are really impacting your ability to get a good night's sleep. This is a common challenge for many people who struggle with anxiety and depression. The good news is that there are techniques we can use to help manage these thoughts and make sleep more attainable.

One technique that can be helpful is called "thought stopping." It involves recognizing when your thoughts are becoming overwhelming and using a specific phrase or action to interrupt them. For example, you could try saying "stop" to yourself or even imagining a big red stop sign when you notice your mind racing. Then, try to focus on something more neutral, like the sensation of your body in your bed or the sound of the air conditioning. We can practice this technique together during our session if you'd like.

Patient: That sounds interesting. I've never tried anything like that before. I'm willing to give it a shot. So, when I notice my thoughts are racing, I just say "stop" to myself or imagine a stop sign? And then what? Do I try to think about something else, or just let my mind go blank?

Therapist: Exactly! When you've interrupted the racing thoughts, you can try focusing on something else, like you mentioned. It could be something simple, like repeating a calming phrase to yourself, like "I am relaxed" or "I am at peace." The goal is to distract your mind from the racing thoughts and give yourself permission to unwind. It might feel a little awkward at first, but with practice, it can become a helpful tool for managing your sleep.

Another technique we can try is progressive muscle relaxation. This involves systematically tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body, starting from your toes and working your way up to your head. The idea is to help release physical tension that might be contributing to the racing thoughts. We can go through this exercise together during our session as well.

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I appreciate you taking the time to explain these techniques to me in detail. I'm willing to try both thought stopping and progressive muscle relaxation. Maybe we can start with thought stopping first since that seems more straightforward. I can imagine a big red stop sign when my thoughts start racing. But what should I focus on after I stop the thoughts? Could you give me an example of a calming phrase I can use?

Therapist: You've made a great observation about the connection between work-related stress and sleep difficulties. When we're constantly thinking about work, it's harder for our minds to relax and unwind at night. 

Let's explore this a bit further. Can you tell me more about the work-related thoughts that tend to keep you up at night? Are there any particular worries or concerns that tend to be recurring themes?

Patient: Sure, there are a few recurring themes that keep me up at night. One of the biggest ones is worrying about whether my business will succeed. I've invested so much of my savings and taken out loans, so the financial pressure is huge. I also worry about making the right decisions for the company, like which fabrics to use or which marketing strategies to pursue. And then there's the guilt about not spending enough time with my partner, Michael. I feel like I'm neglecting him because I'm always working or thinking about work.

Therapist: It's understandable that these concerns are keeping you up at night. That's a lot of stress to deal with on a daily basis. What you're describing is a common pattern - the worries about work and the worries about your personal relationships seem to be closely connected. 

Let's try to break this down a bit more. When you're lying in bed at night and the thoughts about your business come up, what typically happens? Do you find yourself getting caught up in the worries, going over scenarios in your head, trying to solve all the potential problems?

Patient: Yes, exactly. I start thinking about all the things that could go wrong and then I try to come up with solutions in my head. It's like I'm trying to solve every problem before it even happens. I go over different scenarios, like what if the fabric supplier delays the shipment, or what if our marketing campaign doesn't reach enough people. And then I start thinking about how I can prevent those things from happening. It's exhausting, and by the time I realize it, it's already 2 or 3 AM.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Samantha. You've identified that this pattern of problem-solving can actually be exhausting and keep you up much later than you intended. This is something we can work on changing. One technique that can be helpful is called "worry time," where you set aside a specific time each day to focus on your worries and concerns. During this designated "worry time," you allow yourself to think about the issues that are weighing on you, but outside of that time, you practice letting those thoughts go.

Patient: That sounds like a good idea. So, I would set aside a specific time during the day to worry about everything, and then try not to think about it the rest of the time? How do I make sure I stick to that? And what if I start worrying outside of that designated time?

Therapist: That's a great question. One way to make sure you stick to the worry time is to create a "worry list" during your designated time. Write down all the concerns or worries that come up, and then set the list aside outside of the worry time. When you notice worries outside of that time, remind yourself that you'll address them during the worry time and encourage yourself to come back to the present moment.

Another helpful technique is to practice "thought stopping." When you notice yourself starting to worry outside of your designated time, try saying "stop" to yourself or even imagining a big red stop sign. Then, try to focus on something more neutral, like the sensation of your body in your bed or the sound of the air conditioning. We can practice this technique together during our session if you'd like.

Patient: I think I understand. So, I would write down my worries during the worry time and then try to ignore them the rest of the day. And if I start worrying outside of that time, I can say "stop" to myself or imagine a stop sign to stop the thoughts. That makes sense. I can try that. Maybe we can practice the thought stopping technique now, if that's okay with you.

Therapist: Absolutely, let's practice the thought stopping technique together. We can start with a thought that's been bothering you recently. Can you share an example of a worry that keeps coming up for you?

Patient: Sure, one of the worries that keeps coming up is about the fabric supplier. I keep thinking about what if they delay the shipment and it affects our production schedule. It's been on my mind a lot lately.

Therapist: Okay, let's practice stopping that thought. When you notice yourself thinking about the fabric supplier and the shipment, say "stop" to yourself. Imagine a big red stop sign in your mind. Then, try to focus on something else. Maybe focus on the feeling of your feet on the floor or the sound of the air conditioner. It's okay if the thought comes back, the key is to interrupt it and bring your attention back to the present moment.

Patient: Alright, I'll try it. So, I'm thinking about the fabric supplier and the shipment. I say "stop" to myself and imagine a big red stop sign. Then, I focus on the feeling of my feet on the floor. It's a bit hard to stop the thought completely, but I can feel it fading away when I focus on my feet.

Therapist: That's great, Samantha. You just practiced thought stopping successfully. It's normal for the thought to come back, but the key is to interrupt it and bring your attention back to the present moment. With practice, it will become easier to stop the thoughts and refocus on the present.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I think this technique could really help me. I'll try to practice it more often, especially during my worry time. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Therapist: You're welcome, Samantha. Thought stopping and worry time can be very helpful techniques. Remember, it's a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself and keep working on it. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about the self-care activities we discussed last session. You mentioned that you've been trying to add a daily walking break, but it's been challenging at times. Can you tell me more about that? What gets in the way of you taking the walk?

Patient: Sure, I think the main thing that gets in the way is my perfectionism. I feel like I need to be working on something productive all the time, and taking a walk feels like a waste of time. I also worry that if I take a break, I won't be able to get back into the work mindset. It's like I'm afraid of losing momentum.

Therapist: That's a great observation about how your perfectionism might be impacting your ability to take breaks. Perfectionism can be a double-edged sword - it can drive you to do great work, but it can also lead to burnout and anxiety. One way to challenge perfectionism is to practice self-compassion. When you notice perfectionistic thoughts coming up, try to reframe them in a more self-compassionate way. For example, instead of thinking "I need to be working all the time," try saying "I am human, and it's okay for me to take breaks." We can practice this together now if you'd like.

Patient: Yes, I'd like to practice that. So, when I notice myself thinking "I need to be working all the time," I can say "I am human, and it's okay for me to take breaks." Let's try it now. I'm feeling that thought coming up right now. I am human, and it's okay for me to take breaks. It feels a bit strange, but also a bit freeing.

Therapist: That's great, Samantha. You just practiced reframing a perfectionistic thought in a self-compassionate way. It's natural for it to feel a bit strange at first, but with practice, it can become more automatic. Remember, self-compassion is a skill that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and keep practicing.

Another way to challenge perfectionism is to set realistic expectations for yourself. One technique that can be helpful is called "continuum thinking." This involves recognizing that there is a range of possibilities between "perfect" and "total failure," rather than seeing things as all or nothing. For example, instead of thinking "the break has to be perfectly productive," try thinking "the break could be a little bit productive, and that's okay." We can practice this technique together now if you'd like.

Patient: Yes, let's practice that. So, instead of thinking "the break has to be perfectly productive," I can think "the break could be a little bit productive, and that's okay." Let's try it now. I'm thinking about my walking break. The break could be a little bit productive, and that's okay. It feels a bit more manageable now.

Therapist: That's great, Samantha. You just practiced continuum thinking to challenge perfectionism. Recognizing that things don't have to be perfect is an important part of self-care. Remember, self-care is a range of possibilities, not just one extreme or the other. With practice, continuum thinking can help you challenge perfectionistic thoughts and make self-care feel more manageable.

As we wrap up our session today, I want to check in about how you're feeling. What are your main takeaways from our conversation today, and how are you feeling about implementing these techniques in the coming week?

Patient: My main takeaway is that I need to be more self-compassionate and recognize that it's okay to take breaks. I also learned about continuum thinking, which helps me see that things don't have to be perfect. I feel a bit more hopeful about implementing these techniques in the coming week. I'll try to practice self-compassion and continuum thinking during my walking breaks and worry time.

Therapist: That's great, Samantha. I'm glad you found our conversation helpful. Remember, practicing these techniques takes time, so be patient with yourself. If you find that you're struggling to implement them, that's okay. We can always review and adjust as we go. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Before we end our session, let's talk about homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue practicing thought stopping and worry time techniques. Try to set aside 15-20 minutes each day to worry, and outside of that time, practice letting thoughts go. I also encourage you to practice self-compassion and continuum thinking during your walking breaks and any other times you find yourself getting caught up in perfectionism. Finally, continue with the sleep hygiene practices we discussed in our previous sessions. Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?

Patient: No, I don't have any questions or concerns about the homework. I'll try my best to practice thought stopping and worry time, and I'll work on being more self-compassionate during my walking breaks. I'll also continue with the sleep hygiene practices. Thank you, Nova.
