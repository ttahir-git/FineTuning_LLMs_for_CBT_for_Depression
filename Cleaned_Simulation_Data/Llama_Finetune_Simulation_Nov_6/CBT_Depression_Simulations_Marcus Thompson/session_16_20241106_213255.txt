Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for session 16. Thank you for sharing the summary from our previous session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions, and there's a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also want to remind you that since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to listen and support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for the heads-up about your limitations. I appreciate the transparency. Since our last session, I've been juggling a lot, as usual. The stress of balancing my mom's care, my teaching responsibilities, and my kids' needs is still pretty intense. I've been trying to implement some of the strategies we talked about, like reframing those "should" statements and setting boundaries. It's been a mixed bag—some days are better than others. How about we dive into that a bit more?

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan, Marcus. I'm glad to hear that you've been working on implementing some of the strategies we've discussed, even if it's been challenging at times. This past week, I'd like to focus on exploring how stress has been impacting your daily life and emotional well-being. We can also discuss any insights or challenges that have come up as you've been working on reframing "should" statements and setting boundaries. How does that sound for our agenda today?

Patient: That sounds good, Nova. I've definitely noticed that stress has been creeping up on me more than usual. I've been feeling more irritable, especially when things don't go as planned. For example, last week, I had a lesson plan all set, but the projector broke right before class, and I just lost it for a moment. It's like all the pressure just bubbled over. As for the "should" statements, I've been trying to catch myself when I start thinking, "I should be doing more for my mom," or "I should be a better dad." It's tough, but I'm getting better at recognizing them.

Therapist: It's really common for stress to manifest as irritability and impatience, especially when you're dealing with multiple demanding roles in your life. It's great that you're starting to recognize those "should" statements, as they can be a significant driver of stress and self-criticism. Today, I'd like to dive deeper into understanding the thoughts and feelings that arise when you're feeling overwhelmed by stress. We can also discuss some strategies for managing that irritability when it comes up. How does that sound as a plan for our session today?

Patient: That sounds like a solid plan, Nova. I'm all for understanding what's going on when I feel overwhelmed. It's like trying to untangle a knot—the more I can see where it's coming from, the better I can deal with it. So, let's dive in. I'm ready to talk about those thoughts and feelings, and maybe even come up with some new strategies to manage the irritability.

Therapist: You're right, Marcus, it can feel like untangling a knot when we're trying to make sense of our thoughts and feelings. But each time we dig in a bit deeper, we open up new possibilities for understanding and change. Let's start by exploring a situation from this past week when you noticed stress or irritability coming up. Can you walk me through what happened and what thoughts and feelings were going through your mind in that moment?

Patient: Sure, Nova. Let's talk about that projector incident. So, I had this lesson plan all set, and I was feeling pretty good about it. I was excited to share some new material on the civil rights movement, and I had the projector ready to show some historical footage. But then, right before class, the projector just stopped working. I tried to fix it, but nothing worked. That's when the frustration hit me hard. I started thinking, "Why is this happening now? I should have checked it earlier. I should be more prepared." I felt a mix of anger and helplessness, like I was failing my students and myself. It was a small thing, but it felt like the weight of everything else just came crashing down on me in that moment.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Marcus. It sounds like a really challenging situation, and it's understandable that it brought up a lot of difficult thoughts and feelings. Let's break this down a bit, using the CBT triangle we've talked about before. In that moment, what thoughts were going through your mind, and how did they impact your feelings? And then, how did those thoughts and feelings influence your behavior in that situation?

Patient: Alright, let's break it down. So, in that moment, my thoughts were, "Why is this happening now? I should have checked it earlier. I should be more prepared." These thoughts made me feel angry and helpless, like I was failing my students and myself. Those feelings of anger and helplessness then influenced my behavior—I ended up snapping at one of the tech support staff who came to help, even though they were just trying to fix the problem. It was a small thing, but it felt like the weight of everything else just came crashing down on me in that moment.

Therapist: Thank you for breaking that down so clearly, Marcus. It's a great example of how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. Those "should" statements are really standing out to me as the fuel for those difficult feelings of guilt and anger. When we use "should" statements, we're often putting ourselves in a place of judgment or criticism, which can lead to those feelings of distress. Let's explore this a bit more. What do you think would have happened if you had reframed those "should" statements in that moment?

Patient: That's a good question, Nova. I guess if I had reframed those "should" statements, I might have thought something like, "Okay, this is frustrating, but it's just a technical issue. I can still deliver a great lesson without the projector." Instead of feeling angry and helpless, I might have felt more in control and less like a failure. It's easier said than done, but I can see how that shift could have changed my reaction and made the situation less stressful.

Therapist: You've made an excellent point, Marcus. Reframing those "should" statements has the potential to significantly shift how we feel in challenging situations. It's a skill that takes practice, but over time, it can become a powerful tool for managing stress and reducing the impact of those difficult thoughts and feelings. How do you think this reframing could fit into your current stress management plan?

Patient: I think it could fit in really well, Nova. I've been trying to catch those "should" statements when they come up, but I haven't been very systematic about it. Maybe I could start by writing down a few alternative thoughts to use in those moments. For example, instead of "I should have checked the projector earlier," I could remind myself, "It's okay, things happen, and I can still make this lesson work." It's about finding a balance between being prepared and being flexible when things don't go as planned.

Therapist: That's a great idea, Marcus. Writing down some alternative thoughts ahead of time can make it easier to access them in the moment when you're feeling stressed. It's all about finding that balance between being prepared and being resilient in the face of challenges. Another aspect of managing stress is making sure we're taking care of ourselves, both physically and emotionally. How do you think self-care fits into your current stress management plan?

Patient: Self-care is definitely important, Nova. I try to keep up with my exercise routine, especially those early morning runs along Lake Michigan. It helps clear my head and gives me some time to think things through. I also try to spend time with my kids and help out at the community center when I can. But sometimes, I feel guilty about taking time for myself, like I'm neglecting my responsibilities. How do I balance that?

Therapist: You've hit on a great point, Marcus. It's common for people who are very dedicated to their responsibilities to feel guilty about taking time for themselves. This is something we can work on together. One way to approach this is to think about self-care as an investment in your ability to be present and effective in those other areas of your life. Just like you can't pour from an empty cup, you can't fully give to others if you're not also taking care of yourself. It's about finding that balance and recognizing that self-care isn't selfish—it's necessary.

Patient: That makes sense, Nova. I guess I need to reframe how I think about self-care. Instead of seeing it as something I'm neglecting, I should see it as something that helps me be more effective in my responsibilities. It's about being the best version of myself for my students, my kids, and my community. I'll try to keep that in mind moving forward.

Therapist: You've made an important realization, Marcus. Seeing self-care as an investment in your overall effectiveness is a powerful shift in perspective. As we wrap up today's session, let's talk about some homework that can help you continue practicing these skills. First, I'd like you to write down some alternative thoughts for those "should" statements you commonly encounter. Second, I'd like you to plan at least one self-care activity this week, and try to reframe it as an investment in your overall well-being. Finally, let's continue our work on identifying and reframing "should" statements by adding them to your thought record. How does that sound for homework this week?

Patient: That sounds good, Nova. Writing down alternative thoughts for those "should" statements and planning a self-care activity will help me stay focused on this new perspective. I'll also keep up with the thought records to track my progress. Thanks for the guidance.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. Remember, change takes practice and persistence. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's plan to meet again next week and check in on your progress with these homework assignments. In the meantime, if any challenges or questions come up, don't hesitate to bring them to our next session.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the support. I'll see you next week and we can go over how things went with the homework. Take care.
