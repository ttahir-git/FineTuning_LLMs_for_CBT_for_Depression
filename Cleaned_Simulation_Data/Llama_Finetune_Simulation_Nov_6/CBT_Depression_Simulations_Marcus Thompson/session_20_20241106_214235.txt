Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for our 20th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a chance I could generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully here to support you in our work together. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hey, Nova. Thanks for checking in. I've been managing, but it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. The worry time technique has been helping, especially with setting a timer and writing things down. It's like I can actually see my worries on paper and it makes them feel a bit more manageable. But I've noticed that some of my "should" statements are still creeping back in, especially when I'm trying to balance everything with my mom and the kids. It's like I'm constantly telling myself I should be doing more, being more patient, more understanding. And then there's the irritability with my students. I've been trying to practice deep breathing, but sometimes it feels like it's not enough. How do I keep those "should" statements in check?

Therapist: You're doing a great job noticing these patterns and sharing them with me, Marcus. It's really important that we work together to understand your experiences and find strategies to help you manage these challenges. I'm glad to hear the worry time technique has been helpful, and that setting a timer and writing things down has made your worries feel more manageable. Regarding the "should" statements, we've talked about reframing them before, but it's clear that they're still impacting you. Let's explore this further. Can you give me an example of a recent situation where you noticed these "should" statements arising?

Patient: Sure, just the other day, I was at my mom's place, helping her with some things around the house. She was having a tough time remembering how to do something simple, like turning on the TV. And I found myself thinking, "I should be more patient, I should be doing more to help her, I should be able to handle this better." It's like I'm constantly judging myself, and it just adds to the stress. How do I reframe those thoughts?

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Marcus. It's a great opportunity to practice reframing those "should" statements. When we use "should" statements, we're often putting ourselves under a lot of pressure and expecting perfection from ourselves. But the truth is, we're human, and it's okay to struggle sometimes. Let's try to reframe those thoughts using a more compassionate lens. For example, instead of saying, "I should be more patient," you could say, "I'm doing the best I can in a challenging situation." Or, instead of "I should be doing more to help her," you could say, "I'm contributing in the ways I can, and it's okay if I can't do everything." How does that feel for you?

Patient: That actually makes a lot of sense. It's like giving myself a break, right? I can see how saying "I'm doing the best I can" instead of "I should be more patient" could help me feel less overwhelmed. But how do I actually start changing those thoughts? It's one thing to understand it in theory, but another to put it into practice.

Therapist: You're right, Marcus. It's one thing to understand it in theory, but another to put it into practice. That's where consistent practice and awareness come in. One technique we can use is called the "thought record." It's a tool to help you identify your negative thoughts, examine them, and replace them with more balanced, compassionate ones. Here's how it works:.

Patient: - **Step 1: Identify the Situation** - Write down the situation where you had the negative thought.
- **Step 2: Record the Thought** - Write down the negative thought that came up.
- **Step 3: Rate the Belief** - Rate how much you believe the thought on a scale from 0 to 100%.
- **Step 4: Identify the Evidence** - List evidence that supports and contradicts the thought.
- **Step 5: Reframe the Thought** - Write down a more balanced or compassionate thought.
- **Step 6: Rate the New Belief** - Rate how much you believe the new thought on a scale from 0 to 100%.

Let's try it with your example about your mom. Can you walk me through the steps?

Therapist: Great, let's walk through this thought record together. So, in this situation, your negative thought was, "I should be more patient, I should be doing more to help my mom." In step 3, you rated how much you believe this thought on a scale from 0 to 100. How much did you believe it in that moment?

Patient: I'd say I believed it around 80%. It's something I've been telling myself for a while, so it feels pretty strong.

Therapist: Alright, let's move on to step 4. What evidence supports and contradicts this thought? What makes you believe it's true?

Patient: Well, the evidence that supports it is that I do feel like I'm not doing enough, especially when I see her struggling. I feel guilty because I know she needs more help, and I'm not always there for her like I think I should be. The evidence that contradicts it is that I do spend weekends with her, and I've been trying to arrange for more support, like hiring a caregiver for a few hours a week. But those thoughts of not doing enough still overshadow the positive things I'm doing.

Therapist: That's a great observation, Marcus. It's common for our thoughts to feel so true, even when we're doing our best. Now, let's move on to step 5. How can we reframe this thought in a more balanced way? What's a more realistic and compassionate thought?

Patient: Maybe something like, "I'm doing what I can, and it's okay to ask for help when I need it." Or, "I'm contributing in meaningful ways, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes." Those sound more balanced and less harsh.

Therapist: Excellent reframing, Marcus! Now, let's re-rate your belief in the negative thought in step 6. How much do you believe it now, on that same scale of 0 to 100?

Patient: I'd say it's down to about 50%. It's still there, but not as overwhelming as before. It's like a weight has been lifted a bit.

Therapist: That's a great shift, Marcus. This is what happens when we practice reframing. It might not always be easy, but the more you do it, the more natural it becomes. And the more balanced your thoughts feel, the less impact they can have on your emotions and overall well-being.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's definitely something I need to keep working on. It's not easy, but it feels good to see some progress.

Therapist: You're doing an amazing job, Marcus. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have setbacks. What matters is that you keep practicing and bringing your experiences to our sessions. That's how we create lasting change. Now, let's set some homework for this week. I'd like you to continue with the worry time technique, track the impact of reframing on your "should" statements, and practice the thought record whenever you notice those negative thoughts creeping in. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds good. I'll keep track of my thoughts and try to reframe them when I can. It's a lot to keep in mind, but I'll do my best.

Therapist: That's all we can ask for, Marcus. I have confidence in you and your abilities to keep practicing these skills. Remember, it's not about being perfect, but about making small changes that lead to big shifts over time. I'm here to support you every step of the way. How are you feeling about our session today?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful, honestly. It's good to know there are tools to help manage these thoughts. Thanks for your support, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. I'm always here for you. Let's continue to work together to find the best strategies for you. How does that sound for our plan moving forward?

Patient: That sounds good. I'll keep practicing and come back next week to see how it's going. Thanks again, Nova.
