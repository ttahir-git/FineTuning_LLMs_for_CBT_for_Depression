The session focused heavily on exploring the root causes of Marcus's perfectionist tendencies and his struggle with balancing multiple responsibilities. There was significant progress in understanding the origins of his beliefs and beginning to challenge them.

Therapist: Thank you for your hard work today, Marcus. I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in understanding your own thoughts and beliefs. Before we wrap up, I'd like to do a final check-in on your current emotional state. How are you feeling now?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate that. Right now, I'm feeling a mix of things. There's a bit of relief knowing I'm starting to understand where some of these feelings come from, but there's also this lingering sense of guilt and pressure, like I'm still not doing enough. Emotionally, I'd say I'm at about a 60 out of 100. It's better than before, but still heavy.

Therapist: It's completely normal to feel that way, especially after such a deep dive into your emotions and beliefs. Remember, change takes time, and it's not always a linear process. The fact that you're feeling a bit better than before is a positive sign, and it shows the effort you've put into today's session.

For homework this week, I'd like you to continue practicing the thought record technique and start to challenge those "should" statements when they come up. Try to reframe them as "I want" statements instead. Also, consider engaging in at least one vulnerability practice, like sharing something personal with a trusted friend or family member. This can help you start to see that showing weakness is actually a strength, as it allows you to build deeper connections and understanding.

Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?

Patient: Thanks for the encouragement, Nova. I'll definitely keep working on those thought records and challenging the "should" statements. It's been helpful to see how much they affect my mood and stress levels.

As for the vulnerability practice, I'm a bit hesitant. I've always been the strong one, the one people come to for support. Sharing something personal feels... risky. But I understand the importance of it. Maybe I'll start small, like sharing a concern about my mom's condition with a close friend.

Any tips on how to approach that without feeling too exposed?

Therapist: I'm glad to hear you'll be working on the thought records and challenging "should" statements. That's a great goal. Regarding the vulnerability practice, starting small, as you mentioned, can be a great way to ease into it.

When I think of sharing a concern about your mom's condition, it seems like a very understandable and natural thing to do with a close friend. It's just about giving yourself permission to be open and honest. You might even consider how your friend would respond in a similar situation. Would you feel more comfortable sharing with someone who had gone through a similar experience?

Patient: Yeah, that makes sense. I think I'd feel more comfortable sharing with someone who's been through something similar. My friend Jamal, who I play basketball with, has been through some tough family stuff too. Maybe I'll talk to him about it. He's always been a good listener.

Thanks for the advice, Nova. I'll give it a try and see how it goes.

Therapist: I think that could be a great option. Being able to relate to each other's experiences can create a deeper understanding and support. Remember, it's okay to take your time and share only what feels comfortable. You're in control of your own boundaries and limits.

Before we wrap up, I want to check in one last time. How are you feeling now?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I feel a bit more at ease knowing I have a plan for the week. Still a bit anxious about the vulnerability practice, but I think it's a step in the right direction. Overall, I'd say I'm at about a 55 out of 100 now. It's progress, and I'll take it.
