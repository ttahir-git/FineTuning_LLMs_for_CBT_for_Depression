Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again. Thank you for sharing the summary from our previous session. Before we dive into today's topics, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made and the challenges you've been facing. Being a caregiver for your mother while also managing your academic responsibilities and family life is a monumental task. I appreciate your openness in sharing your struggles and your willingness to work on developing healthier coping mechanisms.
In our previous session, we discussed the emotional toll of caring for your mother and the balancing act you've been performing with your multiple responsibilities. We also explored stress eating and the guilt that accompanies it. Our main goals were to help you manage your emotions and care for yourself while still fulfilling your caregiving duties.
For today's session, I'd like to suggest a few topics based on the points you've raised and the progress we've made so far. These include:

1. Expanding on the concept of self-compassion and practicing reframing negative thoughts related to caregiving.
2. Identifying additional coping strategies for managing stress and emotions, focusing on being present and engaged with your family.
3. Exploring ways to set realistic goals and prioritize tasks to help balance your responsibilities.

What do you think about these suggestions? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?

###.

Patient: Thanks for the acknowledgment, Nova. It's been tough, but I'm trying to stay positive and keep moving forward. I appreciate the suggestions for today's session.

1. **Self-compassion and reframing negative thoughts**: I'm still working on this. It's hard to let go of the guilt, especially when I feel like I'm not doing enough for my mom or my kids. Can you give me an example of how to reframe a negative thought?

2. **Additional coping strategies**: I've been trying to be more present with my family, but it's a constant struggle. Any specific techniques you recommend for staying engaged?

3. **Setting realistic goals and prioritizing tasks**: This is something I really need help with. I tend to take on too much and then feel overwhelmed. Can we focus on practical steps to set realistic goals and prioritize my responsibilities?

I think these topics will help, but I'm open to anything else that might come up. Thanks for your support, Nova.

Therapist: You're right, it's essential to practice reframing negative thoughts and developing self-compassion consistently. Let's take a real-life example from your experience and work on reframing it together. Can you share a specific situation where you felt guilty or like you weren't doing enough?

Patient: Sure, Nova. One situation that comes to mind is when I had to miss my mom's doctor's appointment last week. I had a parent-teacher conference at school, and I couldn't reschedule it. I felt terrible about it, like I was letting her down. I kept thinking, "I should be there for her no matter what."

Therapist: That's a common situation for caregivers, and the guilt you feel is understandable. Let's try reframing that thought using the "should" technique. Can you think of an alternative way to express your commitment to your mom without using "should"?

Patient: Hmm, let me think. Instead of saying "I should be there for her no matter what," maybe I could say, "I want to be there for her as much as possible, but I also need to fulfill my responsibilities at school."

Therapist: That's a great reframe, Marcus! It acknowledges your commitment to your mom while also recognizing the importance of your own needs and responsibilities. This shift in language can help reduce the intense guilt you feel when you can't be there every time.
Now, let's explore some additional coping strategies for staying engaged with your family. One effective technique is called "mindful presence." It involves focusing on the present moment and engaging in activities with your children in a fully aware and attentive way. This could be through playing a game, asking them about their day, or even just sitting silently together.

Another strategy is to practice gratitude. Take a few minutes each day to reflect on things you appreciate about your children and your relationship with them. This can help you stay connected emotionally, even when you can't be physically present.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I like the idea of mindful presence. It sounds like something I can easily incorporate into my routine. I'll try to be more present when I'm with my kids, even if it's just for a few minutes each day.

And practicing gratitude is something I've been meaning to do more of. I think it will help me appreciate the good moments more and maybe ease some of the stress.

Do you have any specific exercises or prompts for practicing gratitude?

Therapist: Here's a simple gratitude exercise you can try:

1. Take a few minutes each evening before bed to reflect on the day.

2. Write down three things you're grateful for. These can be small moments, like seeing a funny cartoon shared by your child, or larger things, like your mother's progress with her condition.

3. For each item, write a brief sentence explaining why you're grateful for it.

By doing this consistently, you'll start to train your brain to focus on the positive aspects of your life, even amidst challenges.

Patient: That sounds manageable, Nova. I can definitely try that before bed. It's a good way to end the day on a positive note.

I'll start tonight and see how it goes. Thanks for the suggestion.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. I'm glad you find it helpful. Remember, practicing gratitude is a skill that develops with time and repetition. It may not always be easy, but it can make a significant difference in your overall well-being.

Now, let's discuss setting realistic goals and prioritizing tasks. This is an essential skill for managing multiple responsibilities and reducing stress.

One technique I find helpful is creating a "coping card." This is a small, portable reminder of your goals, self-care practices, and coping strategies. You can write down specific goals related to caregiving, studying, and family life, and create a list of self-care activities you can engage in when feeling overwhelmed.

On the back of the card, you can write down your self-compassionate statements and coping strategies, like the "should" reframing technique we discussed earlier.

Patient: A coping card sounds like a practical tool, Nova. I can see how it would help keep my goals and strategies in mind, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed.

Can you give me an example of what a coping card might look like? I think seeing one would help me understand how to create my own.

Therapist: Sure, let me create a hypothetical example of a coping card:
- Goals:
    - Study for at least 2 hours a day, 5 days a week.
    - Spend at least 30 minutes with each child every day, engaging in quality one-on-one time.
    - Be an attentive caregiver to my mother, ensuring her basic needs are met and helping her with activities of daily living.
- Self-Care Activities:
    - Take a 15-minute walk outdoors every day.
    - Practice deep breathing for 5 minutes, twice a day.
    - Reach out to a friend for emotional support once a week.
- Coping Strategies:
    - When feeling overwhelmed, take a 5-minute break to practice mindful breathing.
    - Use the "should" reframing technique to challenge negative thoughts.
    - Create a list of tasks for each day, focusing on one or two most important items first.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. That example really helps clarify what a coping card should include. I'll start working on mine tonight.

One thing I'm still struggling with is finding time for exercise. I know it's important for my mental health, but it feels like there's never enough time in the day. Any suggestions on how to fit it in?

Therapist: Finding time for exercise can be challenging, especially with your busy schedule. Let's brainstorm some ways to incorporate it into your daily routine:

- Wake up 15 minutes earlier and do a short workout before starting your day.
- Take your lunch break for a walk outside, or do a brief stretching routine at your desk during a break.
- Go to bed 15 minutes later and do some light exercises before heading to bed.
- Ask your children if they want to do an active family activity together, like hiking or cycling.
- Use the time your spouse is with your mother to do a workout at home.
- Join a workout class on the weekends or find a group of parents to exercise with.

Patient: Those are some great ideas, Nova. I think waking up 15 minutes earlier could work well. It's a small change, but it might be enough to get me moving.

And involving the kids in active family activities is a good way to spend quality time with them while also getting exercise. I'll definitely look into that.

Thanks for the suggestions. I'll start implementing them and see how it goes.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. Remember, even small changes can make a big difference in your overall well-being. As we continue to work together, we can explore additional strategies for managing your responsibilities and prioritizing self-care.

Speaking of which, let's revisit the concept of self-compassion. Last session, we discussed reframing negative thoughts using the "should" technique. This time, I'd like you to focus on practicing self-compassion when you notice yourself being self-critical.

To start, imagine what you would say to a close friend or loved one who was in your situation. Chances are, you would offer them understanding and kindness. Now, try to extend that same compassion to yourself.

For example, if you missed a parent-teacher conference, instead of saying, "I'm a failure for not being there," you could say, "I'm doing the best I can with a lot on my plate. It's okay if I can't be in every place at once."

Can you think of a situation where you could practice self-compassion?

Patient: That's a good point, Nova. I tend to be harder on myself than I would be on someone else.

One situation where I could practice self-compassion is when I miss a deadline for a school project. I often feel like I'm letting my students down, but I know I'm doing the best I can with everything else going on.

Instead of beating myself up, I could remind myself that I'm juggling a lot and that it's okay to ask for help or adjust my expectations.

Therapist: That's a great example, Marcus. Recognizing that self-compassion is essential, especially when facing multiple responsibilities. It's a skill that takes practice, but over time, it can help you develop a kinder, more understanding relationship with yourself.

One way to practice self-compassion is through loving-kindness meditation. This involves repeating phrases of kindness and well-wishes towards yourself and others, such as "May I be happy, healthy, and at peace."

I'd like you to try a short loving-kindness meditation now, focusing on self-compassion. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and repeat the following phrases:

"May I be safe from harm.
May I be happy and at peace.
May I be healthy and strong.

And may I treat myself with kindness and compassion, even on challenging days.".

Patient: Sure, Nova. I'll give it a try.

(Closes eyes, takes a deep breath, and repeats the phrases silently)

May I be safe from harm.
May I be happy and at peace.
May I be healthy and strong.

And may I treat myself with kindness and compassion, even on challenging days.

(Opens eyes)

That was actually quite calming. It's a good reminder to be gentle with myself, especially when things get tough.

Therapist: I'm glad you found it helpful, Marcus. Loving-kindness meditation is a powerful tool for cultivating self-compassion and promoting a sense of inner peace.

As we continue to work together, we'll explore additional ways to incorporate self-compassion into your daily life. Remember, it's a skill that develops with practice, and small steps can lead to significant changes in your overall well-being.

One situation where I could practice self-compassion is when I'm feeling overwhelmed by my responsibilities. Instead of thinking, "I should be able to handle everything on my own," I could remind myself that it's okay to ask for help and that I'm doing the best I can.

I'll try to keep that in mind the next time I'm feeling stressed.

On the back of the card, you can write down your self-compassionate statements and coping strategies, like the "should" reframing technique we discussed earlier.

Can you think of a situation where you could use a coping card as a reminder of your goals and strategies?

Patient: A coping card sounds like a practical idea. I can use it to remind myself of my priorities and strategies during my weekends with my mother. This often feels overwhelming because there are so many things to remember. For instance, I could write down my goal to ensure she takes her medications on time, my self-care activity of taking a short walk with her, and my coping strategy of practicing mindful breathing if I start feeling stressed. It would be a tangible way to keep my self-compassionate statements and coping strategies in mind.

Therapist: That's a great example, Marcus. Using the coping card during your weekend with your mother can help you feel more prepared and less overwhelmed. It's a way to simplify your responsibilities and focus on one task at a time.

As we wrap up today's session, let's discuss your homework for the next week. I'd like you to continue practicing the "should" reframing technique and self-compassion exercises we discussed today. Additionally, I encourage you to create a coping card for your weekend with your mother and use it as a reminder of your goals, self-care activities, and coping strategies.

We'll also continue to work on identifying and challenging negative thoughts related to stress eating and the belief that you should be able to handle everything on your own. To start, I'd like you to keep a thought record for the next week, where you write down the situation, your emotions, and the negative thoughts that arise.

How does that sound? Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?

Patient: That sounds good, Nova. I'll definitely work on creating the coping card and using it during my weekends with my mother.

I do have a question about the thought record. How detailed should I be when writing down the situation and my emotions? Should I include specific details about what I was doing and feeling at the time?

Therapist: You can be as detailed as you feel comfortable with, Marcus. It's not about capturing every single moment, but rather highlighting the situation or trigger that led to the negative thought. For example, if you were feeling overwhelmed at school, you could write "Feeling overwhelmed at school" as the situation. Then, you can elaborate on the emotions you experienced in that moment.

The goal is to help us identify patterns and common triggers for your negative thoughts so we can start to challenge them and develop more balanced ways of thinking.

Patient: Got it, Nova. I'll make sure to include enough detail to help identify those patterns. Thanks for the clarification.
