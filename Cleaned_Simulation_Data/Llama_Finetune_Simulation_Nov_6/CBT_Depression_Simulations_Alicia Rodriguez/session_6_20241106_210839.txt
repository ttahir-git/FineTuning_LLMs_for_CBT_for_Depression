Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again for our sixth session. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi, Nova. Thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your honesty. Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to the work schedule we discussed, but it's been tough. I ended up working late again last night, even though I promised myself I wouldn't. I feel guilty about it, like I'm not doing enough.

Therapist: It's understandable to feel guilty, but I want to emphasize that setting boundaries is a process, and it takes time to change long-standing patterns. The fact that you acknowledged your need to set boundaries and made a plan to follow through is already a significant step forward. Let's explore what made it challenging for you to stick to your work schedule, and how we can work on making it more manageable. Can you tell me more about what happened last night?

Patient: Sure. Last night, I was reviewing some code for a new project, and I just couldn't stop. I kept finding things I wanted to fix or improve, and before I knew it, it was past midnight. I felt like if I didn't finish, I wasn't doing my job right. I know it's not healthy, but it's hard to break the habit.

Therapist: That's a great observation, Alicia. The habit of overworking is something we can work on together. Let's break down what happened last night and see if we can identify any thoughts or beliefs that contributed to it. Before we do that, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to focus on today?

Patient: I think I'd like to focus on how to better manage my time and avoid overworking. I also want to talk more about how to internalize positive feedback and not just dismiss it. It feels like I'm stuck in this loop of self-doubt and perfectionism, and I want to find a way out.

Therapist: Those are great topics to focus on today. Let's start with your experience last night and work our way up to larger patterns and beliefs. Can you walk me through the thoughts you had as you were reviewing your code?

Patient: Sure. As I was reviewing the code, I kept thinking, "This isn't good enough," and "I need to make it perfect." I also felt like if I didn't put in extra hours, I wouldn't be seen as a good team lead. It's like I'm constantly trying to prove myself, even though I know logically that I'm capable.

Therapist: It sounds like those thoughts and beliefs are closely tied to your perfectionism and the pressure you put on yourself. Let's explore those further. When you say, "This isn't good enough," what evidence do you have that supports that thought?

Patient: Well, I can always find something to improve, no matter how small. But I guess the evidence that it is good enough is that the code works, it meets the project requirements, and my team is satisfied with it. It's just hard to see that when I'm so focused on the flaws.

Therapist: That's a great point about being focused on flaws rather than the positive aspects of your work. It's also important to recognize that the code working and meeting project requirements is evidence that it is good enough. Let's try an exercise called "deepening the positive" to help you focus on the strengths of your work and the positive feedback you receive. Are you open to trying that?

Patient: Yes, I'm open to trying it. What exactly does that involve?

Therapist: "Deepening the Positive" involves intentionally focusing on the positive aspects of a situation or experience. It's a technique that helps you challenge the habit of discounting positive feedback and recognizes your accomplishments and strengths. We'll start by identifying a recent situation where you received positive feedback or a success, then we'll explore the evidence that supports that positive perspective and consider how that evidence challenges the negative thoughts you often have about your work. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds helpful. Let's do it. A recent situation where I received positive feedback was when I presented our project at a company meeting. My boss praised the clarity of my presentation and the innovative approach we took. I initially dismissed it because I thought it was just expected of me, but now I see that it was a genuine compliment.

Therapist: That's a great example, Alicia. You identified a situation where you received positive feedback and acknowledged the evidence that supports the positive perspective - the clarity of your presentation and the innovative approach. Now, let's explore the thoughts that came up when your boss praised you. What was going through your mind at that moment?

Patient: I was thinking, "This is just part of my job," and "Anyone could have done this." But now I realize that not everyone could have presented it with the same clarity and innovation. It's a skill I have, and it's something to be proud of.

Therapist: That's an excellent point, Alicia. You recognized the skill you bring to your work and acknowledged that it sets you apart from others. This is a great example of deepening the positive and challenging the negative thoughts. As we continue to practice this technique, you'll find it easier to internalize positive feedback and recognize your accomplishments. Let's continue to explore how this can be applied to other situations in your life.

### In the next session, we'll review your progress with this technique and discuss any challenges you've encountered. We'll also continue to work on challenging the cognitive distortions related to perfectionism and self-doubt.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I feel like this exercise helped me see things a bit differently. I'll keep practicing and look forward to our next session.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad to hear that you found this exercise helpful. Remember, the goal is to practice and apply these techniques in your daily life. The more you do it, the easier it will become. Let's continue to work together to find the right balance between setting boundaries and prioritizing your well-being.

Patient: I appreciate that, Nova. It's definitely something I need to work on. Setting boundaries is hard for me, especially when I feel like I need to prove myself constantly. But I know it's important for my well-being.

Therapist: You're right, Alicia. Setting boundaries is a process, and it takes time and practice. It's not always easy, but it's crucial for maintaining your mental health and overall well-being. Let's continue to explore how you can set boundaries while also honoring your values and commitments. Remember, it's about finding the right balance for you.

Patient: I understand. It's about finding that balance, not just for my well-being, but also to be more effective at work. I'll keep working on it and let you know how it goes in our next session.

Therapist: Absolutely, Alicia. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Let's continue to work on this together. For now, I'd like to focus on some cognitive restructuring to help you challenge the negative thoughts that arise when you're trying to set boundaries at work. Can you think of a recent situation where you wanted to set a boundary but had difficulty doing so? Let's break it down together.

Patient: Sure, Nova. A recent situation was when I was asked to take on an additional project outside of my regular work hours. I initially agreed because I didn't want to seem uncooperative, but it left me feeling overwhelmed and stressed. I realized later that I should have set a boundary, but I didn't know how to do it without feeling guilty.

Therapist: Thank you, Alicia, for sharing that example. It's a common challenge for many people - the fear of seeming uncooperative or not meeting expectations. Let's break this down using a thought record. First, can you identify the thoughts and emotions that came up when you agreed to take on the additional project?

Patient: When I agreed to take on the additional project, I had thoughts like, "I need to prove myself," and "I can't let my team down." The emotions were a mix of anxiety and guilt, especially when I started feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist: Okay, let's write those down in the thought record. Now, let's look at the evidence that supports or refutes those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you need to prove yourself or that you'll let your team down if you don't agree to take on the project?

Patient: Well, I have evidence that I'm competent and capable, given my recent promotion and the positive feedback I've received. But I also have evidence that taking on too much can lead to burnout and mistakes, which could negatively impact my team. So, it's a bit of a mixed bag.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Alicia. You've identified the evidence on both sides. Now, let's look at how we can reframe those thoughts based on the evidence. What would be a more balanced or alternative thought in this situation?

Patient: A more balanced thought might be, "I can be a valuable team member without taking on every extra task. Setting boundaries can actually help me be more effective and avoid burnout."

Therapist: That's a great alternative thought, Alicia. It acknowledges your value as a team member while also recognizing the importance of self-care and boundary-setting. How does that thought feel compared to the original ones?

Patient: It feels more empowering and less stressful. It's like I'm giving myself permission to take care of myself without feeling guilty.

Therapist: Exactly, Alicia. That's the power of cognitive restructuring. It helps us challenge the negative thoughts that keep us stuck and limits our potential. As you practice this technique, you'll find it easier to set boundaries and prioritize your well-being. Remember, it's about finding that balance and being assertive in a way that aligns with your values.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I think I'm starting to see how this can help me in other areas too, like dealing with my grief and anxiety. It's like I'm learning to be kinder to myself.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Alicia. Recognizing the connection between self-care, boundary-setting, and overall well-being is a significant step forward. As we continue to work together, we'll explore how this applies to various situations in your life. For now, let's practice applying this technique to another situation where you might feel challenged in setting boundaries, and see how it feels.

Patient: Sure, let's try it with something else. How about when I cancel my salsa classes because I feel too tired or overwhelmed?

Therapist: Okay, that's a great example. Let's break it down using the thought record. What thoughts and emotions come up when you consider canceling your salsa classes?

Patient: When I think about canceling, I feel guilty and like I'm letting myself down. I worry that I'm becoming too isolated and that I'm losing touch with my cultural roots.

Therapist: Those are valid concerns, Alicia. Let's write those down in the thought record. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you're letting yourself down or that you're becoming too isolated?

Patient: Well, I haven't been to a class in weeks, and I feel like I'm missing out on something important. But on the other hand, I've been really exhausted and it's been hard to find the energy to go.

Therapist: That's a good point, Alicia. The exhaustion and fatigue may be legitimate reasons not to attend the classes. Let's consider an alternative thought based on the evidence. What would be a more balanced way of looking at this situation?

Patient: Maybe I could see it as a temporary pause rather than a permanent withdrawal. I can still reconnect with salsa when I feel more energized.

Therapist: That's a great alternative thought, Alicia. It acknowledges your desires while also recognizing your current limitations. How does that thought feel compared to the original ones?

Patient: It feels a bit more manageable. I don't feel as guilty, and it gives me hope that I can return to it when I'm in a better place.

Therapist: That's wonderful, Alicia. This is a great example of how cognitive restructuring can help you find a balance between your desires and your current circumstances. As you continue to practice this technique, you'll find it easier to manage your emotions and set boundaries that align with your well-being.

Patient: You're right, Nova. Balancing my desires and my current limitations feels more realistic. I can see that by acknowledging my fatigue, I'm not completely rejecting the idea of dancing but simply adjusting my expectations for now. It feels less like failure and more like self-compassion. I think this approach could really help me in other areas too, like work and socializing.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Alicia. Recognizing the connection between self-compassion and balanced expectations is a significant step forward. As we continue to work together, we'll explore how this applies to various situations in your life. For now, let's practice this technique with another example to solidify your understanding.

### In the next session, we'll review your progress with this exercise and discuss any challenges you've encountered. We'll also continue to work on cognitive restructuring and self-compassion as it relates to your experiences with loss, anxiety, and boundary-setting.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate the support and guidance. I'm looking forward to our next session and continuing to work on these techniques.
