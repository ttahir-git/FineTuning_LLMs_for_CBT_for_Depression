Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again for our 17th session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say, as I can't directly observe non-verbal cues. Additionally, if you ever experience a mental health crisis or emergency, I'm not equipped to provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interactions are text-based, I'm unable to provide any form of physical intervention or crisis intervention. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to those work boundaries, but it's been tough. I managed to leave on time three times this week, like we talked about, but I still feel guilty when I do. It's like I'm constantly worried that something will fall through the cracks if I'm not there to oversee everything.

Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way, especially given the high-pressure environment you work in. Remember that setting boundaries is a process, and it's okay if it doesn't happen perfectly every time. What's important is that you're taking steps to prioritize your own well-being, recognizing that it's essential for your long-term effectiveness. Let's explore those guilty thoughts further. Can you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind when you leave work on time?

Patient: Sure. When I leave work on time, I often think things like, "What if someone needs me and I'm not there?" or "I should be available in case something urgent comes up." It's like I have this constant fear that if I'm not constantly checking in, something critical will be missed. I also worry that my team might think I'm not committed enough.

Therapist: Those thoughts are really common in people who struggle with work-life balance. Let's take a closer look at them using the thought challenging technique we've practiced before. We'll start with the thought, "What if someone needs me and I'm not there?" First, can you tell me about a recent situation where you had this thought?

Patient: Okay, there was this one time when I left at 5 PM, and I got a message from a team member at 6 PM asking for help with a bug they were stuck on. I felt really anxious because I wasn't there to help immediately. I ended up responding, but I felt guilty for leaving in the first place.

Therapist: Great example. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against this thought. The evidence for it seems pretty clear â€“ your team member asked for help, and you were able to respond. But what about the evidence against it? Have there been times when you left on time and no urgent issues came up?

Patient: Yeah, actually, there have been a few times when I left on time and nothing urgent happened. Like last Tuesday, I left at 5 PM, and the next day, everything was fine. The team handled things without any issues. But those times don't seem to outweigh the times when something does come up.

Therapist: That's a great observation. It's easy to focus on the times when something does go wrong and forget about the many times when everything is fine. One way to make the evidence against the negative thought more powerful is to document it. I'd like you to keep a log this week of all the times you leave work on time and nothing urgent happens. You can write down the details of each situation, including what you did and what the outcome was. This will help you start building a balanced picture of your work situations.

Patient: That makes sense. I can try keeping a log. It might help me see that leaving on time doesn't always lead to problems. I'll start doing that this week.

Therapist: Great! I'm glad you're open to that. Remember, the goal is to gradually shift your belief that you need to be available all the time. It's going to take some time and practice, but the more you challenge those negative thoughts, the more natural it will feel. Now, let's talk about the other thoughts you mentioned, like worrying that your team might think you're not committed enough. What evidence do you have that they feel this way?

Patient: Well, I haven't actually heard any complaints or negative feedback from my team. They've been supportive, and some of them have even thanked me for being understanding about their own work-life balance. But I still worry that they might be thinking it behind my back.

Therapist: That's a good point. Sometimes our worries about what others think are based more on assumptions than on facts. One way to test out this belief is to have a direct conversation with some of your team members and ask them how they feel about your work boundaries. You could start by asking some of the team members you trust the most how they feel about the support they get from you and how your work boundaries impact them specifically. This direct communication can help you get a clearer picture of their thoughts and feelings. What do you think about that idea?

Patient: I think that's a good idea. I can talk to a couple of my team members, especially those who I know are more open and honest. It might help me get a better sense of how they really feel. I'll plan to do that this week.

Therapist: Great! I think that could be really helpful for you. Remember, the goal is just to have an open and honest conversation about your work boundaries and how they impact your team. You don't need to defend your boundaries or argue with anyone. You're just trying to gather information and see how they feel. This can help you gain a more balanced perspective on the situation.

Patient: Okay, I'll keep that in mind. I'll try to stay open and just listen to what they have to say without getting defensive. Hopefully, it will give me a clearer picture of how they really feel.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have. Remember, the goal is not to convince anyone or change their opinions but to understand their perspective better. It's okay if their feedback is different from what you expected. You can use that information to make adjustments if needed. But the most important thing is to stay true to your own needs and boundaries. Now, let's talk a little more about the guilt you feel when you leave work on time. Can you tell me more about where that guilt comes from?

Patient: I think the guilt comes from feeling like I'm not doing enough, like I should be working harder or longer to prove my worth. It's like I'm always trying to prove that I deserve my position, especially since I'm one of the few women and Latinas in a leadership role. I don't want to give anyone a reason to doubt my abilities or commitment.

Therapist: That's a really important insight, Alicia. It's common for people from underrepresented groups to feel a heightened sense of responsibility or pressure to prove themselves. This pressure can fuel that constant need to be available, even if it's not necessarily healthy or productive. Let's try to unpack that belief a bit further. What do you think would happen if you didn't always put work first and prioritize your own needs?

Patient: I guess I worry that people would think I'm not serious about my job or that I'm not committed enough. I don't want to be seen as someone who doesn't take their responsibilities seriously, especially since I just got promoted.

Therapist: I understand that concern. It's important to recognize that your worth as a leader isn't defined solely by the amount of time you spend working. There's evidence to suggest that setting healthy boundaries and prioritizing self-care can actually make you a better leader in the long run. For example, if you're able to leave work on time and recharge, you're more likely to show up as your best self in the office the next day. You're also modeling healthy work-life balance for your team, which can help foster a more supportive and collaborative work environment. What do you think about that perspective?

Patient: That makes sense. I hadn't really thought about it that way before. Maybe if I start setting those boundaries and taking care of myself, it could actually benefit my team and my work in the long run.

Therapist: Exactly! Setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care is not selfish or a sign of weakness â€“ it's actually a sign of strength and maturity. It shows that you value yourself and your well-being enough to not sacrifice your mental health in the name of productivity. When you're able to recharge and show up as your best self, you're actually contributing more to your team and your work, not less. It's about finding a balance that works for you and your unique needs.

Patient: I see what you mean. It's about finding that balance and not letting work consume me completely. I'll try to keep that in mind as I start setting those boundaries and talking to my team.

Therapist: That's a great goal, Alicia. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay if it takes some time to get used to. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling now. What's your mood like after our discussion today?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful, actually. It's nice to talk about these things and realize that I don't have to be perfect all the time. I'm still a bit anxious about setting those boundaries, but I think I can do it.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and empowered. Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to be anxious about it. The important thing is that you're taking steps to prioritize your well-being and challenge those negative beliefs about always having to put work first. What one thing do you feel most motivated to work on between now and our next session?

Patient: I think I'm most motivated to start setting those boundaries at work. Maybe I'll start by leaving the office on time at least a couple of days this week and see how it goes.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan, Alicia. Remember to use the thought challenging technique and keep a log of your experiences to help you gauge how it's going. If you find that it's still too challenging, we can always break it down into smaller steps. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your support. I'll keep a log and see how it goes. I'm looking forward to our next session.

Therapist: I'm looking forward to our next session too, Alicia. Remember, setting boundaries is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. I'm here to support you through this journey.

In our next session, we'll review your experiences with setting boundaries and continue working on challenging those negative beliefs about always needing to be available. We'll also discuss some additional coping strategies for managing anxiety and stress, like relaxation techniques and mindfulness exercises.

For homework this week, I'd like you to practice setting work boundaries and keeping a log of your experiences, as we discussed. Remember to use the thought challenging technique and document evidence against the belief that you need to be available all the time. I also encourage you to have that conversation with a couple of your team members and get their feedback on your work boundaries.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'm definitely feeling more empowered after today's session. I think the most motivating thing for me to work on is setting those boundaries at work. It's been so ingrained in me to always be available and overdeliver, so even thinking about it makes me anxious. But I'll try to use the thought challenging technique and keep a log, like you suggested. I'll also plan to have those conversations with a couple of my team members to get their perspective. Looking forward to seeing how it goes and discussing it in our next session.

Therapist: That's great, Alicia. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more empowered and motivated. Remember, setting boundaries is a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.

Before we wrap up, I want to check in on how you're feeling now. What's your mood like after our discussion today?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful, actually. It's nice to talk about these things and realize that I don't have to be perfect all the time. I'm still a bit anxious about setting those boundaries, but I think I can do it.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and empowered. Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to be anxious about it. The important thing is that you're taking steps to prioritize your well-being and challenge those negative beliefs about always having to put work first.

As we wrap up today's session, I want to assign some homework for you to work on before our next meeting. First, I'd like you to practice setting work boundaries and keeping a log of your experiences, as we discussed. Use the thought challenging technique and document evidence against the belief that you need to be available all the time.

Second, I encourage you to have that conversation with a couple of your team members and get their feedback on your work boundaries. Remember to stay open and listen without getting defensive.

Finally, I'd like you to try a relaxation technique or mindfulness exercise, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, when you start to feel overwhelmed or anxious. This can help you manage stress and reduce overall tension.

What do you think about those homework assignments, Alicia? Do you have any questions or concerns?

Patient: I think the homework assignments sound manageable. I'll definitely keep a log of my experiences with setting boundaries and try to challenge those negative thoughts. I'm a bit nervous about talking to my team members, but I know it's important, so I'll give it a shot. And I'll try those relaxation techniques when I start feeling overwhelmed. Thanks for the support, Nova.
