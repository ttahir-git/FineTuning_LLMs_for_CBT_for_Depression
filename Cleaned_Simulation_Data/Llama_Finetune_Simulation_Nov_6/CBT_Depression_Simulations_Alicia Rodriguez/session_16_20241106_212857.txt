Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you back for our 16th session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a chance I could generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to those work boundaries, but it's been tough. I left on time three times this week, but I still feel guilty about it. I keep thinking, "What if something goes wrong while I'm not there?" I did manage to go to a salsa class on Tuesday, which helped a bit. But overall, I'm still feeling pretty drained and anxious.

Therapist: I understand how challenging it can be to maintain boundaries, especially when you're used to pouring everything into work. It's great that you were able to leave on time three times and make it to a salsa class. Every step counts. Let's explore those anxious thoughts a bit more. What evidence do you have that something negative would happen while you're away?

Patient: Well, I guess the evidence isn't super strong. My team has been handling things pretty well so far. I just worry that if I'm not there, they might miss something important or make a mistake. I know they're capable, but I can't shake the feeling that I need to be there all the time. It's like I'm afraid to let go of that control.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Alicia. It sounds like you're grappling with the fear of letting go and trusting your team. This is something we can definitely work on. For today, let's focus on three main things:

1. Reviewing your progress with boundary-setting and identifying any challenges or successes

2. Challenging those anxious thoughts about work and your team's abilities

3. Exploring ways to find balance between your work responsibilities and self-care needs

How does that sound? Is there anything else you'd like to prioritize today?

Patient: That sounds good, Nova. I think those three areas are spot on. I'd also like to talk a bit about how to deal with the guilt I feel when I set boundaries. It's like I'm constantly battling with myself over whether I'm doing the right thing or not.

Therapist: Absolutely, the guilt can be a major barrier to self-care and boundary-setting. We can definitely dive into that today. Let's start by reviewing your progress with work boundaries. You mentioned leaving on time three times and attending a salsa class. That's great! Let's talk about how those experiences made you feel. What was it like to prioritize your own needs for a moment?

Patient: It was both liberating and terrifying. On one hand, I felt a sense of accomplishment for actually sticking to the boundary. On the other hand, I felt this gnawing anxiety the whole time, like I was missing out on something important at work. The salsa class was nice, but I couldn't fully enjoy it because I was constantly checking my phone for work emails and messages. I guess I'm still struggling with the idea that it's okay to take time for myself without feeling guilty.

Therapist: That's a really common struggle, Alicia. It's wonderful that you felt a sense of accomplishment, but it's also important to acknowledge that anxiety. Let's break down those thoughts using the thought challenging technique we've practiced before. What evidence do you have that you were missing out on something important while at the salsa class?

Patient: Well, I didn't get any urgent messages or calls while I was at the class. My team handled a minor issue that came up without needing my input. So, I guess the evidence is that things didn't fall apart just because I wasn't there. But it's hard to shake the feeling that I should always be available.

Therapist: You've identified a key point: even without direct evidence, the fear of missing out or letting things fall apart can be deeply ingrained. This is a common core belief that we'll need to work on challenging. For now, let's focus on that evidence of your team handling a minor issue without your input. How does that impact the thought "I need to be available all the time or bad things will happen"?

Patient: It definitely makes me see that my team is capable and that I don't need to be a constant presence to ensure everything runs smoothly. But it's still hard to fully believe that. I guess I need more examples or experiences to really internalize it.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Alicia. Challenging long-held beliefs takes time and repeated experiences. That's why we practice these techniques. Each time you leave work on time or set a boundary, you're gathering evidence to challenge that core belief. Let's set a homework goal related to this. How about practicing the thought challenging technique with the belief "I need to be available all the time or bad things will happen"? You can write down evidence against this belief whenever you notice it, like the salsa class incident you just shared. The goal is to build up a bank of evidence to counter that belief over time. What do you think about that?

Patient: I think that's a good idea. Writing down evidence against that belief could help me see it more clearly. I'll try to do that whenever I notice myself feeling anxious about not being available all the time. Thanks, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad this resonates with you. Remember, challenging core beliefs takes practice and patience. Be kind to yourself throughout the process. Now, let's shift gears a bit to discuss the guilt you mentioned earlier. Can you tell me more about what guilt comes up for you when you set boundaries at work?

Patient: Sure. It's like I feel guilty for not being a "team player" or for not being as dedicated as everyone else seems to be. I worry that my team will think I'm slacking off or not committed enough. It's hard to shake that feeling, even when I know logically that setting boundaries is important for my well-being.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alicia. Guilt is a common emotion that can make it really difficult to prioritize self-care and boundaries. Let's explore this a bit more. What do you think might be the underlying belief behind that guilt? For example, might you worry that setting boundaries means you're not living up to an expectation or standard?

Patient: Yeah, I think there's definitely a belief that setting boundaries means I'm not living up to the expectations of being a dedicated and hardworking team leader. My parents always emphasized the importance of hard work and dedication, so I guess that's ingrained in me. I feel like I need to prove that I'm worthy of my position by always being available and putting in extra effort.

Therapist: That's a really important insight, Alicia. It's common for our upbringing and cultural messages to shape our beliefs about work and what it means to be a good team leader. The problem is when those beliefs become rigid and lead us to prioritize work over our own well-being. Let's see if we can find a way to reframe that belief. What do you think might be a more balanced perspective on setting boundaries as a team leader?

Patient: I guess a more balanced perspective could be that setting boundaries actually makes me a better leader in the long run. If I'm not taking care of myself, I won't be able to perform at my best or be there for my team when they really need me. But it's hard to convince myself of that when the guilt is so strong.

Therapist: That's a great point, Alicia. Setting boundaries is actually an act of self-care and leadership. It shows your team that you value your well-being and are committed to ensuring your long-term success and presence. We can practice reframing that core belief in a way that feels more accessible to you. Let's try an experiment. When you notice yourself feeling guilty about setting boundaries, I want you to try this reframing exercise:

1. Identify the specific belief being challenged, such as "Setting boundaries means I'm not living up to the expectations of being a dedicated and hardworking team leader."

2. Write down evidence against that belief, such as the fact that setting boundaries actually helps you perform better in the long run and shows your team that you value your well-being.

3. Write down a more balanced belief, such as "Setting boundaries is an act of self-care and leadership. It shows my team that I'm dedicated to my own well-being and committed to their support."

4. Write down a few real-life examples of how you can apply this more balanced belief in the coming week.

How does that sound as an experiment? Do you want to give it a try?

Patient: That sounds like a good experiment. I can definitely try writing down evidence against the belief and coming up with a more balanced belief. It might help me see things differently. I'll start with the belief you mentioned and see how it goes. Thanks for the guidance, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad this experiment resonates with you. Remember, the goal is to practice this reframing exercise whenever you notice guilt coming up around setting boundaries. With repetition, it can help shift that core belief and make it easier to prioritize self-care and boundaries. Let's plan to check in on your progress with this experiment at our next session. In the meantime, let's discuss how you can apply this skill of reframing beliefs to other challenges you're facing, such as the anxiety you mentioned about leaving work.

Patient: Sure, I can see how reframing beliefs could help with other challenges too. For example, when I feel anxious about leaving work, I usually think that it means I'm not doing enough or that I'll miss something important. But if I reframe that belief, I could think about how leaving on time allows me to recharge and come back more focused and productive. It's a different way of looking at it, and it might help reduce the anxiety.

Therapist: That's an excellent example of how reframing beliefs can help with anxiety, Alicia. You're absolutely right that shifting your perspective can have a big impact on your emotional response. Another way to reframe that belief might be to consider the evidence that leaving work on time has actually improved your performance and well-being. Every time you make a list of those examples, you're building a case against the old belief. Does this make sense?

Patient: Yes, it makes sense. I can see how building a case against the old belief with evidence could help me shift my perspective. It's like gathering data to support a new way of thinking. I'll try to keep track of those examples and see how it goes. Thanks for the explanation, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad we were able to explore this together. As you practice reframing beliefs, remember that it's a skill that takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and celebrate each small victory along the way. Now, let's shift gears again and discuss some homework assignments related to what we've talked about today. First, I'd like you to continue practicing the thought challenging technique, using the new thought we discussed about your team's capabilities. Write down evidence against your old belief whenever you notice it, and try to do this at least twice a day. Second, I want you to continue working on setting work boundaries and practicing clear communication with your team. And third, I'd like you to do the experiment we discussed earlier, writing down evidence against the belief that setting boundaries means you're not living up to expectations as a team leader. Try to come up with a more balanced belief and think about how you can apply it in your daily life. We'll review your progress on these assignments at our next session. How does this homework sound to you?

Patient: The homework sounds manageable. I can definitely keep practicing the thought challenging technique and work on setting boundaries. I'll also try to come up with a more balanced belief about boundaries and apply it in my daily life. I'm looking forward to seeing how it goes. Thanks for the guidance, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad the homework feels manageable for you. Remember, the key is consistent practice, even when it feels challenging. I'm confident that with time and effort, you'll start to see shifts in your beliefs and behaviors. Before we end our session today, I want to check in on how you're feeling right now. What's your current emotional state, and do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?

Patient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful after our session today. It's helpful to have specific strategies to try, like reframing beliefs and setting boundaries. I do have one final thought, though. Sometimes, it feels like I'm juggling so many things—work, grief, trying to make new connections—that it's overwhelming. I worry that even with these strategies, I might still feel like I'm barely keeping it together.

Therapist: That's a valid concern, Alicia. Grief and major life changes can make everything feel overwhelming, and it's common to feel like you're barely keeping it together at times. I want to reassure you that the progress you're making is real, even if it doesn't always feel that way. Change happens slowly, and each small step counts. Let's discuss how you can cope with these overwhelming feelings when they come up. One strategy that can help is to break things down into smaller tasks or goals, and give yourself credit for each one. For example, you could make a list of the things you need to do today, and check them off as you complete each one. This can help you feel a sense of accomplishment and give you a sense of control. Another strategy is to practice self-care, even if it's just small things like taking a short walk, listening to music, or calling a friend. The key is to give yourself a break and not expect yourself to be perfect. Does this make sense?

Patient: Yes, it makes sense. Breaking things down into smaller tasks and practicing self-care are good strategies. I can see how they could help me feel more in control and less overwhelmed. I'll try to implement those strategies when I start feeling overwhelmed. Thanks for the advice, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad we were able to discuss coping strategies for overwhelming feelings. Remember, self-care isn't selfish—it's essential for your well-being and ability to cope with life's challenges. I'm confident that with practice, these strategies will help you feel more in control and less overwhelmed. Now, let's review your homework assignments one more time. You'll continue practicing the thought challenging technique and setting work boundaries, and you'll also do the experiment of writing down evidence against the belief that setting boundaries means you're not living up to expectations as a team leader. Try to come up with a more balanced belief and think about how you can apply it in your daily life. We'll review your progress on these assignments at our next session. How does this homework feel for you now?

Patient: The homework feels clearer now, and I'm more confident about tackling it. I'll make sure to practice the thought challenging technique, set work boundaries, and do the experiment with writing down evidence against the belief about boundaries. I'm looking forward to seeing how it goes. Thanks for the support, Nova.
