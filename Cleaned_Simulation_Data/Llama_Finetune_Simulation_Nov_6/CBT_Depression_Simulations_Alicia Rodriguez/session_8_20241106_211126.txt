Therapist: Hello Emilio, it's good to see you again. Before we begin, I want to remind you that as an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a chance I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm committed to doing my best to help you. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to see you too. I've been okay, I guess. I've been trying to keep up with the Positive Data Log, but it's been tough to find consistent positive things to write down. Work has been really hectic, and I've been struggling to set boundaries. I keep feeling like I need to prove myself, especially after the promotion.

Therapist: I understand that it can be challenging to find positive things, especially in the midst of a busy work schedule. Remember, even small things, like taking a moment to breathe or acknowledging a small accomplishment, can be considered positive data. It's a work in progress, and we'll keep working on it together. You mentioned that work has been hectic. How has that been affecting you?

Patient: Work has been really draining. I've been putting in long hours, and it feels like I'm constantly under pressure to perform. I keep thinking that if I don't work harder than everyone else, I'll be exposed as a fraud. It's exhausting, and I'm starting to notice that my concentration is slipping. I've made a few small errors in my code, which is really unlike me.

Therapist: It sounds like the pressure you've been experiencing at work is starting to take a toll on your well-being. The thoughts of being a fraud and the fear of making mistakes seem to be contributing to your fatigue and concentration issues. Let's explore this further. When you think, "If I don't work harder than everyone else, I'll be exposed as a fraud," what emotions do you experience?

Patient: When I have that thought, I feel a mix of anxiety and dread. It's like a constant weight on my shoulders, and it makes me feel like I can't relax or take a break. I worry that if I slow down, people will see that I'm not as capable as they think I am.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Emilio. Those emotions of anxiety and dread can be overwhelming and make it challenging to find a sense of balance and self-care. I wonder if we could use the Evidence-Based Thinking technique to examine this thought further. Would you be open to that?

Patient: Sure, I'm open to trying that. What do I need to do?

Therapist: Great. Let's start by gathering evidence for and against the thought that "If I don't work harder than everyone else, I'll be exposed as a fraud." Can you think of any experiences or situations that challenge this thought?

Patient: Well, there was that time when I took a day off to attend a salsa class, and my team still managed to meet the deadline. My manager even praised our work and didn't seem to notice that I wasn't there the whole day. That kind of challenges the thought, I guess.

Therapist: That's a great example of evidence against the thought. Your team was successful, and your manager didn't seem to notice your absence. This suggests that even with taking a break, your work quality is valued and recognized. Let's continue building on this. Can you think of any additional evidence that challenges the idea that you need to work harder than everyone else to be seen as competent?

Patient: Another example would be when I delegated a project to a team member, and they did an excellent job. It showed that I don't have to do everything myself to ensure success. It also helped build their confidence, which is important for the team's overall performance.

Therapist: Excellent observation, Emilio. Delegating tasks and seeing your team members succeed can demonstrate your leadership and trust in your colleagues. It also contributes to a positive work environment where everyone feels valued and supported. Now, let's look for evidence that supports the thought. Can you think of any instances where working harder made a difference in your performance or perception?

Patient: There was that big project last quarter where I put in extra hours and managed to deliver a high-quality product ahead of schedule. My manager was really impressed and even mentioned it in our performance review. That seems to support the idea that working harder can lead to positive outcomes.

Therapist: It's understandable that this experience seems to support the thought, as it was a positive outcome that was directly linked to your extra effort. However, I want to point out that working harder isn't always necessary or the sole factor in determining success. As we've seen earlier, your team also achieved a successful outcome on the day you took a break for salsa. Let's try to balance these perspectives. While hard work can contribute to success, it's also essential to recognize that your competence and value are not solely dependent on your hours or intensity.

Patient: I see what you're saying. It's like there's a balance between working hard and trusting my team to handle things when I need to step back. It's just hard to let go sometimes, especially when I'm used to being in control.

Therapist: You're right, it can be challenging to find that balance, particularly when you're used to a certain way of operating. It takes practice and self-reflection to shift these patterns. I'm glad we've been able to explore this further, and I think it opens up new possibilities for how you can approach your work and self-care going forward.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the support and the different perspective. It's definitely something I'll keep in mind as I move forward.

Therapist: You're welcome, Emilio. Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to take small steps. Let's continue to work on this together. For today's homework, I'd like you to keep a log of situations where you can practice finding that balance between working hard and allowing yourself to set boundaries. Pay attention to how it impacts your thoughts, feelings, and overall well-being. We'll review it together in our next session and discuss how it relates to your goals.

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I'll start keeping a log and see how it goes. Looking forward to our next session.
