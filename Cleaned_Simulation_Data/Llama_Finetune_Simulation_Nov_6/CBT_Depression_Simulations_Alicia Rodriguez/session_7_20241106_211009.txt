Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again. Before we begin, I want to remind you that while I'm here to support you, I do have some limitations as an AI therapist. I can't access real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. And since our communication is text-based, I can't interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm committed to doing my best to help you through this process. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi, Nova. I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your honesty. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the "Deepening the Positive" technique, but it's been tough. I keep getting pulled back into overworking and feeling like I'm not doing enough. I did manage to set some boundaries, like leaving work at a reasonable hour a couple of times, but it's still a struggle. How do I keep these positive changes going?

Therapist: It's great that you've been trying to implement the techniques we've discussed, even if it's been challenging. Setting boundaries can be a difficult process, and it often takes repeated effort to maintain them over time. I want to commend you for taking these steps, even if they're small. Let's dive deeper into your experience with the "Deepening the Positive" technique and setting boundaries. What thoughts or feelings come up when you try to maintain these changes?

Patient: When I try to maintain these changes, I often feel guilty and anxious. I worry that if I don't work late, I'll fall behind or that my team will think I'm not committed. I also feel like I'm letting my parents down, even though they're not here to see it. It's like I'm programmed to always push myself harder, and any deviation feels wrong. How do I reprogram these thoughts?

Therapist: It's common for people to feel anxious or guilty when starting to set boundaries, especially when it involves changing long-standing patterns of behavior. These feelings often stem from underlying beliefs about work, success, and what it means to be a good employee or child. Let's explore these beliefs further. Can you identify any specific thoughts that come up when you're trying to set boundaries or maintain positive changes?

Patient: Sure, one specific thought that comes up is, "If I don't work late, I'm not dedicated enough." Another one is, "My team will think I'm lazy if I leave on time." And then there's, "My parents would be disappointed if they knew I wasn't working every possible hour." These thoughts make it really hard to stick to boundaries. How do I challenge these thoughts?

Therapist: You've identified some powerful thoughts that may be contributing to your struggles with setting boundaries. Let's start by examining these thoughts using the Evidence-Based Thinking technique we've discussed before. For each thought, can you identify evidence that supports or challenges it?

Patient: Okay, for the thought "If I don't work late, I'm not dedicated enough," the evidence that supports it is that I've always worked long hours and it's been expected in my field. The evidence that challenges it is that I've seen other team members leave on time and still be highly productive and respected. For "My team will think I'm lazy if I leave on time," the evidence that supports it is that I've heard some colleagues joke about people who leave early. The evidence that challenges it is that my manager has praised me for my work quality, not just the hours I put in. And for "My parents would be disappointed if they knew I wasn't working every possible hour," the evidence that supports it is that they always emphasized hard work. The evidence that challenges it is that they also wanted me to be happy and healthy, which might mean balancing work and life. Does that make sense?

Therapist: That's a great analysis, Alicia. You've identified some strong evidence that challenges these thoughts, even though it may be difficult to accept initially. Recognizing the disconnect between these thoughts and the evidence can help you develop more balanced and compassionate beliefs about yourself, your colleagues, and your family's expectations.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's still hard to fully accept these challenges, but I see how they make sense. I guess the next step is to keep reminding myself of this evidence when those negative thoughts come up. How do I make that part easier?

Therapist: One strategy is to create a positive data log. This is a place where you can record evidence that supports new, more balanced beliefs. For example, you could write down instances of positive feedback, moments when you accomplished tasks efficiently, or times when your team members appreciated your boundary-setting. By actively looking for and recording this evidence, you can start to shift your focus away from the negative thoughts and build a more realistic and supportive view of yourself.

Patient: That sounds like a practical approach. I can start by keeping a small notebook or using an app to log these positive instances. It might help me see the bigger picture and feel more confident in setting boundaries. I'll give it a try and see how it goes. Thanks, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad this strategy resonates with you. Remember, challenging long-held beliefs and patterns takes practice and patience. Be kind and compassionate with yourself throughout this process. In our next session, we can review your progress and discuss any obstacles that arise. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate that. I'll keep working on it and look forward to our next session.

Therapist: Before we end today's session, let's check in on your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.

###.

Patient: Sure, Nova. My mood is still a bit heavy, but I feel a little lighter after discussing these thoughts and strategies. I'm hopeful that keeping a positive data log will help me see things more clearly. I also want to mention that I've been feeling a bit more connected to my cultural roots lately, especially after joining a salsa class again. It's been a small but meaningful step.
