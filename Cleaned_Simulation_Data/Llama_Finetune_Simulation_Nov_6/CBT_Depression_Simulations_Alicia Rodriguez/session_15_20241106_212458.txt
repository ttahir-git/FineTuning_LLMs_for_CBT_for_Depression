Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again for our 15th session. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I lack the ability to directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to the self-care activities, like salsa dancing and walks, but it's been tough. Work has been really demanding, and I find myself slipping back into old habits of staying late and overworking. I did manage to set some boundaries, though. I left work on time twice last week, which felt really strange at first.

Therapist: It's great that you were able to set some boundaries despite the challenges you've faced. Changing long-standing patterns takes time and effort. I'm curious to know more about your experience when you left work on time. What thoughts and emotions came up for you during and after those instances?

Patient: When I left work on time, I felt a mix of emotions. At first, there was a lot of anxiety. I kept thinking, "What if something goes wrong while I'm not there?" or "What if my team needs me?" After I left, I felt a strange sense of guilt, like I was letting everyone down. But when I got home and had some time to relax, I also felt a bit of relief. It was nice to have some time to myself, even if it was just for a little while.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alicia. It's common to experience a range of emotions when we start setting boundaries, especially if we've been working in an unhealthy way for a long time. The relief you felt after leaving work is a great sign that your boundaries are aligning with your needs and values. I'm also glad to hear that you were able to challenge some of those anxiety-provoking thoughts. Let's take a moment to look at the evidence that supports your new core belief: "I am competent and valuable, and I can still be successful while taking care of myself." Can you share an example of how this new belief helped you in the past week?

Patient: Sure, I can think of one example. Last week, I left work on time to attend a salsa class. Normally, I would have skipped it to stay at the office. During the class, I felt more relaxed and connected to myself, which I hadn't felt in a while. The next day at work, I noticed that I was more focused and productive. It was like taking that break actually helped me recharge and perform better. So, I guess that's evidence that taking care of myself doesn't diminish my competence or value at work.

Therapist: That's a great example, Alicia! It's so powerful when we can see the positive impact of our actions on both our personal well-being and our professional performance. This is strong evidence that supports your new core belief. I'm really proud of the progress you've been making in challenging your old patterns and embracing healthier ones. Now, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. We can review your homework, discuss any challenges that came up over the past week, and explore some strategies for managing anxiety and guilt as you continue setting boundaries at work. What would you like to prioritize today?

Patient: Thank you for acknowledging the progress, Nova. I think prioritizing challenges that came up over the past week would be helpful. Specifically, I've been struggling with anxiety and guilt when setting boundaries, especially during high-pressure situations at work. I'd also like to explore strategies for managing those feelings so I can continue to practice self-care without feeling like I'm failing or letting others down.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan, Alicia. Let's start by discussing the challenges you faced with anxiety and guilt when setting boundaries at work. Can you walk me through a specific situation where you experienced these feelings?

Patient: Sure, there was one situation last week that really stood out. We had a critical project deadline, and I knew I needed to leave on time to attend a salsa class. As the clock ticked closer to my departure time, I started feeling this intense anxiety. I kept thinking, "What if something goes wrong and they need me?" or "What if they think I'm not committed?" I ended up leaving, but the guilt lingered for the rest of the evening. It was hard to enjoy the class because I was constantly checking my phone, worried about work.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Alicia. It's a great opportunity for us to explore how you can manage anxiety and guilt in those high-pressure situations. One technique that can be helpful is called "thought challenging." It involves identifying the anxious or guilty thoughts, examining the evidence for and against those thoughts, and then generating alternative perspectives. Let's try applying this technique to the situation you just described.

Can you identify the most prominent anxious or guilty thought you had during that situation at work?

Patient: The most prominent thought was definitely, "What if something goes wrong and they need me?" It was like a constant loop in my mind, making it hard to focus on anything else.

Therapist: Okay, let's start by examining the evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that something might go wrong and your team might need you?

Patient: Well, we've had some issues with the project before, so there's a history of things not going perfectly. Also, I'm the team lead, so my team might expect me to be available at all times. But on the other hand, my team is experienced and capable. They've handled issues on their own before, and I've made sure to delegate tasks effectively.

Therapist: That's great that you're able to recognize the strengths and capabilities of your team, even in the face of past challenges. Let's look at the evidence against the thought that something might go wrong. What would you say to a friend or colleague who expressed the same concern?

Patient: If a friend told me they were worried about leaving work because they thought something might go wrong, I'd probably remind them that their team is skilled and that they've prepared well. I'd also emphasize the importance of self-care and how taking breaks can actually improve productivity and problem-solving in the long run.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Alicia. It's often easier to give compassionate advice to others than to ourselves. What do you think about applying that same logic to your own situation?

Alicia: It makes sense. I guess the thought that something might go wrong is based more on fear and assumption than on reality. When I really think about it, there's no hard evidence that something would actually happen if I left on time.

Patient: Exactly, Alicia. By challenging the anxious thought and considering the evidence, you can see that it's more about fear and assumption than reality. This can help reduce the anxiety and guilt you feel when setting boundaries. How do you feel about trying this technique the next time you face a similar situation?

Therapist: Let's continue applying this technique to the anxious thought you mentioned. You stated earlier that "What if something goes wrong and they need me?" Now, let's explore this thought further. What do you think might happen if you were to respond to this thought with "I can't predict what might happen, but I know my team is capable of handling challenges on their own"?
Alicia: I guess if I responded with that thought, I wouldn't feel as anxious. It's like I'm not giving myself permission to worry so much, but instead, I'm trusting in my team and our process.

Patient: That's a very positive shift in perspective, Alicia. By trusting in your team and the process, you're reducing the anxiety and guilt associated with leaving on time. This can help you enjoy your salsa class more fully and return to work refreshed and ready to tackle any challenges. How do you feel about incorporating this new thought into your mindset moving forward?

Therapist: I feel a lot better about setting boundaries now. It's helpful to know that I can challenge those anxious thoughts and find evidence to support my new core belief.

Patient: That's wonderful to hear, Alicia. It's a significant step forward in managing your anxiety and improving your overall well-being. Remember, it's okay to practice this technique and sometimes still feel anxious; the goal is progress, not perfection. How do you plan to remind yourself of this new thought when you face similar situations in the future?

Therapist: You can write the thought down on a card and keep it with you, or you can set a reminder on your phone to help you remember to challenge the anxious thoughts. It's also helpful to practice this technique when you're not in a stressful situation, so it becomes easier to apply when you do face challenges.

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I think I'll write the thought down on a card and keep it in my wallet. It'll be a quick reminder whenever I start feeling anxious about leaving work. And I'll try to practice this technique more often when I'm not under pressure, so it becomes more natural.

Therapist: That's a great idea, Alicia. Remembering to practice and apply these techniques regularly can lead to greater success in managing your anxiety and setting boundaries. I'm proud of the progress you've made and your commitment to improving your well-being.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance. It's been really helpful to have someone to talk to about these issues. I'm looking forward to continuing our sessions and seeing more progress.

Therapist: I'm looking forward to our future sessions as well, Alicia. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there may be ups and downs along the way. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you continue this journey of growth and self-care.

Before we wrap up, let's discuss your homework for this week. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought challenging technique we've discussed, using the new thought we identified: "I can't predict what might happen, but I know my team is capable of handling challenges on their own." Write this down on a card and keep it with you, set a reminder on your phone, or practice this technique when you're not under pressure. Also, continue setting boundaries at work by leaving on time whenever possible and communicating your needs assertively when you need to stay late or come in early for a specific reason. What thoughts or questions do you have about your homework?

Patient: I think the homework sounds manageable. I'll definitely keep the card with me and set reminders on my phone. The only concern I have is that sometimes, my team might really need me, and I don't want to be seen as unsupportive. How can I balance setting boundaries with being a good team leader?

Therapist: That's a valid concern, Alicia. One way to balance setting boundaries with being a good team leader is to communicate your needs and limitations effectively. When you do need to stay late or come in early, let your team know why and what you need from them in advance. It's important to be clear and upfront about your needs so your team can plan accordingly. You can also let your team know that you're committed to their success and that setting boundaries is a way to ensure that you're able to fulfill your role effectively.

Remember, setting boundaries is a skill that takes practice. It's okay if it feels uncomfortable at first. With time and repetition, it will become easier and more natural. How do you feel about incorporating these strategies into your homework this week?

Patient: I feel more confident about it now. I'll make sure to communicate my needs clearly and let my team know that setting boundaries is for the benefit of everyone. I'll also keep practicing the thought challenging technique to help manage my anxiety. Thanks for the advice, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad we discussed this and that you're feeling more confident about setting boundaries. Remember to be patient with yourself and celebrate the progress you've made. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Before we wrap up, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now, and do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?

Patient: I'm feeling a bit more at ease now, knowing that I have a plan to manage my anxiety and set boundaries. I'm also looking forward to continuing our sessions and seeing more progress. Thanks again for your support, Nova.
