Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again for our 8th CBT session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our previous meeting. I want to acknowledge that while I strive to provide the best support possible, I do have limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm fully committed to working with you and supporting your journey towards better mental health. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to the structured breaks and self-care activities we talked about. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days, I feel like I'm making real progress—like when I take a walk and come back feeling refreshed and more focused. But other days, especially when I have a lot of deadlines, I still struggle with that guilt about taking breaks. I end up working through them, which leaves me feeling drained and less productive in the long run. I guess I'm still figuring out how to balance everything.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you've been implementing the structured breaks and self-care activities we discussed. It's completely normal to have ups and downs in this process. I'm glad you're recognizing the benefits of taking walks and coming back with more focus. At the same time, I understand that the guilt around breaks can be challenging to overcome. We can definitely explore that further today. Before we dive in, can you share a bit more about how your mood has been overall since our last session?

Patient: Overall, my mood has been a bit mixed. There are moments when I feel really good—like when I finish a paper or when I connect with my friends in the LGBTQ+ support group. But there are also times when I feel really down, especially when I think about how my parents still struggle to accept my identity. It's like a constant tug-of-war between feeling proud of who I am and feeling guilty for disappointing them. And then there's the academic pressure, which never really goes away. So, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster, but I'm trying to stay positive and keep moving forward.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Naomi. It's clear that you're dealing with a lot of different stressors, from your family situation to your academic pressures. It's encouraging to hear that you have moments of pride and connection with your support group. That's a vital source of strength for you. We can definitely explore the mixed emotions and the tug-of-war you mentioned. It seems like there are a lot of thoughts and feelings around your identity, your parents' expectations, and your academic performance. What would you like to prioritize in our session today?

Patient: I think I'd like to focus on the guilt I feel around taking breaks, especially when I have a lot of academic work to do. It's something that keeps coming up, and I feel like if I can get a better handle on that, it might help with my overall stress and mood. I know we've talked about it before, but I'm still struggling with it. Maybe we can go over some specific examples or strategies to help me feel less guilty when I take a break?

Therapist: Absolutely, Naomi. Let's dive into the guilt around taking breaks during your academic work. It seems like this is a recurring challenge, and addressing it could have a positive impact on your overall stress and mood. Before we do that, I want to acknowledge that this is an important topic for you, and it takes courage to keep coming back to it even though it's challenging. Let's set an agenda for today's session. We can start by reviewing a few specific examples of when you felt guilty for taking breaks, then explore strategies to help you feel less guilty in those moments. We can also discuss how to communicate your needs to others, like your family, regarding your mental health and self-care. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I think starting with specific examples will help me see things more clearly. And talking about how to communicate my needs to my family could be really helpful too. I've been avoiding that conversation because I'm afraid of their reaction, but maybe it's time to face it. Let's start with the examples of when I felt guilty for taking breaks. One recent example was last week when I had a big research paper due. I took a 20-minute break to go for a walk, and while I felt better afterward, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was wasting time. I kept thinking about how much more I could have accomplished if I had just kept working.

Therapist: That's a great example, Naomi. Let's break down what happened there and see if we can identify the thoughts and emotions that contributed to your guilt. When you took the 20-minute break to go for a walk, what thoughts went through your mind about taking time away from work?

Patient: Well, the main thought that kept popping up was, "I should be working right now. This break is just wasting time." I also felt a bit anxious, like I was falling behind on my work. And then there was this underlying guilt, like I was being lazy or irresponsible for taking a break when I had so much to do. It's like my mind was constantly reminding me of all the things I needed to get done, and the break felt like a distraction from that.

Therapist: You've done a great job identifying those thoughts and emotions. It's interesting how the thought "I should be working right now" keeps coming up. That could be a central theme for us to explore. For now, let's look at that thought and see if we can evaluate the evidence for and against it. What would you say to a friend who expressed a similar thought? Would you agree with them or challenge the idea that they should be working during a scheduled break?

Patient: If a friend told me they felt guilty for taking a break, I'd probably tell them that it's important to take care of themselves and that breaks are actually beneficial for productivity. I'd remind them that taking breaks can help clear their mind and make them more focused when they return to work. So, if I were talking to a friend, I wouldn't agree with the idea that they should be working during a scheduled break. I'd challenge that thought and encourage them to see the value in self-care. But when it comes to myself, I find it harder to be that kind of supportive friend.

Therapist: That's a valuable insight, Naomi. It's common for people to have a different perspective on themselves than they do on their friends. The fact that you can recognize the value of breaks for productivity is a positive step. Let's try to apply that same logic to your own situation. What evidence do you have that taking that 20-minute break actually helped you be more productive later?

Patient: Well, after the walk, I did feel more refreshed and focused. I was able to get back to my research paper and finish it more efficiently than if I had just kept working without a break. I also noticed that my mind was clearer, and I was able to think more creatively about the topic. So, the evidence is that the break did help me be more productive in the long run. It's just hard to see that in the moment when I'm feeling the pressure to get everything done.

Therapist: That's a great example of how taking breaks can actually improve overall productivity, even if it feels counterintuitive in the moment. As we've discussed before, our thoughts and feelings can sometimes lead us to see things in a distorted way. This is especially true when we're dealing with intense emotions like anxiety or guilt. Let's try to reframe the thought, "I should be working right now. This break is just wasting time." What's an alternative, more balanced thought you could have instead?

Patient: Hmm, maybe something like, "Taking a break now will help me be more productive later. It's important to take care of my mental and physical well-being to perform my best." That feels a bit more balanced and acknowledges the value of the break without the guilt. It's still a work in progress, but it's a step in the right direction.

Therapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought, Naomi. It's more balanced and acknowledges the benefits of the break. The goal is to find a perspective that feels more helpful and less distorted. As you practice this thought challenging, it will become easier to see breaks in a more positive light. How can you remind yourself of this alternative thought when you start to feel guilty about taking breaks?

Patient: I think I can remind myself by writing it down and keeping it somewhere visible, like on a sticky note on my desk. That way, when I start to feel guilty about taking a break, I can look at it and remember that it's okay and even beneficial to step away for a bit. I can also try to incorporate more breaks into my routine so it becomes a normal part of my workflow, not something I feel guilty about.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Naomi. Writing down the alternative thought and keeping it visible can be a powerful way to remind yourself of this new perspective. Incorporating breaks into your routine is also a good way to make it feel more normal and less like an added stressor. As you continue practicing this thought challenging, you'll likely find it easier to prioritize your well-being and see the benefits of breaks. How can you apply this same process of evaluating evidence and reframing thoughts to other situations where you feel guilty or stressed about taking breaks?

Patient: I can apply this process to other situations by first identifying the negative thoughts that come up, like "I'm wasting time" or "I should be doing something more productive." Then, I can challenge those thoughts by looking at the evidence that taking a break actually helps me in the long run. For example, if I'm feeling stressed about taking a break during a group project, I can remind myself that a short break can help me collaborate more effectively when I return. It's about shifting my mindset to see breaks as a necessary part of my workflow, not something to feel guilty about.

Therapist: That's a great way to apply this process, Naomi. It's about recognizing the specific negative thoughts that arise and challenging them with evidence and alternative perspectives. By consistently practicing this thought challenging, it will become easier to prioritize your well-being and see the benefits of breaks in various situations. Let's explore this concept further by discussing how you can apply it to your family's expectations and the pressure you feel regarding your academic performance. How do you think your family's expectations might be impacting your feelings around taking breaks?

Patient: I think my family's expectations definitely play a role in how I feel about taking breaks. They've always emphasized the importance of hard work and dedication, so when I take a break, I often feel like I'm not living up to those expectations. It's like I'm letting them down by not pushing myself to the limit all the time. But I also know that their intentions are good, and they just want the best for me. It's a tricky balance to find, especially when I'm trying to honor their values while also taking care of myself.

Therapist: That's a challenging balance to find, Naomi. It's common for family expectations to have a significant impact on how we perceive our own behavior. It sounds like there's an internal conflict between your own needs for rest and self-care, and the expectations you feel from your family. Let's explore this further by using the downward arrow technique. This involves asking yourself, "If that were true, what would that mean?" repeatedly until you reach the core belief underlying your thoughts and emotions. Let's start with the thought, "When I take a break, I'm letting my family down." If that were true, what would it mean to you?

Patient: If that were true, it would mean that I'm not living up to the high standards they've set for me. It would mean that I'm not as dedicated or hardworking as they believe I should be. And that would make me feel like I'm failing them, which is something I really don't want to do. It's like I'm betraying their trust and the values they've instilled in me.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. Let's continue with this line of questioning. If you were to feel like you were failing your family by taking breaks, what would that mean about you as a person?

Patient: If I felt like I were failing my family by taking breaks, it would mean that I'm not the strong, capable person they believe me to be. It would mean that I'm not living up to my full potential, and that I'm not as resilient or determined as they think I am. It would make me feel like I'm letting them down in a way that goes beyond just not meeting their expectations—it would make me feel like I'm not worthy of their love and support.

Therapist: That's a significant revelation, Naomi. It seems like the underlying core belief here might be something like, "If I don't meet my family's expectations perfectly all the time, it means that I'm not worthy of their love and support." This belief could be fueling the guilt you feel around taking breaks. Let's explore this core belief further and see if we can find evidence for and against it. What do you think about the idea that you would need to meet every expectation perfectly to be worthy of your family's love and support?

Patient: I think that's a really tough belief to grapple with. On one hand, I know that my family loves me unconditionally, and they've shown that in many ways, even when I haven't met their expectations. On the other hand, I do feel like they have high standards, and it's hard not to internalize that pressure. I guess the evidence against the belief is that they've been there for me through thick and thin, even when I've made mistakes or taken breaks. But the evidence for it is that I still feel guilty when I don't meet those high standards, like I'm not living up to the person they want me to be.

Therapist: That's a great point, Naomi. It's common for beliefs to be partially true, but there are always nuances and gray areas. In this case, it seems like there's evidence on both sides of the belief, even though the "for" evidence feels stronger in the moment. Let's try to reframe this core belief in a way that acknowledges your family's love and support, but also your own right to self-care and well-being. What's a more balanced belief that feels right for you?

Patient: A more balanced belief might be that my family loves and supports me unconditionally, and while they have high expectations, they also want me to take care of myself. It's okay to take breaks and prioritize my well-being, because that's what allows me to be the best version of myself in the long run. They want me to succeed, but they also want me to be happy and healthy.

Therapist: That's a wonderful reframe, Naomi. It acknowledges the love and support from your family, but also your own right to self-care and well-being. This balanced belief can be a helpful compass when you're facing the guilt around taking breaks or feeling pressure from expectations. As you continue to practice thought challenging, remember to look for evidence that supports this new belief. Let's also discuss how you can communicate this belief to your family in a way that feels authentic and respectful. How might you bring up the topic of your needs for breaks and self-care with your family?

Patient: I think it would be important to approach the topic with honesty and openness. I could start by thanking them for their support and high expectations, and then explain that while I appreciate their encouragement, I also need to take breaks to stay healthy and focused. I could share some of the reframe we discussed, like how taking care of myself allows me to be the best version of myself and ultimately meet their expectations in a sustainable way. I might also mention that I'm learning to balance their values with my own needs, and that I hope they can understand and support me in that journey.

Therapist: That's a great approach, Naomi. Starting with gratitude and acknowledging your family's values is a respectful way to express your own needs. Sharing your new understanding and beliefs can help them see where you're coming from and why taking breaks is important to you. It's okay if they need time to process or adjust to this shift in perspective. Remember that it's not about changing your family's values, but rather finding a balance between honoring those values and respecting your own well-being. As we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in challenging your thoughts around breaks and in recognizing the value of self-care. These insights will help you continue building the skills to manage your depression and work towards your goals. For homework, I'd like you to continue practicing the thought challenging we've discussed, especially in situations where you feel guilty about taking breaks. I also encourage you to practice communicating your needs to your family, starting with this new perspective we've discussed. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have ups and downs in this process. What's most important is that you continue to show up for yourself with kindness and compassion, and that you reach out for support when you need it. Do you have any final thoughts or questions before we end today's session?

Patient: I think the biggest thing for me is just remembering that it's okay to take breaks and that it doesn't mean I'm failing or letting anyone down. I'll definitely keep practicing thought challenging and try to communicate my needs to my family. I appreciate all the support and guidance you've given me so far, and I'm looking forward to continuing this journey. Thanks, Nova.
