Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again for our third CBT session. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been practicing the grounding techniques and PMR, which have helped a bit. However, I've been struggling more with academic deadlines and feeling overwhelmed. I had a presentation last week that I was really anxious about, but I managed to break it down into smaller tasks, which helped. Still, I felt really drained afterward and had a hard time focusing on other work. How can we build on what we've been doing to help with this?

Therapist: It's great to hear that you've been practicing the techniques we discussed, even though it's been challenging. Breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps is a crucial skill in managing overwhelm. Let's explore the presentation experience further. What thoughts and emotions came up for you during and after the presentation?

Patient: During the presentation, I felt really anxious and kept worrying about whether people were judging me or if I was making mistakes. Afterward, I felt a mix of relief and exhaustion. I was glad it was over, but I also felt like I could have done better. I noticed that I had a lot of negative thoughts about my performance, like "I sounded stupid" or "They probably think I'm not knowledgeable."

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It's common to experience a mix of emotions after a presentation, especially when it brings up self-doubt. Let's look at the thoughts you mentioned, like "I sounded stupid" and "They probably think I'm not knowledgeable." Can you identify any cognitive distortions in those thoughts?

Patient: Hmm, cognitive distortions? I'm not sure what those are exactly. Could you explain what you mean by that?

Therapist: Of course, cognitive distortions are essentially biased or irrational ways of thinking. Some common ones include all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, and mind reading. All-or-nothing thinking is when we see things in extreme, black-and-white terms, like "I sounded stupid" â€“ there's no middle ground. Overgeneralization is when we take one negative experience and apply it to all future situations, like thinking that everyone thinks you're not knowledgeable. Mind reading is when we assume we know what others are thinking, such as "They probably think I'm not knowledgeable." Does this help clarify the concept?

Patient: Yes, that makes sense. So, in my case, I think I was using all-or-nothing thinking and mind reading. I was seeing my performance as either perfect or a complete failure, and I was assuming I knew what others were thinking without any real evidence. How can I start to challenge these thoughts?

Therapist: Great insight, Naomi! Challenging cognitive distortions involves examining the evidence for and against the thought and considering alternative perspectives. For example, when you think, "I sounded stupid," you could ask yourself, "What evidence do I have that supports this thought? Is it based on facts or assumptions?" You might realize that others were engaged and attentive during your presentation, which is evidence against the thought that you sounded stupid. Then, consider an alternative perspective: "Is it possible that I did well, even if I wasn't perfect?" How does that feel to practice?

Patient: That makes sense. I can see how looking at the evidence could help. I do remember some people asking questions and seeming interested, which is a good sign. I guess I can try to remind myself that it's okay to not be perfect and that people are there to learn, not judge. It feels a bit more balanced to think that way. How can I keep practicing this in other situations?

Therapist: That's a great goal, Naomi. One way to practice is to use a thought record, which is a tool for tracking and challenging negative thoughts. We'll work on this together in session, and you can also use it on your own when you notice distressing thoughts. The idea is to write down the situation, the emotions, and the negative thoughts, then look for evidence and alternative perspectives as we discussed. Over time, this will help you build the skill of challenging distortions and developing more balanced thinking. We can also continue practicing the relaxation techniques and grounding exercises we've already discussed. How does that sound for our plan today?

Patient: That sounds really helpful. I'm ready to start working on the thought record and practicing more balanced thinking. Let's dive into it.

Therapist: Let's start by reviewing the homework from our last session. You were practicing the Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) technique for 5 minutes daily, using the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique when feeling overwhelmed, and practicing the 6-6-6 grounding exercise once a day. How did those exercises feel for you, and did you notice any changes in your stress levels or overall well-being?

Patient: I did the PMR and grounding exercises as you suggested. The PMR was really helpful in calming me down before bed, and I noticed I slept better. The grounding techniques were useful during the day when I felt overwhelmed, especially the 5-4-3-2-1 method. It helped me focus and feel more present. I didn't do the 6-6-6 exercise as often, but I think it could be useful too. Overall, I felt a bit more in control and less anxious.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you found the relaxation techniques helpful, especially with improving your sleep. Noticing these changes is an important part of the process. Let's discuss your experience with the thought records you started. Were you able to identify any cognitive distortions in your thoughts, like the ones we discussed earlier?

Patient: Yes, I started keeping a thought record. I noticed that I often use all-or-nothing thinking, especially when it comes to my academic performance. For example, if I don't understand something right away, I think I'm completely incompetent. I also realized I do a lot of mind reading, like assuming my professors think I'm not smart just because I asked a question in class. It's been eye-opening to see these patterns.

Therapist: That's an excellent observation, Naomi. Recognizing these cognitive distortions is a crucial step in the therapeutic process. Now, let's explore how we can challenge these thoughts using evidence and alternative perspectives. Let's take the example of thinking you're incompetent if you don't understand something right away. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?

Patient: Well, I guess the evidence is that I feel frustrated and anxious when I don't get something immediately. I also might compare myself to others who seem to understand faster, which makes me feel worse. But that's more of a feeling than actual evidence, right?

Therapist: Exactly, Naomi. It's essential to separate feelings from facts. Frustration and anxiety can be valid emotions, but they don't necessarily reflect reality. Let's look at the evidence against this thought. Have there been times when you've struggled initially, but with persistence, you were able to understand the material?

Patient: Yes, definitely. There have been times when I felt completely lost at first, but after spending more time on it or asking for help, I eventually understood. For example, in my last research project, I struggled with the data analysis part, but after consulting with my advisor and doing extra reading, I got it. So, I guess it's not true that I'm completely incompetent just because I don't get it right away.

Therapist: That's a great example of how you've successfully navigated challenging situations in the past. This evidence challenges the all-or-nothing thinking and shows that your competence is not a fixed trait but something that develops over time with effort and support. Now, let's consider an alternative perspective. Is it possible that it's okay to not understand something right away and that with time and effort, you can grasp the concept?

Patient: Yes, I think that's a more balanced perspective. It's okay to struggle and ask for help. I guess I need to remind myself that understanding takes time and that it's normal to need more effort in some areas.

Therapist: Absolutely, Naomi. Developing a growth mindset is crucial in managing self-critical thoughts. A growth mindset acknowledges that everyone faces challenges and that these experiences are opportunities for growth rather than signs of failure. Remembering this alternative perspective can help you be kinder to yourself and recognize your progress even in the face of difficulties. How do you feel about applying this approach to other situations where you notice cognitive distortions?

Patient: I think applying this approach could really help, especially with the academic pressures I've been facing. It's hard to remember when I'm in the thick of it, but I do see how past experiences show that I can overcome challenges. I want to try this with my relationship with my parents too. Their struggles with my identity sometimes make me feel like I'm a failure in their eyes, but maybe approaching it with a growth mindset could help me see their reactions as something they're working through too, not just me.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Naomi. Applying this mindset to your relationship with your parents is a significant step forward. Recognizing that their reactions are influenced by factors beyond your control and that you can support them through those challenges, rather than seeing yourself as a failure. This shift in perspective can help create a more compassionate and understanding relationship. Let's continue to explore this further and develop strategies to support these changes.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your guidance. I'm looking forward to exploring more strategies and seeing how they can help me in different areas of my life.

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi. I'm here to support you as we continue this journey together. Remember that progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks along the way. The important thing is to keep practicing these skills and reaching out for support when needed. Speaking of which, let's discuss how we can build on these techniques and add some additional tools to your toolkit. What thoughts or concerns do you have about continuing to manage your stress and emotions in the coming week?

Patient: I think one of my main concerns is staying consistent with these techniques when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Sometimes, when I'm stressed, I revert back to old habits like self-harm. I want to find ways to remind myself to use these new strategies, especially during those tough moments. Do you have any suggestions on how to stay consistent?

Therapist: That's a great question, Naomi. Consistency can be challenging, especially when you're dealing with difficult emotions or situations. One way to stay consistent is to create a personalized "coping kit" with reminders and cues that prompt you to use these techniques. For example, you could write down the relaxation exercises or grounding techniques on index cards and keep them in your wallet or pocket. You could also set reminders on your phone or create visual cues like sticky notes on your computer or bathroom mirror. The goal is to make these techniques easily accessible and remind yourself to use them when you need them.

Patient: That sounds really helpful, Nova. I like the idea of having a coping kit with reminders. I think I'll start by making some index cards with different techniques and keeping them in places where I'm likely to see them, like my desk and my backpack. I'll also set some reminders on my phone for when I know I'll be stressed, like before a big class or a meeting with my advisor. Thanks for the suggestion!

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi. I'm glad that idea resonates with you. Remember, creating a coping kit is a personal process, and it's okay to experiment with different strategies to see what works best for you. As you start using these reminders and cues, you'll likely find that it becomes easier to access these techniques when you need them most.

Patient: Yes, I think that's a good point. It might take some time to figure out what works best for me, but I'm willing to try different things and see how they go. I'll keep you updated on how it goes with the coping kit and any other strategies I try.

Therapist: That sounds great, Naomi. I'm here to support you throughout this process. As we continue working together, we'll explore additional strategies and techniques to help you manage your emotions and stress more effectively. Remember, therapy is a collaborative effort, and your input and feedback are essential in creating a tailored treatment plan that works best for you.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance. I'm looking forward to continuing our work together and finding more ways to improve my mental health and well-being.

Therapist: You've made some great insights today, Naomi. As we wrap up our session, I want to introduce the idea of homework assignments. Homework is an important part of CBT because it helps you practice and apply the skills we discuss in therapy to your daily life. Assigning homework gives you the opportunity to continue making progress even between sessions. How do you feel about incorporating homework into our work together?

Patient: I think homework sounds like a good idea, Nova. It will give me a chance to practice these techniques more regularly and see what works best for me. I'm willing to give it a try and see how it goes. What kind of homework do you usually assign?

Therapist: Homework assignments can vary depending on your goals and the skills we work on in therapy. Some examples include practicing relaxation techniques, completing thought records, or engaging in behavioral experiments. For this week, I'd like to assign two homework tasks related to the coping kit we discussed earlier. First, I'd like you to create an index card for each relaxation technique we've covered, including PMR, 5-4-3-2-1, and 6-6-6, and write down a few key points about each technique. Then, I'd like you to keep these index cards in places where you're likely to see them regularly, such as on your desk, in your backpack, or near your phone. The goal is to have these reminders easily accessible when you need them. Second, I'd like you to set reminders on your phone for specific times of the day when you'll check in with yourself and practice a relaxation technique. For example, you might set a reminder before a big class or a meeting with your advisor. This will help you stay consistent with your practice. How does that sound for homework this week?

Patient: That sounds manageable and practical, Nova. I'll start by making the index cards for each relaxation technique and placing them in the suggested spots. I'll also set up reminders on my phone to check in with myself and practice a relaxation technique before important events. I'm looking forward to seeing how this helps me stay consistent with these strategies.

Therapist: Great, Naomi. I'm excited to hear how this homework goes for you. Remember, the goal is to practice and apply these skills regularly, so don't worry if it feels challenging at first. We'll discuss your experiences with the homework at our next session and make any necessary adjustments to help you get the most out of this process.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I'm ready to give it my best effort and see how it goes. I'll make sure to keep track of my experiences and any challenges I face so we can discuss them next time. I'm looking forward to our next session and seeing the progress I can make with these strategies.

Therapist: As we wrap up our session today, I want to review the main points we discussed and the homework assignments for the coming week. We started by exploring the presentation anxiety you experienced, and how breaking down the process into smaller tasks helped manage the overwhelm. We then identified cognitive distortions in your thoughts, such as all-or-nothing thinking and mind reading, and practiced challenging these distortions by examining the evidence and considering alternative perspectives. Finally, we discussed the importance of creating a coping kit with reminders and cues to help you stay consistent with relaxation techniques and thought records. For homework, you'll be creating index cards with relaxation techniques and placing them in accessible spots, and setting reminders on your phone to practice a relaxation technique during specific times each day. How are you feeling about the progress we've made today, and how are you feeling about the homework assignments?

Patient: I feel good about the progress we've made today, Nova. It was helpful to identify those cognitive distortions and practice challenging them. I think the homework assignments are practical and will help me stay consistent with these strategies. I'm a bit nervous about the presentation anxiety, but I'm hopeful that breaking it down into smaller tasks and using the coping kit will make it more manageable. I'm ready to give it a try and see how it goes.
