Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again for our 18th session. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. It's good to know where you stand. I've been okay, I guess. The academic workload has been pretty intense, and I've had a few rough moments with my parents. They still don't seem to understand my identity, and it's been tough. On the brighter side, the support group has been really helpful. I've been trying to practice those thought-challenging techniques, but it feels a bit awkward sometimes. How do you suggest I handle that?

Therapist: It's great that you've been attending the support group and making an effort to practice the thought-challenging techniques. It's normal to feel a bit awkward at first, as you're learning a new skill. I suggest that you stick with it, even if it feels uncomfortable initially. With time and practice, it will become more natural. When you notice yourself feeling awkward, try to remember why you're challenging your thoughts – it's to develop a more balanced perspective and reduce distress. How does that sound to you?

Patient: That makes sense. I guess it's like learning any new skill, it takes time to get comfortable with it. I'll keep at it, even when it feels awkward. I've also been trying to break down my academic tasks into smaller steps, like you suggested last time. It's helped a bit, but I still find myself getting overwhelmed sometimes. Any tips on how to manage that better?

Therapist: That's wonderful that you've been breaking down tasks into smaller steps. It's a great way to manage overwhelming feelings. Another helpful strategy is to prioritize your tasks based on urgency and importance. This can help you focus on the most critical tasks first and reduce feelings of overwhelm. It might also be helpful to set aside specific times for studying and homework, and try to stick to that schedule as much as possible. What do you think about incorporating some of these strategies?

Patient: Prioritizing tasks sounds like a good idea. I often feel like everything is urgent, so it might help to have a clearer sense of what really needs my immediate attention. I'll give that a try. Setting specific study times is also something I've been meaning to do. I'll start with that and see how it goes. Thanks for the suggestions, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi. I'm glad you find these strategies helpful. Remember, it's all about finding what works best for you, so don't hesitate to adjust and adapt the techniques as needed. Before we dive deeper into our session today, let's take a moment to set an agenda. What would you like to focus on in our time together today? We could discuss how to manage overwhelming feelings related to your academic workload, explore your relationship with your parents and how it's been affecting you lately, or any other topics that feel important to you.

Patient: I think I'd like to focus on managing the overwhelming feelings from my academic workload. It's been really tough lately, and I feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up. I'm also curious about how to better communicate with my parents. Their lack of understanding is really weighing on me, and I don't know how to bridge that gap. But let's start with the academic stress first, if that's okay with you.

Therapist: Absolutely, let's start with the academic stress. It seems to be a major source of distress for you right now. To begin, let's explore the thoughts and feelings that come up when you think about your academic workload. Can you walk me through what goes through your mind when you consider all the tasks you have to complete?

Patient: When I think about my academic workload, I immediately feel a sense of dread. I start to panic about all the deadlines, the research papers, and the presentations. I feel like I'm never going to catch up, and that I'm not smart enough to handle it all. It's like a never-ending cycle of stress and self-doubt. I also worry that if I don't do well, I'll disappoint my parents, even though they don't fully understand me. It's a lot to carry.

Therapist: That's a really overwhelming experience, Naomi. I can understand why you feel stuck in this cycle of stress and self-doubt. Let's take a closer look at the thoughts that are driving these feelings. When you say that you feel like you're not smart enough to handle it all, what evidence do you have that supports this thought?

Patient: Well, there have been a few instances where I've struggled to understand the material or felt like I wasn't performing as well as my peers. I missed a deadline for a paper once, and that made me feel like I was failing. But on the other hand, I've also had moments where I've done well, like when I presented my research at a conference and got positive feedback. So, it's not all bad, but those negative moments really stick with me.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Naomi. You've identified evidence on both sides – the positive feedback from your presentation and the challenges you've faced with some assignments. This is where the concept of cognitive distortions comes in. One common distortion is the "disqualifying the positive," where you focus only on the negative experiences and discount the positive ones. It seems like you might be falling into this pattern. What do you think about that?

Patient: I see what you mean. I do tend to focus more on the negative experiences and forget about the positive ones. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, expecting to fail. But if I start acknowledging the positive moments more, it might help balance things out. Do you have any tips on how to do that?

Therapist: One way to counteract this distortion is to intentionally focus on the positive experiences and accomplishments. You could make a list of them and review it regularly, especially on days when you're feeling down or overwhelmed. This can help create a more balanced perspective. Another strategy is to reframe the negative experiences in a more adaptive way. For example, instead of seeing missing a deadline as "failing," you could view it as a learning opportunity or a chance to improve your time management skills. How do these strategies sound to you?

Patient: That sounds really helpful. I think making a list of positive experiences and reviewing it regularly could really shift my focus. It's easy to forget the good things when I'm stressed out. And reframing missed deadlines as learning opportunities makes a lot of sense. I can see how that could help me feel less defeated and more proactive. I'll definitely give both of these strategies a try.

Therapist: I'm glad you find these strategies helpful, Naomi. Remember, it takes practice to shift your thought patterns, so be patient with yourself. As you work on challenging these distortions, it's also important to practice self-compassion. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer a good friend in a similar situation. Speaking of friends, how has your experience been with the LGBTQ+ support group? Have you noticed any impact on your thoughts and feelings related to self-worth and acceptance?

Patient: The support group has been really impactful. It's comforting to be around people who understand what I'm going through, especially with my family. Hearing their stories and struggles has made me feel less alone and more accepted. It's also helped me see that my feelings of self-doubt and worth are common, and that it's okay to have those moments. I've started to feel more confident in my identity and less afraid to be myself, even around people who might not fully understand.

Therapist: That's such an important realization, Naomi. Recognizing that you're not alone in your experiences and that your feelings are valid can be incredibly validating and empowering. It's great that the support group has provided a space for you to develop more confidence in your identity. As you continue to engage with the group and practice self-compassion, I'm confident that you'll find even more strength and resilience in your journey. How have you been doing with the homework from our last session? Were there any challenges in implementing the techniques we discussed?

Patient: The homework was challenging at first, but I think it's starting to make a difference. I've been keeping a journal of positive experiences and it's been helpful to look back on it when I'm feeling down. I also tried reframing some of my negative thoughts, like when I felt overwhelmed by a project. Instead of thinking "I can't do this," I told myself "I can handle this one step at a time." It's still a work in progress, but I feel like I'm making some headway.

Therapist: That's great to hear, Naomi. It's wonderful that you're seeing some progress with the homework. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay if some days are harder than others. The fact that you're persisting and making an effort is a testament to your resilience and commitment to your well-being. As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in with you about your current emotional state. How are you feeling right now, and what thoughts and feelings are coming up for you?

Patient: Right now, I feel a mix of emotions. I'm relieved to have a space where I can talk about what's going on, but I'm also a bit anxious about the future and how I'll manage everything. I'm worried about my academic performance and whether I'll be able to balance my identity with my family's expectations. But at the same time, I feel hopeful that things can get better with time and effort.

Therapist: It's completely understandable to feel a mix of emotions, Naomi. Life is rarely just one thing, and it's okay to have a range of feelings. The fact that you're feeling hopeful even in the midst of your concerns is a positive sign. It suggests that you have faith in your ability to navigate these challenges. Remember, hope is not the same as perfection. You don't have to figure everything out or be perfect to feel better or move forward. Every small step you take is a victory, and it's okay to celebrate those victories, no matter how small they might seem.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. That really helps to hear. I think I often forget to celebrate the small victories and get too caught up in the bigger picture. I'll try to focus more on those small steps and give myself credit for them. It's nice to have someone remind me that it's okay to feel hopeful and that I'm making progress, even if it's not always visible.

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi. You've made incredible progress over our time together, and it's wonderful to see how your insights and skills are starting to take root. Remember, you have a network of support – from your professors and peers, to your online communities, to your therapy team. You don't have to go through this alone, and it's okay to lean on others when you need to. Speaking of support, let's talk about your homework for the coming week. I'd like you to continue keeping your journal of positive experiences, and practice reframing negative thoughts. Additionally, I'd like you to attend at least one session of the LGBTQ+ support group, if you feel comfortable doing so. How does that sound to you?

Patient: That sounds good. I'll definitely keep up with the journal and try to reframe more of my negative thoughts. And I'll make sure to attend a support group session this week. It's been really helpful to connect with others who understand what I'm going through. I think it'll be a good way to keep building that sense of community and support.

Therapist: That's great, Naomi. I'm excited for you to engage with the support group in this way. Remember, it's completely okay to start small and go at your own pace. You can always share your experiences and thoughts during our sessions, and we can problem-solve together if you run into any challenges. How are you feeling as we wrap up today's session? Do you have any final thoughts or concerns you'd like to discuss before we end?

Patient: I feel a bit more grounded after talking today. I guess my main concern is just making sure I don't slip back into old habits, like self-harm, when things get really tough. I know I have healthier coping mechanisms now, but sometimes the urge is still there. I just want to make sure I'm prepared if that happens again.

Therapist: That's a very important concern, Naomi, and it's one we can definitely address together. When you mention the urge to engage in self-harm, what thoughts come up for you? What makes you most vulnerable to those feelings?

Patient: When I feel the urge to self-harm, it's usually when I'm feeling really overwhelmed and like I can't handle everything on my own. I start thinking that hurting myself will somehow make the pain go away, even if it's just for a little while. It's like a quick escape from the stress and anxiety, but I know it's not a real solution. I guess I feel most vulnerable when I'm exhausted, both physically and emotionally, and when I'm not able to take a break or find a way to relax.

Therapist: That's a really insightful observation, Naomi. You've identified a clear connection between your thoughts and behaviors – when you feel overwhelmed, the thought of self-harm becomes an appealing escape. And when you're exhausted and unable to take a break, those thoughts feel more intense and overwhelming. This is exactly the kind of relationship we've been working on in our cognitive-behavioral therapy – identifying how our thoughts influence our feelings and behaviors. What we want to do is break that cycle and find healthier ways to cope with your stress and pain.

Patient: Exactly, that's what I want to do. I want to break that cycle and find better ways to cope. I just need to figure out what those healthier ways are and make sure I practice them enough so they become second nature.

Therapist: That's exactly right, Naomi. You've already started to develop those healthier coping mechanisms, and now we just need to keep strengthening them so they become automatic. One great way to do this is to create a "wellness plan" – a personalized set of strategies and reminders that you can turn to when you're feeling overwhelmed or tempted by self-harm. We can work on creating this plan together. What are some coping mechanisms that you think could be helpful for you?

Patient: I think journaling and talking to my support network are definitely helpful. I also find that going for a walk or doing some yoga helps to clear my mind and calm me down. And sometimes, just taking a few deep breaths and reminding myself that I can get through this helps a lot.

Therapist: Those are all fantastic coping mechanisms, Naomi. Journaling, talking to your support network, going for walks, doing yoga, and deep breathing – all of these can be incredibly helpful in managing stress and overwhelming emotions. What I like about these strategies is that they're all very accessible and can be done even when you're feeling overwhelmed or unable to do much else. We can add these to your wellness plan as reminders of what you can turn to when you need a break or need to calm yourself.

Patient: That sounds like a solid plan, Nova. I think having those strategies written down in a wellness plan will really help me remember to use them, especially when I'm in the middle of a stressful situation. I'm curious, though—how often should I review and update this plan? And should I keep it somewhere specific, like on my phone or next to my desk?

Therapist: Those are great questions, Naomi. I recommend that you review and update your wellness plan regularly, maybe once a week or whenever you notice your emotions shifting. This will help keep it fresh in your mind and make it easier to turn to when you need it. Keeping it on your phone or in a notes app is a great idea – that way, you'll have it handy whenever you need a reminder. You can also consider sharing your wellness plan with someone you trust, like a friend or family member, so that they can be your support system when you're struggling.

Patient: That makes sense. I'll definitely keep it on my phone so it's always accessible. And I think sharing it with my sister could be really helpful. She's been really supportive, and I know she'd be there to remind me to use my coping strategies if I forget. Thanks, Nova. I feel a bit more confident about managing my stress now.

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi. I'm so glad to hear that you feel a bit more confident. You've done a great job of identifying your personal strengths and resources, and I'm impressed by your willingness to create a wellness plan that can help you through difficult times. Remember, this plan is a living document – you can always add to it and adjust it as you learn more about what works best for you. How are you feeling as we wrap up today's session? Do you have any final thoughts or questions you'd like to share?

Patient: I'm feeling pretty good about today's session. I think having a wellness plan is going to be really helpful. I don't have any final questions, but I do want to make sure I'm clear on one thing—should I start using the wellness plan immediately, or should I wait until I'm in a particularly stressful situation to try it out?

Therapist: That's a great question, Naomi. I recommend that you start using your wellness plan even when you're not in a particularly stressful situation. The more you practice these coping strategies, the easier it will be to turn to them when you're in a stressful moment. You can also practice with your wellness plan when you're not feeling overwhelmed, just to get a sense of how it feels to use these strategies and remind yourself of their benefits. That way, when you do find yourself in a stressful situation, you'll have a better sense of how to use your wellness plan to help yourself through it. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a good approach. I'll start practicing with the wellness plan even when I'm not feeling stressed, so it becomes more natural to use when I really need it. Thanks for the advice, Nova. I think this will really help me in the long run.

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi. I'm glad this approach resonates with you. Remember, the more you practice using your wellness plan and coping strategies, the more automatic they'll become. It's like building a muscle – the more you use it, the stronger it gets. And just like building a muscle, it takes time and consistent effort. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. I have faith in you, Naomi. I know you have the strength and resilience to navigate these challenges, and your wellness plan will be a valuable tool for you along the way.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your encouragement. I'll definitely keep practicing and celebrating the small victories. It's nice to know that I have a plan and that I'm not alone in this. I'm looking forward to seeing how it helps me in the future.

Therapist: You've made so much progress, Naomi. I'm excited to see how your wellness plan and other coping strategies help you in the future. Remember, you can always reach out for support if you need it. You don't have to go through this alone. I'm here to support you every step of the way. How are you feeling as we wrap up today's session?

Patient: I'm feeling pretty good about today's session. I'm excited to start using my wellness plan and see how it helps me. I think having this plan will make a big difference in how I handle stress and difficult situations. Thanks for all your support, Nova. I'm looking forward to our next session.

Therapist: You're welcome, Naomi. I'm so glad to hear that you're feeling good about today's session and that you're excited to start using your wellness plan. Remember, the more you practice these coping strategies, the more automatic they'll become. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way. I know you have the strength and resilience to navigate these challenges, and your wellness plan will be a valuable tool for you along the way. I'm excited to see how it helps you in the future. How are you feeling as we wrap up today's session?

Patient: I'm feeling really positive about today's session. I'm excited to start using my wellness plan and see how it helps me manage stress and difficult situations. Thanks for all your support, Nova. I'm looking forward to our next session.
