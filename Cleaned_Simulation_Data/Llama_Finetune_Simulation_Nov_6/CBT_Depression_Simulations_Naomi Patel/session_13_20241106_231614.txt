Therapist: Welcome back, Naomi. It's great to see you again for our 13th session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our last meeting. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me during our sessions, and there's a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, while I'm here to support you, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also want to note that since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret any non-verbal cues.

Patient: Thank you for the reminder, Nova. It's good to be back. I appreciate your transparency about your limitations. I'll keep that in mind as we talk. So, where should we start today? I've been trying out those relaxation apps and practicing the muscle relaxation techniques during my breaks. It's been interesting, but I'm not sure if I'm doing everything right.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear you've been working on the relaxation techniques we discussed last time. It's completely normal to have doubts or feel uncertain about whether you're doing things correctly. The important thing is that you're making an effort and trying to incorporate these practices into your daily life. Let's start by exploring your experience with using the relaxation apps and paired muscle relaxation during your breaks. Can you tell me more about how it's been going? What you've been noticing? What's been challenging?

Patient: Sure, I've been using the "Breathe2Relax" app mostly. It's been helpful to have a visual guide for my breathing, especially during those moments when I feel really stressed. The deep breathing exercises have definitely helped me calm down a bit. However, I find it hard to remember to use it consistently. Sometimes I get so caught up in my work that I forget to take breaks altogether.

As for the paired muscle relaxation, I've been trying to do it during my breaks, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly. I tense up my muscles and then release, but I don't always feel a big difference afterward. Maybe I'm not holding the tension long enough or something?

Therapist: It's great that you've been using the "Breathe2Relax" app and noticing some benefits from the deep breathing exercises. Consistency is a key factor, and it's understandable that it can be challenging to remember to take breaks and use these techniques regularly. With practice, it will become more natural. As for the paired muscle relaxation, it's possible that you're not holding the tension for long enough. The ideal duration is typically about 5-10 seconds for each muscle group. However, the most important thing is that you're making an effort to incorporate these techniques into your routine. Remember, it's okay to start small and gradually build up.

Given what you've shared, I'd like to suggest a few agenda items for our session today. First, we could explore ways to make the relaxation techniques more accessible and integrated into your daily life. Second, we could discuss your progress with communicating with your parents about self-care and how to plan and prepare for that conversation. Finally, we could review your experience with tracking your work breaks and their effectiveness. What do you think about this agenda? Is there anything else you'd like to add or prioritize?

Patient: To be honest, I haven't been using the apps as much as I thought I would. I get caught up in my work and forget to take breaks. When I do remember, I feel guilty about taking the time away from studying. The deep breathing does help when I remember to do it, but I'm not consistent with it. As for the paired muscle relaxation, I find it hard to hold the tension for the whole 5-10 seconds. Most of the time, I just do it for a second or two and then let go. 

About communication with my parents, I haven't made much progress. I still feel hesitant and unsure about how to approach the topic. Every time I think about it, I get anxious and end up putting it off. 

I guess my main priorities for today would be figuring out how to make relaxation practices more consistent and figuring out a plan for talking to my parents. Tracking work breaks isn't something I've been able to maintain either, so maybe we can talk about that too.

Therapist: It sounds like consistency has been a challenge for you, both in terms of using the relaxation techniques and tracking your work breaks. It's not uncommon to feel guilty or anxious about taking breaks, especially when you're used to putting your work first. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about what's behind those feelings of guilt and anxiety? What thoughts come up for you when you think about taking breaks from studying?

Patient: I think part of it is my parents' influence. They've always emphasized the importance of academic success, almost to the point of sacrificing everything else. Every time I think about taking a break, I hear their voices in my head telling me I should be studying instead. It feels like if I'm not constantly working, I'm falling behind or letting them down. Plus, the pressure I put on myself to excel in my program doesn't help. I keep thinking, "If I take a break now, I won't get this paper done on time" or "I'll lose momentum." It's like my brain is wired to always prioritize work over self-care.

Therapist: It's interesting that you mentioned your parent's influence and the pressure you put on yourself. It seems like there are some deeply held beliefs around the importance of academic success and the sacrifice of self-care. These beliefs have been reinforced over time and have become automatic thoughts for you. Let's take a closer look at these beliefs and explore how they might be impacting your emotions and behaviors related to taking breaks and practicing self-care.

Can you think of a specific situation recently where you felt guilty or anxious about taking a break? Let's use the thought record technique to break down this situation and examine the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that came up. We can start by identifying the situation or trigger, the emotions you experienced, and the intensity of those emotions. Then, we can explore the thoughts that were going through your mind and the behaviors you engaged in. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a good approach. Let's see... A specific situation that comes to mind is last week when I had a particularly tough day. I was working on a research paper that was due in a few days, and I was feeling really overwhelmed. I knew I needed a break, but every time I thought about stepping away from my desk, I felt this intense guilt. I ended up staying at my desk for hours without a break, and by the end of the day, I was exhausted and my concentration was shot.

So, the situation was working on a research paper with a tight deadline. The emotions I felt were guilt (intense), anxiety (moderate), and exhaustion (high). The thoughts that were going through my mind were things like, "If I take a break now, I won't finish this on time," "My parents would be disappointed if they knew I wasn't working constantly," and "I'll lose momentum if I stop now." As for behaviors, I just kept working without taking any breaks, which led to feeling even more exhausted and less productive.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Naomi. Now that we've identified the situation, emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, let's explore this further using the cognitive model. The model suggests that our emotions are driven by our thoughts, not necessarily by the situations themselves. In other words, the thoughts you were having about taking a break – like "If I take a break now, I won't finish this on time" and "My parents would be disappointed if they knew I wasn't working constantly" – are what led to your feelings of guilt, anxiety, and exhaustion. These thoughts can be considered cognitive distortions because they don't take into account the actual reality of the situation.

One common cognitive distortion is called "all-or-nothing thinking," where you see things in extreme or absolute terms. For example, the thought "If I take a break now, I won't finish this on time" assumes that you'll be unable to work effectively after taking a break. However, there's evidence that taking breaks can actually improve your productivity and concentration. It's not an all-or-nothing situation.

Another distortion is "fortune telling," where you predict negative outcomes without evidence. The thought "My parents would be disappointed if they knew I wasn't working constantly" assumes that your parents would be disappointed even though you haven't actually talked to them about your need for breaks.

Let's look at these thoughts now and try to reframe them in a more balanced and realistic way. What would be a more helpful or accurate way to think about taking breaks in relation to your work and your parents' expectations?

Patient: I see what you mean about those cognitive distortions. It's true that I tend to think in extremes and predict negative outcomes without any real evidence. When you put it that way, it seems like my thoughts are more about fear and assumptions than actual reality.

A more balanced thought about taking breaks might be, "Taking a short break now can actually help me recharge and be more productive later." This acknowledges that breaks can be beneficial and doesn't assume that I'll lose all my progress if I step away for a few minutes.

As for my parents' expectations, a more realistic thought could be, "My parents want me to succeed, but they might be open to understanding that taking care of myself is part of that success." This thought acknowledges their support for my academic goals while also considering that they might be more understanding than I assume.

Does that sound like a good reframing?

Therapist: That's an excellent reframe, Naomi. Reframing our thoughts in a more balanced and realistic way can have a significant impact on our emotions and behaviors. By recognizing that taking breaks can actually improve productivity and that your parents may be more understanding than you assume, you open up new possibilities for approaching self-care and communicating with them about your needs.

Let's practice applying this reframe to the situation you described earlier this week. Imagine yourself in the same situation, but this time with these more balanced thoughts in mind. How might your emotions and behaviors change?

Patient: If I had these more balanced thoughts in mind, I think I would feel less guilty and anxious about taking a break. Instead of feeling like I'm sacrificing my work or disappointing my parents, I'd feel like I'm making a smart decision to recharge and be more productive later.

So, instead of pushing through and feeling exhausted, I might actually take a short break, maybe do some deep breathing or a quick walk around the block. This could help me clear my mind and come back to my work with renewed focus. I might also feel more confident about eventually talking to my parents about self-care, knowing that they might be more supportive than I initially thought.

It's interesting how just changing my thoughts can lead to such different behaviors and emotions.

Therapist: You're absolutely right, Naomi. That's the core principle of the cognitive model – our thoughts have a powerful influence on our emotions and behaviors. By reframing our thoughts in a more balanced and realistic way, we can open up new possibilities for approaching situations and engaging in self-care.

I'm glad we were able to practice this process together. As we continue with therapy, we'll work on building more of these cognitive and behavioral skills, so that you feel more empowered to manage your stress, communicate your needs, and prioritize self-care.

How are you feeling about what we've discussed so far today? Is there anything else you'd like to explore or any questions you have?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful about managing my stress and taking breaks now. It's reassuring to know that I can change my thoughts and behaviors to be more balanced. I do have a question, though. How can I start implementing these new thoughts and behaviors in my daily routine? I know it's one thing to understand the theory, but another to actually put it into practice. Do you have any tips or exercises to help with that?

Therapist: That's a great question, Naomi. The process of implementing new thoughts and behaviors is called "skill building," and it's a key part of CBT. Skill building involves practicing new behaviors and ways of thinking until they become automatic, just like your old patterns of thinking and behaving.

One effective way to build new skills is to set specific, measurable goals for yourself. For example, you could set a goal to take a short break (15 minutes) every 2 hours while working on a research paper. This way, you have a clear target to aim for, and you can track your progress over time.

Another helpful technique is to create a "coping card" with reminders of your balanced thoughts. You could write down phrases like "Taking breaks is actually good for productivity" or "My parents may be more understanding than I think." Keep this card with you and look at it whenever you notice yourself feeling guilty or anxious about taking a break.

We can also practice some behavioral experiments to test out your new thoughts and see how they work in real-life situations. For example, you could try taking a 15-minute break, and then observe what happens. Do you feel recharged and more productive afterward? What does your productivity look like when you do take breaks?

These are just some ideas for how you can start implementing these new thoughts and behaviors. The key is to practice consistently, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. Over time, these new patterns will become more automatic, and you'll start to notice the positive impacts on your stress levels and overall well-being.

What do you think about starting with some of these skill-building exercises? We can create a plan together based on your specific goals and challenges.

### Patient's Response:
I think those skill-building exercises sound helpful. I like the idea of setting specific goals and creating a coping card. And the idea of testing out my new thoughts through behavioral experiments makes a lot of sense.

So, maybe I could start by setting a goal to take a 15-minute break every 2 hours while working on a research paper. And then I could create a coping card with reminders like "Breaks are good for productivity" and "My parents might be more understanding than I think."

I could also try a behavioral experiment, like taking a 15-minute break in the middle of writing a paper and seeing how it affects my productivity afterward.

Patient: That sounds like a great plan, Naomi. Setting specific goals, creating a coping card, and conducting behavioral experiments are all excellent strategies for building new skills and integrating them into your daily routine.

Let's break down the plan a bit more:

1. **Setting Specific Goals:**
   - **Goal:** Take a 15-minute break every 2 hours while working on a research paper.
   - **How to Track:** Use a timer or an app to remind you when it's time for a break. You can also keep a small journal to note down how you feel before and after each break.

2. **Creating a Coping Card:**
   - **Content:** Write down phrases like "Breaks are good for productivity" and "My parents might be more understanding than I think."
   - **How to Use:** Keep the coping card with you, perhaps in your study area or in your bag. Look at it whenever you feel guilty or anxious about taking a break.

3. **Conducting Behavioral Experiments:**
   - **Experiment:** Take a 15-minute break in the middle of writing a paper and observe the impact on your productivity.
   - **How to Track:** After the break, note down how you feel, whether you feel recharged, and how your productivity changes afterward. You can also compare this to times when you didn't take a break.

By

Therapist: Now that we've laid out a clear plan for implementing your new thoughts and behaviors, let's discuss how to make this plan realistic and sustainable for you. One important aspect to consider is identifying potential barriers or challenges that might come up, and brainstorming strategies to overcome them.

For example, what might make it challenging for you to take a 15-minute break every 2 hours? What might get in the way of looking at your coping card when you're feeling anxious? What obstacles might you encounter while conducting behavioral experiments?

### Patient's Response:
I think one barrier for me is that I can often get caught up in the work and forget to take breaks. Especially when I'm in the research paper writing phase, it can feel like there's so much to do and not enough time. Another barrier could be if I'm feeling really stressed and overwhelmed, it might be hard to motivate myself to take a break, even though I know it's important.

As for the coping card, I can see myself forgetting to look at it when I'm feeling anxious. I might need a reminder, like taping the card to my computer screen or setting a reminder on my phone.

For the behavioral experiment, the main challenge might be that I have this inner voice telling me I'll fall behind or miss something important if I take a break. I might need to counter that voice with reminders about the importance of breaks and my new balanced thoughts.

Patient: You've identified some very realistic barriers, Naomi. It's great that you're already thinking about potential challenges and how to address them. Let's refine your plan by incorporating strategies to overcome these barriers:

1. **Overcoming the Barrier of Forgetting to Take Breaks:**
   - **Strategy:** Use a timer or an app to remind you to take breaks. You can set it to go off every 2 hours. Apps like "Break Reminder" or "Mindful Break" can be helpful.
   - **Additional Strategy:** Break down your work into smaller tasks with specific time limits. For example, work on one section of your paper for 45 minutes, then take a 15-minute break. This can make it easier to remember to take breaks and also make your work feel more manageable.

2. **Ensuring You Look at Your Coping Card:**
   - **Strategy:** Tape the coping card to your computer screen or somewhere you'll see it frequently. You can also set a reminder on your phone to check the card at specific times, like before you start working or during your breaks.
   - **Additional Strategy:** Practice mindfulness or grounding techniques to help you remember to use the coping card when you're feeling anxious. For example, taking a few deep breaths and reminding yourself to look at the card can be helpful.

3. **Countering the Inner Voice During Behavioral Experiments:**

Therapist: These additional strategies should help you overcome the main barriers we identified. How are you feeling about this updated plan? Do you feel like you have a clear roadmap for implementing your new thoughts and behaviors?

### Patient's Response:
I feel much more prepared and confident now that we've talked about potential barriers and how to overcome them. Having a clear plan with strategies makes it feel more possible to actually implement these changes in my daily routine.

I think I'm going to start by using the timer reminder app you mentioned, and try to break my work into smaller tasks with breaks in between. I'll also work on taping the coping card to my computer screen, so I have a visual reminder to look at when I'm feeling anxious.

I'll also try to be mindful of that inner voice that says I'll fall behind if I take a break. I'll remind myself of the balanced thoughts we talked about today, like "Breaks are good for productivity" and "My parents might be more understanding than I think."

It's still going to be challenging, but I feel like I have more tools to manage my stress and prioritize self-care now.

### Therapist's Response:
That's great to hear, Naomi. I'm really encouraged by your enthusiasm and willingness to put these new skills into practice. Remember, it's okay if it's challenging at first. The important thing is that you keep trying, even if you stumble along the way.

As we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made. You've developed a clear plan for implementing your new thoughts and behaviors, and you've identified some effective strategies to overcome barriers. You're also practicing reframing your thoughts and challenging cognitive distortions, which is a crucial part of CBT.

I also want to encourage you to continue practicing these skills outside of our sessions. The more you practice, the more automatic these new patterns will become. And remember, it's okay to take small steps and celebrate your progress along the way.

For homework this week, I'd like you to:

1. Use the timer reminder app to take a 15-minute break every 2 hours while working on a research paper. Note down how you feel before and after the break, and compare it to times when you didn't take a break.

2. Create a coping card with balanced thoughts, and tape it to your computer screen or somewhere you'll see it frequently. Look at the card whenever you feel guilty or anxious about taking a break.

3. Practice reframing your thoughts using the cognitive restructuring techniques we've discussed, especially when you notice cognitive distortions like all-or-nothing thinking or fortune telling.

We can review your progress and experiences with these exercises at our next session. In the meantime, feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

How are you feeling about the homework and our overall plan moving forward?
### Patient's Response:
I feel really good about the homework and our overall plan. I.

Patient: I feel really good about the homework and our overall plan. I appreciate the step-by-step approach and the specific strategies you've given me. It makes it feel more manageable and less overwhelming.

I'm definitely going to start using the timer reminder app and breaking my work into smaller tasks with breaks in between. I'll also make sure to create and use the coping card as a visual reminder.

As for the cognitive restructuring, I'll try to be mindful of my thoughts and practice reframing them when I notice those cognitive distortions. It's going to be a bit of a challenge, but I'm ready to give it my best effort.

I'm looking forward to seeing how these changes impact my stress levels and productivity. I'll keep a journal to track my progress and any insights I gain along the way.

Thank you, Nova, for your support and guidance. I feel more hopeful and empowered to tackle these challenges now. I'll see you at our next session to discuss how everything goes.
