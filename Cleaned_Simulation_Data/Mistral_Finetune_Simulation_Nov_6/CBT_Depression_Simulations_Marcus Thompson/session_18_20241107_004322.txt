Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again for session 18. We've been working on managing stress related to your mother's declining health, addressing perfectionist thinking, and finding ways to balance your responsibilities and prioritize self-care. How have things been since our last session?

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for asking. Things have been pretty hectic, as usual. I've been trying to stick to the "worry time" you suggested, but it's tough to carve out that 15-20 minutes every day. I did manage to do it a few times, and it helped a bit, but I still find myself ruminating late at night. 

On the positive side, I've been working on those smaller, achievable goals, like spending a little more time with the kids each day. It's made a difference, even if it's just reading them a bedtime story instead of rushing off to work. 

I've also been trying to be more mindful of my "should" statements. It's hard to break the habit, but I can see how they add to my stress. I've been keeping a thought record, but I could use some more guidance on how to really challenge those thoughts effectively.

Therapist: Marcus, I'm glad to hear that you've been making progress with setting smaller, achievable goals and being mindful of your "should" statements. It's a great step that you've been keeping a thought record, and I'm here to help you refine your skills in challenging those thoughts.

You're right, carving out "worry time" can be difficult, especially when stress levels are high. Let's explore how we can make that work better for you. Perhaps we can start with a smaller amount of time, like 10 minutes, and gradually increase it as you get more comfortable with the practice.

Another helpful technique is to create a "worry list" during your "worry time." This can help you identify specific concerns and address them one at a time, rather than letting your mind spin in circles.

What do you think about that idea? Do you have any other concerns or questions you'd like to discuss today?

Patient: That sounds like a good idea, starting with a shorter "worry time" and gradually increasing it. I think the "worry list" could be really helpful too. It might keep me from getting overwhelmed by all the things I need to think about.

One thing that's been on my mind is how to balance my responsibilities at school with caring for my mom. I feel like I'm constantly juggling, and it's hard to give my best to both. I end up feeling guilty no matter what I do. Any tips on how to manage that better?

Therapist: Marcus, the challenge of balancing school responsibilities with caregiving is a common one for many people. It's understandable that you feel guilty no matter which task you prioritize, as both are important parts of your life.

One approach is to consider your goals for each area of your life and work on finding a balance that allows you to meet your responsibilities while also taking care of yourself. This might mean setting boundaries around your schoolwork, such as dedicating specific times to study and leaving time for self-care and family.

Another helpful technique is to practice self-compassion when feelings of guilt arise. Remind yourself that you're doing the best you can in a difficult situation, and that it's okay to prioritize your needs at times.

We can also explore how to simplify your caregiving responsibilities, such as delegating tasks to others or seeking support from your community. These strategies can help reduce stress and improve your overall well-being.

What are your thoughts on this approach? Do you have any concerns or questions about implementing these strategies?

Patient: I think setting boundaries and practicing self-compassion are good ideas. It's hard to remember that I'm doing the best I can when I'm so caught up in everything. 

As for simplifying caregiving tasks, I've been trying to get some help from the community, but it's not always easy to find reliable people. I've been looking into some local support groups for caregivers, though, and that might help.

One concern I have is that I don't want to seem like I'm neglecting my mom or my students. I feel like I need to be there for both, and it's hard to let go of that expectation. Any tips on how to manage that guilt?

Therapist: Marcus, it's understandable that you feel torn between your responsibilities to your mother and your students. It's important to remember that asking for help and setting boundaries is not the same as neglecting your loved ones. In fact, by taking care of yourself, you're better able to support those around you.

One way to manage this guilt is to reframe your thoughts around asking for help. Instead of seeing it as giving up or neglecting others, try to view it as an act of self-care that allows you to be more present and effective in your other roles.

Another strategy is to communicate openly with your family members and professors about your situation and your needs. Be honest about what you're going through and what kind of support you need. This can help alleviate some of the pressure you feel and make it easier to manage your responsibilities.

Remember, you don't have to do everything alone. It's okay to lean on others and accept help when it's offered. In fact, it's a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you need support.

What are your thoughts on these strategies? Do you feel like they could help you manage your guilt and stress more effectively?

Patient: I appreciate the suggestions, Nova. It's hard for me to ask for help because I've always been the one others rely on. I worry that if I ask for support, it might come across as weakness. But I can see how accepting help could actually benefit everyone in the long run.

I've been trying to set boundaries with my schoolwork by designating specific times for lesson planning and grading. It's helped a bit, but I still feel like I'm stretched too thin. Maybe more open communication with my colleagues about my caregiving responsibilities could help them understand and perhaps offer more support.

I'm also curious about how to delegate caregiving tasks to others. I've been hesitant because I don't want to burden anyone, but maybe there are ways to involve friends or family in small, manageable ways that wouldn't feel like a huge imposition.

Could you provide some specific examples of how I might delegate caregiving tasks or communicate my needs more effectively with my colleagues and family? I think concrete examples would really help me understand how to put these strategies into practice.

Therapist: Marcus, it's understandable that you're hesitant to ask for help or delegate tasks, especially given your feelings of guilt and the belief that asking for support is a sign of weakness. However, as we've discussed, asking for help and setting boundaries are actually acts of self-care that can improve your overall well-being and allow you to better support others.

Let's discuss some specific examples of how you might approach delegating caregiving tasks and communicating your needs with your colleagues and family members.

One way to start delegating tasks is to identify specific responsibilities that you could ask others to help with. This might include things like grocery shopping, meal preparation, or providing your mother with companionship while you're unable to be there. Remember, delegating doesn't mean completely handing over responsibility; it's about sharing the burden with others in a way that feels comfortable for you and your loved ones.

When communicating your needs to others, it can be helpful to be specific and clear about what you're asking for. For example, you could say something like, "I'm feeling overwhelmed with my schoolwork and caring for my mother right now. I was wondering if you could help with grocery shopping this week, so that I can have some dedicated time to focus on my studies."

Another way to approach this is to offer others specific opportunities to support you, rather than just expecting them to know what you need. For example, you could say, "I know you've been great with kids in the past. Would you be available to come over on Thursday evenings to spend some time with my mom while I attend my class?"

By being specific and clear about what you need, you make it easier for others to understand and support you, while also reducing feelings of guilt or burden.

What do you think about these examples, Marcus? Do you feel like they provide some concrete ways to approach delegating tasks and communicating your needs?

Patient: Those examples are really helpful, Nova. I can see how being specific about what I need and offering opportunities for others to help could make a difference. It takes some of the pressure off, knowing that I'm not just asking for a vague favor.

I think I'll start by talking to my sister about helping with grocery shopping and maybe some light housework at my mom's place. She's been asking how she can help, so this could be a good way to involve her without feeling like I'm dumping everything on her.

As for my colleagues at school, I might bring up my situation in our next staff meeting and see if anyone is willing to cover a few of my classes on certain days so I can focus on caregiving. It's a bit nerve-wracking to ask, but I think it's worth a try.

I'm also going to keep practicing self-compassion and reminding myself that it's okay to need help. It's not a sign of weakness, but rather a way to manage my stress and be more effective in all areas of my life.

Thanks for the guidance, Nova. I feel a bit more hopeful about finding a balance now.

Therapist: Marcus, I'm glad to hear that you've found these examples helpful and that you're feeling more hopeful about finding a balance. It's great that you're planning to talk to your sister and your colleagues about ways to get support. Remember, asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.

As we discussed earlier, practicing self-compassion is an important part of managing stress and anxiety. When you find yourself feeling guilty or overwhelmed, take a moment to acknowledge your feelings and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can in a difficult situation. This can help you approach asking for help and setting boundaries with a more compassionate mindset.

I also want to acknowledge the progress you've made in our sessions together. You've been working hard to apply the techniques we've discussed, like thought records and self-compassion, and it shows in your ability to recognize and challenge perfectionistic thinking patterns. This is a big step forward in managing your stress and improving your overall well-being.

As we wrap up our session today, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling and if there are any other concerns or questions you'd like to discuss. It's also important to talk about some homework assignments to help you continue practicing these skills outside of our sessions.

What are your thoughts and feelings as we wrap up today? Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?

Patient: I appreciate the encouragement, Nova. It's been a lot of work, but I can see some progress, and that feels good. I'm definitely going to keep practicing self-compassion and working on those thought records.

As for homework, I think it would be helpful to focus on more specific ways to challenge my perfectionistic thinking. I tend to get caught up in thinking that everything has to be perfect, and that's not realistic. Maybe some exercises or examples on how to reframe those thoughts would be really useful.

I also want to keep working on setting boundaries with my schoolwork and caregiving responsibilities. It's still a struggle to find that balance, but I'm hopeful that with practice, it'll get easier.

Is there anything else you think I should focus on for our next session? I'm open to suggestions.

Therapist: Marcus, I'm glad to hear that you're feeling some progress and that you're open to suggestions for our next session.

Based on what we've discussed today and the progress you've made, I think it would be helpful to continue practicing self-compassion and challenging perfectionistic thoughts. We could also review some examples of how to reframe those thoughts in a more balanced way.

In addition, we could discuss the boundaries you've set and how you can continue to communicate your needs effectively with your colleagues and family. We can also explore any challenges that come up as you continue to implement these strategies.

Do you agree with this plan? Is there anything else you'd like to see addressed in our next session?

Patient: Yes, that plan sounds good to me. I think continuing to work on self-compassion and challenging perfectionistic thoughts will be really beneficial. And it's important to keep talking about boundaries and communication, especially as I try to implement those changes in my daily life.

I'm also curious about any specific techniques or exercises that could help me stay consistent with these practices. Sometimes it's hard to remember to apply these strategies when I'm caught up in the moment.

I'm looking forward to our next session and seeing how I can continue to make progress. Thanks for your support, Nova.

Therapist: Marcus, I'm glad that our plan for our next session resonates with you. It's great that you're curious about techniques and exercises to help you stay consistent with these practices.

One strategy that can be helpful is to create a list of self-compassionate statements that you can refer to when you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed. These can be simple phrases like "I'm doing the best I can" or "It's okay to make mistakes."

Another technique is to practice mindfulness throughout the day, even in small moments. This can help you stay grounded and less caught up in negative thoughts. One way to do this is to take a few deep breaths when you find yourself getting stuck in perfectionistic thinking, and then gently redirect your attention to the present moment.

In addition, we can continue to review and practice thought records, with a focus on reframing perfectionistic thoughts. By challenging these thoughts and finding more balanced perspectives, you can reduce the stress and anxiety they cause.

Do you have any questions or concerns about these techniques or exercises? How do you think they might apply to your specific challenges and goals?

Patient: Those techniques sound really helpful, Nova. I think having a list of self-compassionate statements to refer to will be especially useful. It's easy to forget to be kind to myself when I'm feeling stressed.

Mindfulness is something I've tried before, but I haven't been very consistent with it. Maybe starting with those small moments, like taking a few deep breaths, could help me get back into the habit.

I'm also looking forward to continuing with the thought records. I've found them really helpful in identifying and challenging those perfectionistic thoughts. It's been eye-opening to see how much those thoughts affect my mood and behavior.

I think these techniques will definitely apply to my challenges and goals. I want to be more consistent with self-compassion and mindfulness, and the thought records will help me keep challenging those perfectionistic thoughts.

Thanks for the suggestions, Nova. I'm feeling more confident about continuing to make progress.

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. I'm glad that these techniques resonate with you and that you have a plan for applying them to your specific challenges and goals.

As you continue to practice self-compassion and mindfulness, remember that it's okay to take it one step at a time. It's normal to have ups and downs, and the important thing is to keep practicing and not get discouraged if it feels challenging at times.

And with the thought records, it's great that you've found them helpful in identifying and challenging perfectionistic thoughts. As you continue to use this tool, you'll likely find it easier to catch those thoughts and reframe them in a more balanced way.

Before we wrap up, let's assign some homework to help you practice these techniques. I suggest that you:

1. Create a list of self-compassionate statements that you can refer to when you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed. Try to use them at least once a day, even when you're not feeling particularly stressed, to build the habit.

2. Practice mindfulness for a few minutes each day, using deep breathing or any other mindfulness technique that feels comfortable for you. Set a reminder on your phone or calendar to help you remember.

3. Continue using thought records to catch and challenge perfectionistic thoughts. Try to set aside 10-15 minutes each day to reflect on your thoughts and complete a thought record.

How does this homework plan sound to you? Do you have any questions or concerns about it?

Patient: That homework plan sounds good to me, Nova. I think it's manageable and will help me stay consistent with these practices.

Creating a list of self-compassionate statements is something I can definitely do. I'll start with a few that come to mind and add more as I think of them.

Practicing mindfulness for a few minutes each day is also something I can commit to. Setting a reminder on my phone will help me remember to do it.

And continuing with the thought records is important for me. I'll make sure to set aside that time each day to reflect and challenge those perfectionistic thoughts.

I don't have any questions or concerns about the homework plan. I'm ready to give it a try and see how it goes.

Thanks for your support, Nova. I'm looking forward to our next session and seeing how I can continue to make progress.

Therapist: Marcus, I'm glad to hear that the homework plan resonates with you and that you're feeling motivated to practice these techniques.

Remember, the goal is not perfection, but rather progress. It's okay if you miss a day or struggle with a particular technique. The important thing is to keep practicing and being kind to yourself in the process.

I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences with the homework plan in our next session. If you have any questions or concerns that come up as you practice, feel free to bring them up so we can discuss and problem-solve together.

Before we end, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling now. What are your final thoughts as we wrap up our session today?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the reminder that it's about progress, not perfection. That's something I need to keep in mind as I work on these techniques.

As we wrap up today, I feel hopeful and motivated to continue making progress. I'm looking forward to seeing how these practices help me manage my stress and improve my overall well-being.

I'll definitely bring any questions or concerns to our next session. I'm committed to making the most of our time together and continuing to work on these important skills.

Thanks again for your support, Nova. I'm feeling good about our session today and ready to tackle the homework.
