Therapist: Marcus, it's great to see you again for session 17. I'm the AI therapist, and before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. Sometimes, I might generate inaccurate information or lack the ability to interpret non-verbal cues. Additionally, if you ever experience thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please know that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. In those cases, I would guide you to seek appropriate help. Do you have any questions or concerns about my role and capabilities?

Patient: No, I don't have any concerns about your role, Nova. I appreciate the transparency. Let's dive into the session. I've been trying the mindfulness walking exercise, and it's been interesting. It's helping me clear my head a bit, especially after a long day at school. But I'm still struggling with my mom's health. Her condition seems to be getting worse, and it's really weighing on me.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that the mindfulness walking exercise has been helpful for you, Marcus. It's great that you've been practicing it consistently. I understand that your mother's declining health is a significant source of stress for you. Let's make sure to discuss this further during our session today. How has your mood been since our last session?

Patient: My mood has been pretty up and down. Some days I feel like I'm managing everything okay, but other days, like when I see my mom struggling more, it just hits me hard. I've also noticed that I've been stress eating more, especially late at night. It's like I can't stop myself from going back to the kitchen for another slice of sweet potato pie.

Therapist: It's common to experience fluctuations in mood when dealing with chronic stress and emotional challenges. I appreciate your honesty about the difficulty in managing your emotions. Stress eating is often a coping mechanism for many people, and it's something we can work on together. Let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize?

Patient: I think I want to focus on finding healthier ways to cope with stress, especially when it comes to my mom's health. I also want to talk about how to better manage my time so I can be more present for both my kids and my mom without feeling so overwhelmed.

Therapist: Those are great priorities, Marcus. Let's definitely focus on developing healthier coping strategies and time management techniques. We can also explore ways to set small boundaries to help you balance your responsibilities. How has the thought record practice been going for you? Have you been noticing any patterns in your thinking related to perfectionism?

Patient: The thought record practice has been helpful. I've noticed that I tend to have a lot of "should" statements, like "I should be doing more for my mom" or "I should be a better father." It's been eye-opening to see how these thoughts contribute to my stress and guilt.

Therapist: You're making some great insights, Marcus. Recognizing the prevalence of "should" statements is an important step in challenging perfectionistic thinking. These types of thoughts can contribute to feelings of guilt, inadequacy, and stress. Today, let's focus on exploring these thoughts further and developing strategies to reframe them. We can also discuss additional coping techniques to help you manage the emotional impact of your mother's health and caregiving responsibilities. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds good, Nova. I'm ready to dive in and see if we can find some ways to make things a bit more manageable. Let's start with those "should" statements and see how we can reframe them.

Therapist: Let's start by looking at a specific situation where you noticed yourself having "should" statements. Can you share an example?

Patient: Sure. Just the other day, I was at my mom's place, and she was having a particularly rough day with her memory. I found myself thinking, "I should be doing more to help her, but I just don't have the time." It made me feel guilty and stressed out.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Marcus. I can understand how that thought would lead to feelings of guilt and stress. Let's examine this thought using the thought record. First, what emotions did you feel when you had that thought, and how intense were they on a scale of 0 to 100?

Patient: I felt a mix of guilt and stress, probably around 80 out of 100 for both. It was really overwhelming.

Therapist: Okay, so we have the situation: "Helping my mom with her rough day." The emotions: guilt and stress, at 80 intensity. Now, let's identify the evidence for and against the thought "I should be doing more to help her, but I just don't have the time." What evidence do you have that supports this thought?

Patient: Well, I see her struggling, and I know she needs more help than I can give right now. I also know that I have a lot of other responsibilities, like my job and my kids.

Therapist: And what evidence do you have against this thought?

Patient: I do what I can when I can. I visit her regularly, help with small tasks, and make sure she has what she needs. I also have a support system in place, like neighbors who check in on her when I can't be there.

Therapist: Great. Now, let's look at an alternative thought that takes into account the evidence for and against the original thought. What might be a more balanced way of looking at this situation?

Patient: Maybe instead of thinking I should be doing more, I could think, "I'm doing the best I can with the time and resources I have, and that's enough for now." It feels less overwhelming and more realistic.

Therapist: That's a fantastic alternative thought, Marcus. It acknowledges your efforts and the reality of your situation without adding extra pressure. Now, if you were to re-rate the intensity of your emotions with this new thought, how intense would they be?

Patient: I'd say the guilt and stress would drop to around 50 out of 100. It's still there, but it's not as crushing.

Therapist: That's a significant reduction in emotional intensity, Marcus. This is a great example of how reframing our thoughts can help shift our emotional response. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to catch and challenge those "should" statements in the moment.

Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about coping strategies for managing the stress of caregiving. One technique that can be helpful is called "radical acceptance." It involves accepting the reality of the situation, even if it's not what you want or expect, and letting go of the struggle against it. This doesn't mean giving up or approving of the situation, but rather acknowledging that it is what it is and focusing on what you can control. What are your thoughts on this concept?

Patient: Radical acceptance, huh? I get the idea, but it's tough to let go of the struggle. I feel like I'm always fighting against something, whether it's the system, my own limitations, or the challenges my students face. How do I start practicing this when it feels so counterintuitive?

Therapist: Radical acceptance is a skill that takes practice, and it can feel challenging at first, especially when we're used to fighting against things. One way to start is by setting small, achievable goals for yourself. When you notice yourself getting caught up in the struggle, take a step back and ask yourself, "What would be a small, realistic goal in this situation?"

For example, let's say you're struggling with getting your mom to accept help with her medication. A small goal might be to simply ask her if she'd like some help with her pills, without judging her response or trying to force her to do something she doesn't want to do. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds doable. I can try to focus on small steps instead of the whole overwhelming picture. It might help me feel less stuck and more in control.

Therapist: Exactly. And as you practice setting small goals and accepting the reality of the situation, you'll likely find that the struggle starts to fade. It's not about giving up, but rather about conserving your energy for what matters most.

Another helpful technique is called "self-compassion." This involves treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would extend to a good friend in a similar situation. Often, we can be very hard on ourselves, which only adds to the stress and anxiety. How do you think self-compassion might help you in your caregiving role?

Patient: Self-compassion would definitely help. Sometimes I get so caught up in all the things I'm not doing right that I forget to cut myself some slack. Like, I feel guilty for not being able to be there for my mom as much as I'd like, or for not being the perfect dad after the divorce. If I could just remind myself that it's okay to struggle, it might make things a bit easier to handle.

Therapist: You're absolutely right, Marcus. Self-compassion is a powerful tool for managing the emotional toll of caregiving. By treating yourself with kindness and understanding, you can start to ease the burden of perfectionism and unrealistic expectations.

One way to practice self-compassion is to imagine what you would say to a good friend in your situation. For example, let's say your friend was struggling with similar feelings of guilt and inadequacy related to their mother's care. What might you say to them to offer support and comfort?

Patient: I'd probably tell them, "You're doing the best you can, and that's enough. It's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. Your mom knows you love her, and you're doing everything you can to be there for her." It's simple, but it could really help someone feel less alone in their struggle.

Therapist: That's a great example of a self-compassionate statement. Now, try directing that same kindness and understanding back towards yourself. How does it feel to speak to yourself in that way?

Patient: It feels... different. I guess I'm not used to hearing those words from myself. But it does make me feel a bit lighter, like maybe I don't have to carry the weight of the world on my shoulders all the time.

Therapist: That's wonderful, Marcus. As you practice self-compassion more, you'll likely find that it becomes more natural and automatic. It's a way of building up your emotional resilience, so that you can better handle the challenges that come with caregiving.

Another helpful technique is called "worry time." This involves setting aside a specific time each day to focus on your worries and concerns, rather than letting them consume you throughout the day. During your designated worry time, you can write down your concerns, challenge them, and brainstorm solutions. The rest of the day, you practice letting those worries go until your next scheduled worry time. How do you think this technique might help you manage the stress of caregiving?

Patient: I appreciate the reminder about self-compassion. It's easy to forget to give myself that kindness, especially when I'm juggling so much. As for the "worry time" technique, it sounds like a practical way to manage stress. I often find myself ruminating late at night, which doesn't help anyone. Setting aside specific time to focus on worries and then letting them go the rest of the day might help me sleep better and conserve energy for the next day. I could try it out and see how it feels.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Marcus. Letting go of worries and ruminative thoughts can be challenging, but setting aside a dedicated "worry time" can help. As with any new skill, it might feel a bit uncomfortable at first, but with practice, it can become a valuable tool for managing stress.

Before we wrap up today's session, let's discuss some homework assignments. First, I'd like you to continue practicing the thought record, with a focus on reframing those "should" statements. Remember to look for evidence against the thoughts and develop more balanced alternative thoughts.

Second, I'd like you to try out the "worry time" technique. Set aside a specific time each day, maybe 15-20 minutes, and during that time, allow yourself to focus on worries and concerns. Write them down, challenge them, and brainstorm solutions. Then, practice letting those worries go until your next scheduled "worry time."

Lastly, I'd like you to practice radical acceptance. When you notice yourself getting caught up in the struggle or fighting against reality, take a step back and ask yourself, "What would be a small, realistic goal in this situation?" Then, focus on achieving that small goal, without judgment.

How do these homework assignments sound to you? Do you have any questions or concerns?

Patient: The homework assignments sound manageable. I'll definitely keep working on the thought record and try to catch those "should" statements. The "worry time" technique is something I'm eager to try, especially since I often find myself ruminating late at night. As for radical acceptance, I think setting small, realistic goals will help me feel less overwhelmed. I don't have any immediate concerns, but I'll let you know if anything comes up as I work on these assignments.

Therapist: That sounds great, Marcus. I'm confident that with practice, these techniques will become more natural and helpful for managing your emotional well-being. Remember, it's a process, and progress takes time. Be patient and compassionate with yourself, just as you would be with a good friend in your situation.

Before we end today's session, I'd like to do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now, and do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?

Patient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful, to be honest. It's nice to have some concrete strategies to try out. I think the "worry time" and radical acceptance will be particularly helpful. I'm also glad we're continuing with the thought records; they've been eye-opening so far. Thanks for the support, Nova. I'll see you next week.
