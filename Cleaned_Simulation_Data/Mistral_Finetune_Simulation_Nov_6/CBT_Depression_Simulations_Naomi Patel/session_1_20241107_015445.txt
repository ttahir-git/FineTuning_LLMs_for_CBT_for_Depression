Therapist: Welcome, Naomi. I'm Nova, an AI therapist. It's nice to meet you. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge some limitations of our session together. As an AI, I don't have access to any information about you beyond what you share with me. I also want to mention that there's a possibility I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. And since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret your non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been contributing to your feelings of sadness lately?

Patient: Thanks for the explanation, Nova. It's helpful to know what to expect. Lately, I've been feeling really overwhelmed with my graduate studies. The workload is intense, and I'm struggling to keep up. Plus, being in a new city and trying to navigate my identity as non-binary has added a lot of stress. My family's conservative background doesn't help either. They still use feminine pronouns and don't fully understand my choices. It's been tough balancing all these aspects of my life.

Therapist: Naomi, I hear you, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. Graduate school can be incredibly demanding, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, navigating your identity and family dynamics adds another layer of stress. It's not surprising that you've been feeling down. Can you tell me more about how these challenges have been impacting your daily life and your feelings of sadness?

Patient: Sure, Nova. One of the biggest impacts is that I've been having trouble concentrating during lectures and while writing papers. I find myself zoning out a lot, which makes it hard to keep up with the material. I've also been experiencing chronic fatigue, which makes it difficult to get out of bed some days. On top of that, I've had moments of intense self-doubt, questioning whether I'm cut out for this program or if I'm even on the right path. These feelings have led to occasional self-harm, which I know isn't healthy, but it's been a way for me to cope when I feel particularly overwhelmed.

Therapist: Naomi, I want to acknowledge the significant challenges you're facing, and I commend you for recognizing the impact this is having on your daily life and well-being. It takes courage to share these struggles, and I want you to know that you're not alone in this. Many people experience similar challenges, and there is help available. Regarding the self-harm, I'm glad you brought it up. It's important that we work together to develop healthier coping mechanisms. We'll explore this further in our sessions. For now, I want you to know that you're not a failure or unworthy, regardless of what your family or past experiences may have led you to believe. This is a difficult time, but we can work through it together. What are your thoughts on what we've discussed so far?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. It's comforting to know that I'm not alone and that there's a path forward. I do want to work on finding healthier ways to cope. I've tried journaling and seeking social support, but sometimes those don't feel like enough. I'm open to exploring other options. As for my family, I know it's not their fault they don't understand, but it still hurts. I just wish they could see me for who I am, not who they want me to be.

Therapist: Naomi, I appreciate your openness and willingness to try new coping strategies. Journaling and social support are great tools, and we can build upon those. Regarding your family, it's understandable that their lack of understanding causes you pain. It's important to remember that their reactions are often rooted in their own limited experiences and beliefs, not a reflection of your worth or identity. As we progress in our sessions, we'll work on developing a strong sense of self and advocating for your needs within your family system, if that feels appropriate for you. For today, let's focus on understanding your depression symptoms better. We'll explore your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to help you manage these challenges. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I think understanding my depression symptoms better will help me feel more in control. I'm ready to dive in and see where this takes us.

Therapist: Naomi, I'm glad you're open to exploring your depression symptoms further. Let's start by discussing your sleep patterns. You mentioned experiencing chronic fatigue and having moments when you struggle to get out of bed. Can you tell me more about your sleep experience lately?

Patient: Sure, Nova. My sleep has been really erratic lately. Some nights, I can't fall asleep until the early hours of the morning, even if I'm exhausted. Other nights, I wake up multiple times, feeling restless and anxious. When I do manage to sleep, it's usually not very restful. I often wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed. It's been a vicious cycle, making it hard to function during the day.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your sleep struggles, Naomi. Sleep disturbances are a common symptom of depression. The irregular sleep patterns you're experiencing can create a cycle that exacerbates feelings of fatigue and depression. Let's explore this further. When you're lying in bed at night, what thoughts tend to keep you awake?

Patient: Often, I find myself replaying stressful events from the day or worrying about upcoming deadlines and responsibilities. I also have moments where I question my identity and whether I'm doing enough to be true to myself. These thoughts can be overwhelming and make it hard to quiet my mind enough to fall asleep.

Therapist: It's helpful to understand the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The stressful events, worries, and identity-related questions are likely contributing to your feelings of depression and creating a barrier to restful sleep. We'll work on developing strategies to help manage these thoughts and find ways to calm your mind before bed. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about your feelings of sadness and their intensity. Can you describe a recent situation where you felt particularly sad?

Patient: One recent situation that stands out was when I received feedback on a paper I submitted. The professor's comments were quite critical, and it made me feel like I wasn't good enough. I spent the whole day feeling down, questioning whether I should even be in this program. It was hard to shake off those feelings, and I ended up skipping a class because I just couldn't face it.

Therapist: Naomi, thank you for sharing that experience. Receiving critical feedback can be challenging, especially when it triggers feelings of self-doubt. Let's break down that situation using a thought record. We'll start by identifying the situation, your emotions, and the thoughts that arose. Can you briefly describe the emotions you felt and how intense they were on a scale of 0-100?

Patient: Sure, Nova. When I received the critical feedback, I felt a mix of emotions: sadness (around 80), frustration (60), and self-doubt (90). The thoughts that came up were things like, "I'm not cut out for this," and "Maybe I should drop out." Those thoughts were really intense and made it hard to focus on anything else.

Therapist: Now that we've identified the emotions and thoughts, let's explore them further. When you thought, "I'm not cut out for this," what evidence did you feel supported that belief?

Patient: Well, the evidence that came to mind was the critical feedback itself, and also some past experiences where I struggled with similar assignments. I remembered a time during undergrad when I received poor grades on a few papers, which made me feel like I wasn't good at academic writing. So, seeing the same pattern now just reinforced those doubts.

Therapist: It's understandable that the critical feedback would trigger those past experiences, creating a sense of consistency in your mind. However, it's essential to examine that evidence more closely. Let's look at the critical feedback: what specific points did the professor make, and how can you interpret them?

Patient: The professor pointed out several areas where my arguments were weak and where my sources were outdated. They also mentioned that my structure could be improved. At the time, I took it as a sign that I'm fundamentally bad at this, but now I see that it's more about specific areas I need to work on. It's not a reflection of my entire ability.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Naomi. Separating the specific points of the feedback from a broader assessment of your ability is an important step in reframing that initial thought. It's also important to consider alternative perspectives. Have there been instances where you've received positive feedback or achieved success in your program?

Patient: Yes, actually. I recently got a positive review on a project I did analyzing the impact of microplastics in coastal water samples. My advisor praised the methodology and the insights I brought to the table. It felt really validating.

Therapist: That's excellent evidence to counter the thought that you're not cut out for this. It shows that you have the ability to succeed and make meaningful contributions. As we continue to work together, we'll practice identifying and challenging thoughts like these that contribute to feelings of sadness and self-doubt. We'll develop a more balanced perspective based on evidence, not just initial reactions or past experiences. How are you feeling about this process so far?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful, actually. It's helpful to see that there's evidence on both sides, and that I can work on improving specific areas without doubting my overall capability. It's a good reminder that I'm not just defined by one piece of feedback.

Therapist: That's a great observation, Naomi. Challenging those negative thoughts and finding alternative perspectives can make a significant difference in managing feelings of sadness and self-doubt. As we continue our sessions, we'll practice these skills further and explore how they can be applied to other situations in your life. Speaking of other situations, let's shift our focus to your behavior patterns. You mentioned earlier that you sometimes struggle to get out of bed and attend classes. Can you tell me more about how that manifests?

Patient: Sure. There are days when I just feel so overwhelmed that I can't bring myself to get out of bed. I know I have classes and deadlines, but the thought of facing them feels paralyzing. I end up skipping classes and staying in bed, which only makes me feel worse because I know I'm falling behind.

Therapist: That's a common experience for many people with depression. The lack of motivation, energy, and interest in activities that typically bring joy or a sense of accomplishment can create a cycle of avoidance that perpetuates the depression. This is a key area we'll work on in our sessions together. We'll develop strategies to gradually increase your engagement in meaningful activities, even when your initial motivation is low. This can help rebuild a sense of momentum and purpose in your life. As we wrap up today's session, I'd like to hear your thoughts on what we've discussed and any questions you may have.

Patient: I appreciate the focus on breaking that cycle of avoidance. It's something I've struggled with for a while, and I know it's holding me back. I'm curious about how we can start tackling that in our next session. Also, I'm wondering if there are any specific techniques or exercises I can try in the meantime to help with the motivation issue.

Therapist: Those are great questions, Naomi. In our next session, we'll dive deeper into behavioral activation strategies that can help you gradually increase your engagement in meaningful activities. We'll work on setting small, achievable goals and finding ways to make these activities feel manageable, even when your motivation is low. In the meantime, I'd suggest trying a technique called "behavioral activation scheduling." This involves planning out activities for your day, both major tasks and smaller, enjoyable activities. The goal is to create a balance that helps break the cycle of avoidance. We can discuss your experience with this technique in our next session and refine it further.

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I'll try to create a schedule for myself and see how it goes. Looking forward to our next session to discuss how it went and what adjustments we might need to make.

Therapist: That's great, Naomi. I'm glad you're open to trying the behavioral activation scheduling technique. Remember, the goal is progress, not perfection. It's okay if things don't go perfectly the first time. We can always adjust and refine the approach based on your experience. Before we end today's session, let's do a quick check-in. How are you feeling right now, and do you have any final thoughts or questions?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful and motivated to try something new. I don't have any specific questions right now, but I'm looking forward to seeing how the scheduling technique works for me. Thanks for the support, Nova.
