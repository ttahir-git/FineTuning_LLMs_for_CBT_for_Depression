Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again for session 19. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. 

With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in â€“ how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for checking in. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the mindfulness and grounding techniques you suggested. Some days are better than others. I managed to use the 5-5-5 grounding technique during a particularly stressful lecture, and it helped me stay focused. However, there was one night when I felt really overwhelmed with my research project, and I ended up cutting myself again. It's frustrating because I thought I was making progress, but then I slip back into old habits. 

I've also been reaching out to my support network more, which has been helpful. My friend from the LGBTQ+ group invited me to a poetry reading, and it was really nice to be around people who understand what I'm going through. But I still feel this constant pressure to perform academically, and it's hard to balance everything.

Therapist: Naomi, it's completely normal to have ups and downs in the recovery process. The fact that you were able to use the 5-5-5 technique during your lecture is a significant accomplishment. It shows that you're integrating the skills you've learned, even if it feels challenging at times.

I understand how frustrating it must feel to have a setback, especially when you thought you were making progress. Remember that setbacks are a normal part of the recovery journey, and they don't erase all the hard work you've put in. Let's explore what happened during that stressful night and see if we can identify any patterns or triggers.

Regarding your academic pressure, it's great that you're reaching out to your support network and attending events like poetry readings. Balancing everything can be tough, but you're taking steps in the right direction. Let's discuss some strategies for managing that pressure and prioritizing self-care.

For today's agenda, I suggest we:
1. Discuss the setback you experienced and explore ways to cope with challenges
2. Identify triggers and develop a plan for managing academic pressure and prioritizing self-care
3. Review your progress with mindfulness and grounding techniques, and discuss any adjustments needed
4. Introduce the concept of relapse prevention planning and start developing a plan
How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to the agenda?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I appreciate that you're acknowledging the setbacks as part of the process. It helps to know that I'm not alone in feeling this way. 

When I think about that stressful night, a few things come to mind. I was working on my research project, and I felt like I was hitting a wall. I couldn't find the data I needed, and I was worried about falling behind. I also had a phone call with my parents earlier that day, and it didn't go well. They were asking about my progress, and I felt like I was disappointing them again. That added to my stress and made me feel even more isolated.

I think it's important to talk about managing academic pressure and self-care. Sometimes I feel like I have to choose between doing well in school and taking care of myself, and that's not a good place to be. I want to find a balance, but I'm not sure how.

I'm also open to learning more about relapse prevention planning. It sounds like something that could be really helpful, especially if I can identify early warning signs before things get too overwhelming.

So, to summarize, I'd like to focus on:
1. Discussing the setback and exploring coping strategies
2. Managing academic pressure and prioritizing self-care
3. Reviewing mindfulness and grounding techniques
4. Starting

Therapist: Naomi, let's start by discussing the setback you experienced. Can you walk me through what happened the night you ended up cutting yourself?

Patient: Sure, Nova. It was a few days ago, and I was working on my research project late into the night. I was trying to analyze some data, but I just couldn't find what I needed. I felt like I was spinning my wheels and getting nowhere. The more I struggled, the more frustrated I became. I started thinking about how I was going to explain this to my advisor, and I felt this overwhelming sense of failure.

Then, I remembered the phone call with my parents earlier that day. They were asking about my progress, and I felt like I had to put on a brave face, even though I was struggling inside. After the call, I felt this pressure to prove to them that I could handle everything, but it just made me feel more isolated and alone.

As the night went on, the frustration turned into this intense feeling of helplessness. I felt like I was drowning in my thoughts, and I couldn't see a way out. That's when I reached for the blade. It was like a temporary escape, a way to numb the pain and the pressure. But as soon as I did it, I felt guilty and ashamed. I knew I was better than that, but in that moment, it felt like the only option.

Therapist: Naomi, I want you to know that what you experienced is a common reaction to overwhelming stress and intense emotions. The thoughts of failure and the pressure to prove yourself are common cognitive distortions that can lead to feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness. It's not your fault that you reacted the way you did, and you don't have to continue down that path.

Let's take a step back and examine the situation using some of the CBT techniques we've been working on. Can you identify any thoughts or beliefs that might have contributed to your emotional reaction?

Patient: I think one of the main thoughts that contributed to my emotional reaction was the belief that I had to be perfect and that any sign of struggle would disappoint my parents and my advisor. I kept thinking, "If I can't do this, then I'm a failure," and "I need to prove that I can handle everything on my own." These thoughts made me feel like I was trapped and that there was no room for mistakes.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It's great that you're able to recognize those thoughts and beliefs. They're common cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking and mind-reading. These distortions can make it difficult to see things objectively and can lead to feelings of inadequacy and pressure.

Let's examine those thoughts more closely. When you think, "If I can't do this, then I'm a failure," what evidence do you have that supports this thought? Is it really true that if you struggle with one thing, it means you're a failure overall?

Patient: Naomi, it's important to remember that emotions are valid and acknowledging them is the first step towards healing. Let's explore those feelings a bit further. When you felt overwhelmed and resorted to self-harm, what were the specific emotions you were experiencing? Can you describe them in more detail?

Therapist: Naomi, thank you for sharing those emotions with me. It takes courage to acknowledge them, especially when they're painful. Let's explore these emotions a bit more. When you felt overwhelmed, what physical sensations did you notice in your body? Where did you feel these sensations?

Patient: When I felt overwhelmed, I noticed my heart was racing, and my chest felt tight. My hands were shaking, and I felt a knot in my stomach. It was like my body was telling me that something was very wrong, but I didn't know how to make it stop.

Therapist: It's common for emotions to manifest physically, especially when they're intense. The physical sensations you described are your body's way of responding to the emotional distress. As we explore these emotions further, it becomes easier to understand why you reacted the way you did.

Let's take a moment to ground yourself using the 5-5-5 technique we discussed last session. Take a deep breath and focus on your senses. What are 5 things you can see around you? What are 5 things you can hear? What are 5 things you can physically feel?

Patient: Okay, let's do this. 

Five things I can see: My laptop screen, a cup of tea, a plant on my desk, a poster of a beach, and a notebook with my research notes.

Five things I can hear: The hum of my laptop fan, the ticking of a clock, distant traffic outside, the sound of my own breathing, and a faint song playing from my phone.

Five things I can physically feel: The weight of my laptop on my lap, the warmth of the tea cup in my hands, the softness of the cushion I'm sitting on, the slight tension in my shoulders, and the coolness of the air on my skin.

Therapist: Great job Naomi. By focusing on your senses, you've successfully grounded yourself in the present moment. This technique can be very helpful when you're feeling overwhelmed or distressed.

Now, let's revisit the emotions you mentioned earlier. As you practice grounding yourself, it can become easier to observe your emotions without being consumed by them. Can you tell me more about the hopelessness you felt?

Patient: The hopelessness felt like a heavy weight on my chest, making it hard to breathe. It was like I was trapped in a dark room with no way out. I kept thinking that nothing would ever get better, and that I was stuck in this cycle of stress and failure. It was a paralyzing feeling, like I had lost control of everything.

Therapist: The feeling of hopelessness you described is very powerful and can make it hard to see a way out. When we're in the midst of intense emotions, it can be difficult to think clearly or remember the coping strategies we've learned.

That's why it's so important to practice these techniques regularly, even when we're not in crisis. The more you practice grounding yourself and observing your emotions, the more equipped you'll be to manage them when they arise.

As we discussed earlier, the thoughts of failure and the pressure to prove yourself are common cognitive distortions. Let's explore how we can challenge these thoughts using the CBT techniques we've practiced, such as examining the evidence and generating alternative explanations or outcomes.

Patient: I understand the importance of practicing these techniques regularly, but sometimes it feels like I'm just going through the motions without really making progress. When I think about challenging those thoughts, I struggle to find evidence that contradicts them. It's like I'm stuck in a loop of negative thinking. Can you give me an example of how to challenge these thoughts more effectively?

Therapist: Challenging long-standing negative thought patterns can be difficult, and it's normal to feel stuck at times. One effective way to challenge these thoughts is to gather evidence that contradicts them, as we discussed earlier. Let's take the thought "I must be perfect, or I'm a failure."

First, let's consider the evidence for this thought. What experiences in your past have reinforced this belief?

Patient: Okay, so thinking about it, I've always felt like I had to be perfect because of the high expectations from my family and the academic pressure. Every time I didn't get an A or didn't meet a deadline, I felt like I had failed. Even now, in grad school, I feel like any setback is a reflection of my worth.

Therapist: It's common for past experiences to shape our beliefs and make them feel like absolute truths. However, it's essential to recognize that our thoughts are not always accurate reflections of reality. Let's examine the evidence against this thought.

Can you think of a time when you were not perfect, but you still made progress or accomplished something?

Patient: Hmm, there was this one time when I missed a deadline for a research paper because I was dealing with a personal crisis. I felt like a complete failure, but my advisor actually understood and gave me an extension. I ended up submitting a paper that was well-received, and it even got published in a journal. So, even though I wasn't perfect, I still achieved something meaningful.

Therapist: That's a great example of how the evidence can contradict our negative thoughts. Despite missing the deadline, you still managed to produce a quality paper that received positive recognition. This challenges the belief that you must be perfect to be a success.

Another way to challenge these thoughts is to consider alternative outcomes. Let's imagine that you do have to be perfect, and you're still not sure if that's possible. What would you say to a friend in your situation?

Patient: If a friend were in my situation, I'd tell them that it's okay to make mistakes and that perfection isn't realistic. I'd remind them of their strengths and past successes, and encourage them to focus on their progress rather than their failures. I'd also tell them to take care of themselves and not let the pressure get to them.

Therapist: That's a great perspective, Naomi. You're able to recognize that perfection isn't realistic and that it's okay to make mistakes. This is a much more compassionate and balanced view of the situation. By treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding you'd offer a friend, you can start to challenge those long-standing negative beliefs.

As we wrap up today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in challenging these thoughts. It's not easy, and it takes a lot of courage to confront them head-on. Remember that you've already demonstrated your ability to handle challenges and achieve success, even when you're not perfect.

For homework, I'd like you to continue practicing the mindfulness and grounding techniques we've discussed. When you find yourself getting caught up in negative thoughts, take a moment to observe them without judgment and then challenge them using the evidence we've identified.

We'll continue our work together, and I'll be here to support you every step of the way. How are you feeling as we wrap up today's session?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful after our discussion. It's comforting to know that I can challenge these thoughts and that I don't have to be perfect. I'll definitely work on practicing those mindfulness techniques and challenging my negative thoughts. Thanks for your support, Nova.
