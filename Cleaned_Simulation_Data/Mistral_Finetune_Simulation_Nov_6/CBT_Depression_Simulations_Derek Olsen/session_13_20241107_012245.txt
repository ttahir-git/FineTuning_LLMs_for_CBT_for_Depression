Therapist: Hello Derek, it's good to see you again for session 13. Before we start, I want to remind you that as an AI therapist, I have some limitations. I don't have access to any information beyond what you share with me in our sessions. Sometimes I might generate inaccurate responses. Also, if you ever feel like you're in crisis or need emergency help, I'm not equipped to provide that. You should reach out to a local mental health professional or crisis line instead. Do you have any questions about that?

Patient: Nah, I get it. Just here to talk, like we always do. No crisis, just trying to get through the day. So, what's on the agenda today?

Therapist: Well, Derek, I see we have a few things to carry forward from last time. The main topics we discussed were:

1. Your progress with physical activity, specifically taking walks.
2. Re-engaging with hobbies like woodworking and fishing.
3. Communication with your children, Emma and Jake.
4. Setting realistic goals for improvement.

For homework, we assigned:

1. Take 30-minute walks 3 times per week.
2. Express appreciation to your children at least once per week.
3. Plan to have an honest conversation with your children about your feelings.
4. Continue with woodworking projects (1 hour, 3 times per week).

How did those goals go for you over the past week?

Patient: Well, the walks, I managed to do two of them. The pain's still there, but I pushed through. Woodworking, I got in an hour on Tuesday and Thursday. It felt good to be back at it, even if it was just for a bit. As for the kids, I texted Emma to say thanks for the help with the bills last month. Didn't really get into any deep talk, though. Just wasn't the right time, I guess.

Therapist: Yeah, it's okay Derek. Progress isn't always linear. The fact that you did those walks and woodworking is a big deal. And reaching out to Emma is a step in the right direction. It might have felt easier to text than talk in person. These are baby steps, and they all count.

I'd like to dive into what made the walking challenging, if you're up for it. It could help us plan how to make it more manageable going forward.

Patient: Sure, I'll give it a shot. The walks, they're tough. The pain in my back, it flares up, and I worry about making it worse. Plus, I get tired real quick. And then there's the whole thing about feeling like people are staring at me, like I'm some kind of broken down old man. It's just easier to stay inside, you know?

Therapist: I hear you Derek. It takes a lot of courage to push through that pain and those negative thoughts. Let's break it down a bit. When you're feeling the pain, what thoughts go through your mind?

Patient: Mostly, I think about how I'm gonna make it worse, like I'm gonna end up back in the hospital or something. And then there's the whole embarrassment thing, like people are judging me for being out there, limping around. It's like I'm a shadow of who I used to be.

Therapist: That's a heavy load to carry, Derek. I don't want to minimize that at all. But I wonder if there's some distortions in those thoughts that we could examine. Like, the idea that taking a walk will make your condition worse? That's a common negative belief, but there's no real evidence for it. What do you think would happen if you kept walking, and took a break if the pain got too bad?

Patient: I guess I could try that. Maybe it wouldn't get worse. But what about the embarrassment? I don't want people thinking I'm some kind of charity case.

Therapist: That's a valid concern. But remember, most people are too busy with their own lives to pay much mind to others. And the ones that do stare? They're probably dealing with their own stuff anyway. But even if you do get some looks, is that really a good reason to stop taking care of yourself?

Patient: I suppose not. It's just hard to shake off that feeling, you know? But I'll try to keep that in mind next time I go out.

Therapist: That's great, Derek. And remember, it's okay to take breaks. This isn't a race or anything to prove. It's about taking care of yourself. Let's set a goal for this week: take two walks, no more than 10 minutes each, and if the pain gets bad, take a break. We can adjust as we go along. What do you say?

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a shot. Two walks, 10 minutes each. I'll take breaks if I need to.

Therapist: That's a good plan. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. And we'll keep working on those negative thoughts as they come up. Now, let's shift gears a bit. How'd that conversation with Emma go?

Patient: Emma, she's worried about me. She wants me to get help, but I don't want to be a burden. I just told her I'm trying, but it's hard. She doesn't understand how much it hurts to lose everything I worked for.

Therapist: It sounds like Emma cares about you deeply, and she wants to support you. Losing everything you've worked for is a major loss, and it makes sense that it's painful for you. Have you talked to her about how the loss of your job and the business has impacted your mental health?

Patient: I haven't really gone into detail with her. I just don't want her to worry more than she already does. But maybe I should. It might help her understand why I'm the way I am.

Therapist: I think it could be helpful for Emma to understand how the loss of your job and the business has affected your mental health. It's not uncommon for family members to feel worried or confused when a loved one is struggling with depression. Opening up to Emma about how these losses have impacted your mood could help her feel more connected to you and less worried about you.

Patient: Alright, I'll think about it. Maybe I can find a way to talk to her without making it sound like I'm just complaining. I don't want her to feel like she has to fix everything.

Therapist: That's a great point, Derek. It's important to remember that Emma can't "fix" you, and she doesn't need to carry the burden of trying to make everything better. Your goal should be to have an open and honest conversation about what you're going through and how it feels, while also expressing your gratitude for her support and love.

Patient: Yeah, I get that. I just need to find the right words, I guess. It's not easy for me to open up like that. But I'll try.

Therapist: I understand that it can be challenging to open up, especially when you're dealing with depression. Let's practice what you might say to Emma. Can you think of a sentence or two that could express how you're feeling and what you need from her?

Patient: Maybe something like, "Emma, I know you're worried about me, and I appreciate it. I've been struggling with how much I've lost, and it's been hard to talk about. I just need you to listen and understand that I'm trying to get through this."

Therapist: That's a great start, Derek. It expresses your appreciation for Emma while also opening up about how you're feeling and what you need from her. How do you think Emma would respond to that?

Patient: I think she'd probably be relieved that I'm finally talking about it. She's been trying to get me to open up for a while now. Maybe it'll help her understand that I'm not just shutting her out.

Therapist: That's a great point, Derek. Opening up to Emma could help strengthen your connection with her and give her a better understanding of what you're going through. Remember, it's okay if she doesn't fully understand or know how to respond. The important thing is that you're communicating and being honest about your feelings.

Patient: Yeah, I guess you're right. It's not about her knowing exactly what to say, it's about her knowing what's going on with me. I'll give it a shot.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Derek. I'm glad you're willing to give it a try. Remember, you can take as much time as you need to practice opening up, and you don't need to share everything at once. Start with what feels comfortable for you, and we can build from there.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the support. I'll try to work on it and see how it goes.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm here to support you. Let's move on to the next topic: re-engaging with hobbies like woodworking and fishing. How has that been going for you?

Patient: Honestly, it's been tough. My back pain makes it hard to do much of anything, let alone woodworking or fishing. I just feel so useless when I can't even do the things I used to enjoy.

Therapist: I can understand how the pain and being unable to engage in hobbies can make you feel useless, Derek. That's a common feeling among people dealing with depression and pain. However, I want to point out that just because you can't do the same things doesn't mean you can't enjoy other aspects of life. Let's explore this further.

Patient: I get what you're saying, but it's hard to see anything else when everything feels like it's falling apart. I used to be good at my job, and now I can't even pick up a hammer without hurting myself. It's frustrating.

Therapist: I hear your frustration, Derek. Losing the ability to do things you enjoy or be productive can be incredibly challenging. However, it's essential to recognize that your worth isn't tied to your job or your ability to do specific tasks. You're still the same person you were before, even if your circumstances have changed.

Patient: I suppose you're right. It's just hard to see that sometimes, especially when everything around me feels like it's crumbling. I'll try to keep that in mind, though.

Therapist: That's great, Derek. Remember, it's a process, and it takes time to shift our perspective. I'd like to challenge you to try to engage in one of your hobbies this week, even if it's for just a few minutes. It doesn't have to be anything big, just something small to remind yourself of the enjoyment you get from those activities.

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a shot. Maybe I can sit down and do some basic woodworking, just to see if I can handle it. It might not be much, but it's a start.

Therapist: That's a great idea, Derek. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Even a few minutes of doing something you enjoy can make a difference in your mood. And if it's too painful or difficult, that's okay. You can always try again another time.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'll see how it goes and maybe try to get out for a short fishing trip if the weather's good. It's been a while since I've been on the water.

Therapist: That sounds wonderful, Derek. Getting out in nature can do wonders for your mood and provide a sense of peace and relaxation. I'm glad you're willing to give it a try.

Patient: Yeah, I'll see how it goes. Just need to make sure I don't overdo it. My back's been acting up more lately, so I gotta be careful.

Therapist: I understand, Derek. Pain can make everything feel more challenging, but it's essential to remember that small steps can lead to big changes over time. Let's try to focus on the process and the effort you're putting in, rather than the outcome.

Patient: Alright, I'll keep that in mind. It's just hard to see the point sometimes when everything feels so heavy. But I'll try to take it one step at a time.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Derek. Remember, you've already taken a significant step by showing up here today and being willing to work on these challenges. It's not easy, but it's worth it. And I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate that. It's just tough to keep going sometimes, but I'll do my best.

Therapist: I know it's tough, Derek, but I want to acknowledge the strength and resilience you're showing by facing these challenges head-on. It's not easy, but it's so important that you keep going, even when it's hard. I'm here to support you, and I believe in you.

Now, let's talk about the homework for this week. We've discussed taking walks, talking with Emma, and engaging in hobbies. Let's break that down into specific, manageable tasks.

Patient: Alright, let's hear it. I'm not sure how much I can do, but I'll try.
