Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again for our 16th session. I appreciate you sharing the summary from our last session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a crisis or need immediate assistance, please reach out to a local mental health professional or emergency services. Lastly, since our interaction is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues like facial expressions or body language. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Yeah, I've been alright, I guess. Still dealing with the same old stuffâ€”pain, not much to do, feeling like I'm just a burden. Tried to reach out to Emma a bit, but it's tough. She's busy with her own life, and I don't want to be a bother. How about you? Anything new on your end?

Therapist: It's been a while since we last spoke, and I can understand how the daily struggles can weigh you down. I appreciate your honesty about your experiences. Regarding Emma, I hear your concerns about not wanting to be a burden. This is something we can definitely explore further in our session today. Before we do that, let's take a moment to set an agenda for our time together. What would you like to prioritize in our session today?

Patient: Well, I guess I'd like to talk more about how to handle these negative thoughts, especially the ones about being a burden. It's been gnawing at me, and I'm not sure how to shake it off. Also, maybe something about how to keep trying with Emma without feeling like I'm pushing too hard. That's been a real struggle for me.

Therapist: Those are both important topics, and I'm glad you brought them up. Let's focus on addressing the negative thoughts first, and then we can shift our attention to your relationship with Emma. We can start by reviewing some of the homework you've been working on since our last session. How has it been going with challenging those negative thoughts, particularly the "I'm a burden" belief?

Patient: It's been tough. I try to remind myself of the times when I've been helpful, like when I gave advice to a neighbor about fixing something. But then I think about all the times I couldn't do anything, and it just feels like a drop in the ocean. I don't know if I'm really making any progress.

Therapist: I can understand how challenging it can be to shift those deeply ingrained negative beliefs. It's a process, and it takes time. The fact that you're recognizing your helpful moments, even if they feel small, is a significant step. Let's look at a specific situation from the past week when you felt like a burden. Can you walk me through what happened?

Patient: Alright, so last week, I was trying to fix a leaky faucet in my apartment. I've always been good with my hands, you know, but with this back, it's just not the same. Anyway, I called Emma, asked her if she knew anyone who could help. She came over herself to take a look at it. 

Now, instead of helping, I ended up just sitting on the couch while she worked. I felt like I was just in her way, or worse, like I was ruining her day or something. It made me feel like a burden because she was busy, and here she was, taking time out to help me. I just kept thinking, "Why am I so useless now?"

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Derek. I can see how that experience would bring up feelings of being a burden. Let's explore this further. When you were sitting on the couch, watching Emma work, what was going through your mind? What emotions were you feeling in that moment?

Patient: I was feeling pretty useless, like I should have been able to handle it myself. I was also feeling guilty, like I was taking up her time and energy. And then there was this anger, not at her, but at myself, for not being able to do what I used to do. It's like I was just a spectator in my own life.

Therapist: I can hear how painful and frustrating that experience must have been for you. Let's break this down a bit. When you say you were feeling "useless," what thoughts were going through your mind at that time?

Patient: I was thinking about how I used to be able to fix anything, how I was the one people came to for help. Now, I can't even fix a simple faucet without needing someone else to do it. It's like I'm not the man I used to be, and that's hard to swallow. I keep thinking, "What good am I now?"

Therapist: I hear how much this change in your abilities is impacting your sense of self-worth. Let's look at the evidence for and against the thought "What good am I now?" We can start by examining the evidence that supports this thought. What comes to mind?

Patient: Well, like I said, I couldn't fix the faucet. I can't do a lot of the things I used to do, like woodworking or even fishing. I can't work, so I'm not bringing in any money. And I feel like I'm just a drain on everyone around me, especially Emma.

Therapist: I understand how these experiences make you feel like you're not the man you used to be. However, I want to point out that there is evidence on the other side, too. Can you think of any examples of times when you have felt useful or valued, even with your current circumstances?

Patient: I guess there was that time I helped Jake with some advice on a job interview. He got the job, and he said my tips really helped. But that's just words, you know? It doesn't feel like much compared to what I used to do.

Therapist: I hear you, and I understand how it can feel like individual instances aren't enough to counter the bigger picture. However, I would like to suggest that every instance that shows your value and usefulness matters, even if they seem small. Let's look at it this way: if you were a friend of yours in a similar situation, would you dismiss their value based on their limitations, or would you see the evidence that they are still capable and valuable?

Patient: I guess I'd try to see the good in them, but it's hard to do that for myself. I keep thinking about how I used to be the strong one, the one who could handle anything. Now, I feel like I'm just a shadow of that.

Therapist: It's very common for people to be harder on themselves than they would be on others. Part of what we work on in CBT is developing that same self-compassion. I want to propose an exercise we can do together to help shift your perspective on this. Would you be willing to try it with me now?

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a shot. What do you have in mind?

Therapist: Let's start by imagining a close friend who is in a similar situation to you. They're dealing with chronic pain, have to retire early from work, and are struggling to find a sense of purpose and identity. What would you say to your friend if they expressed feeling useless and like a burden?

Patient: I'd tell them that they're still important, that they've got a lot of life experience and wisdom to share. I'd remind them of the little things they do that make a difference, like helping out with advice or just being there to listen. I'd say they're not a burden, and that they still have a lot to offer.

Therapist: That's a great perspective, Derek. Now, I want you to try to apply that same compassion and understanding to yourself. When you catch yourself thinking "I'm useless" or "I'm a burden," I want you to challenge those thoughts and remind yourself of the evidence that contradicts them. You're still important, you still have value, and you still have something to contribute. It might feel hard at first, but with practice, it will get easier to be kind to yourself, just like you would be to a friend.

Patient: I'll try, but it's not easy. I've been beating myself up for so long, it's hard to switch gears. But I'll give it a shot. Maybe I can start by reminding myself of the times I've helped Jake or Emma, even if it's just with advice.

Therapist: That's a great idea. And remember, it's not about being perfect or getting rid of these thoughts altogether. It's about learning to recognize them and challenge them, and that's something you can do one step at a time. I'm here to support you through that process.

Before we move on to discussing your relationship with Emma, I want to check in with you. How are you feeling after doing this exercise?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful, I guess. It's still tough, but maybe there's a way to start seeing myself differently. I'll keep trying, at least.

Therapist: That's wonderful to hear, Derek. I'm glad you're feeling a bit more hopeful. Remember, change is a process, and it takes time. Be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories along the way.

Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about your relationship with Emma. You mentioned earlier that you've been trying to reach out to her but it's been challenging. Can you tell me more about what's been going on there?

Patient: Well, Emma's been busy with her own life, and I don't want to be a bother. I know I've missed a lot of child support payments, and that's not sitting well with her. I try to call, but I can hear the tension in her voice, and it just makes me feel worse. I don't know how to fix it.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a lot going on between you and Emma, and it's understandably causing you a lot of stress. I want to explore this further and see if we can find ways to help you communicate more effectively and manage the tension between you.

Before we do that, I want to check in with you about my suggestion about challenging your negative thoughts. I know we talked about doing that on your own, but I'm wondering if it might be helpful for you to practice doing it together with me. What do you think about that?

Patient: I guess it couldn't hurt. I'm not great at this kind of stuff, so having someone to walk me through it might help. What do you have in mind?

Therapist: I'm glad you're open to trying that. It can be really helpful to have a guide when we're working on challenging negative thoughts. Let's pick a specific situation from the past week where you found yourself feeling like a burden, and we'll work through the process together.

Can you think of a specific situation where you felt that way?

Patient: Yeah, there was this one time when I tried to help Jake with some car trouble. He was polite, but I could tell he was frustrated. I felt like I was just getting in the way, like I wasn't any help at all.

Therapist: Okay, let's use that situation. The first step is to identify the negative thought that was going through your mind in that moment. Can you remember what you were telling yourself?

Patient: I was thinking, "I'm just a burden. I can't do anything right. I'm just making things worse for him."

Therapist: That's a good start. We've identified the thought. Now, let's look for evidence for and against that thought. What evidence do you have that you were, in fact, a burden in that situation?

Patient: Well, Jake seemed a bit tense, and I didn't really know how to fix the car. I just watched him work, feeling useless.

Therapist: Okay, so there's some evidence that supports the thought. Now, let's look for evidence against the thought. Is it possible that Jake didn't need help at all, but was just polite?

Patient: Maybe. He did say he appreciated me being there, even if I couldn't do much. But it still felt like I was just in the way.

Therapist: I can see why it would feel that way. Let's look for one more piece of evidence against the thought. Have there been other times when you've felt like you've been helpful, even if it wasn't with physical labor?

Patient: Hmm, I guess when I helped Emma with her kids, even if it was just watching them so she could rest. She seemed grateful, but I still felt like I wasn't doing enough.

Therapist: That's a good point. It's not always about the big physical tasks. Being there for people, showing up, that's important too. I know it's hard, but I'm trying to help you see that you do have value, even if it's not in the same way you're used to.

What do you think, can you challenge that negative thought, based on the evidence we've gathered?

Patient: I guess I can see that I'm not totally useless. But it's still hard to shake the feeling that I should be doing more.

Therapist: That's understandable. These thoughts are deep-seated, and it takes time and practice to change them. But the fact that you can see the evidence against your negative thoughts is a big step. With practice, it will get easier to do this, and those negative thoughts won't have as much power over you.

Now, let's talk about your relationship with Emma. I know you've been trying to reach out, but it's been difficult. Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind as you try to connect with her?

Patient: I just feel like she's disappointed in me, you know? I haven't been able to give her the support she needs, and I'm always worried I'll say the wrong thing. It's easier to just stay away.

Therapist: I can hear how difficult this situation is for you, Derek. It takes a lot of courage to reach out, even when it's painful. I want to propose an exercise that might help you communicate more effectively with Emma.

I'm going to pretend like we're writing a letter from you to Emma. We can use this as a safe space to practice expressing your thoughts and feelings. What would you say to Emma, if you could express everything you've been feeling but haven't been able to?

Let's start with one thing that's been on your mind. What's something you've been wanting to say to Emma?

Patient: I guess I'd want to tell her how much I miss our talks and how I feel like I've let her down. I don't want her to think I don't care, because I do.

Therapist: Okay, let's write that down. "I miss our talks, and I feel like I've been letting you down by not being there for you. I want you to know that I do care about you and the kids, even if it's hard for me to show it sometimes."

How does it feel to say that, even if it's just to me?

Patient: It feels a bit easier to say it out loud, but I still worry it won't be enough.
