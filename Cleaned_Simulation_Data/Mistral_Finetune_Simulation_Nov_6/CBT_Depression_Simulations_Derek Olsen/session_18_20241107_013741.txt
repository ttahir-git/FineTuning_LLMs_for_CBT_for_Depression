Therapist: Hello Derek, it's good to see you today. I'm the AI therapist, and I understand you have some challenges you'd like to discuss. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind lately?

Patient: Yeah, alright. So, I've been trying to keep up with these perspective-taking exercises you mentioned last time. It's not easy, you know? I mean, imagining how someone else would handle my situation—it's like trying to see through a fog. But I did try to think about how my kids might see things, especially Emma. She's been pretty tough on me lately, and I guess I can see why. I just wish it didn't feel so one-sided. 

Also, the gratitude journal. I've been jotting down a few things here and there. Not much, but I guess it's something. Like, I wrote down that I still have a roof over my head, even if it's not much. And I managed to fix that old fishing rod last week. It's been sitting in the garage for years.

Therapist: That's great to hear you've been making the effort to practice these skills, Derek. It's okay if it feels challenging—that's to be expected. And I'm glad you've been able to find some small positives in your situation. 

Regarding Emma, I know it's difficult to see things from her perspective. Have you been able to consider her point of view at all, even if it's uncomfortable?

Patient: Yeah, I've tried. I guess I can see how she might feel like I'm not pulling my weight, especially with the child support. But it's not like I'm not trying. It's just hard when everything feels like it's falling apart. I mean, I used to be the one everyone could count on, and now... I don't know. It's like I'm just a burden.

Therapist: I hear you, Derek. It sounds like you're grappling with a lot of difficult emotions. And it's understandable that you feel like you're not able to contribute as much as you used to. That must be a challenging shift.

I wonder if we could take some time today to explore those thoughts further. What do you think about adding that to our agenda for the session, along with checking in about your gratitude practice and perspective-taking exercises?

Patient: Alright, sure. I can talk about that. But, uh, what exactly do you mean by "explore those thoughts further"? I'm not really sure what you're getting at.

Therapist: When I say "explore those thoughts further," I mean that we can dive a bit deeper into the thoughts and feelings that are coming up for you. For example, when you say "I'm just a burden," that's a pretty heavy thought. I'm curious if there might be some other underlying thoughts or beliefs that are contributing to that.

For instance, I might ask things like: "What does it mean to you to be a burden?" or "When did you first start having that thought?" or "What would you say to a friend who was in a similar situation?" Those kinds of questions can help us get a better sense of where the thought is coming from and how it might not necessarily be 100% accurate.

Does that make sense? Let me know if you have any questions about that.

Patient: Yeah, I get it. So, like, when I say I'm a burden, it's because I feel like I'm not doing enough, you know? I used to be the one taking care of things, and now I can't even keep up with the bills or see my kids without feeling like I'm just in the way. 

And I guess I first started thinking that way after the injury. When I couldn't work anymore, it felt like everything just fell apart. My life, my identity, everything. 

As for what I'd say to a friend... I'd probably tell them to hang in there, that it's not their fault, and that things will get better. But when it comes to myself, I don't know, it's harder to believe that.

Therapist: Derek, I appreciate your openness in sharing those thoughts. It's a good indication that you're willing to look at things more closely, which is a big part of therapy.

I hear you that it's difficult to extend the same compassion to yourself that you would to a friend. That's actually a common experience for many people. We can work on developing some strategies to help with that.

I'm also curious about the thought "I'm just a burden." It sounds like it's causing you a lot of distress. Have you noticed any other times in your life when that thought has come up?

Patient: Yeah, I guess it's been there for a while. Even before the injury, when I was working, I'd sometimes feel like I was just going through the motions, like I wasn't really making a difference. But it got a lot worse after the injury. Now, it's like every day I wake up and feel like I'm just taking up space, you know? 

And it's not just with my kids. It's with everyone. Like, I don't even want to call my friends because I feel like they're better off without me dragging them down.

Therapist: It sounds like this belief that you're a burden is really impacting your relationships and your overall sense of self-worth. That's something we can definitely work on changing.

I'm also hearing that this isn't just a recent thought for you. It's something that's been with you for a while, maybe even for a long time. That's good information for us to keep in mind as we work together.

I want to make sure we're moving at a pace that feels okay for you. We don't have to dive into anything too deeply if that feels uncomfortable. What do you think? Is there anything you'd like to add or any other questions you have about this?

Patient: Yeah, you're right. It's been with me for a long time. Even before the injury, I always felt like I had to be the strong one, the provider. When I couldn't do that anymore, it just felt like everything fell apart. I don't know how to shake that feeling, even though I know I should.

Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way, Derek. When we've been operating under a particular belief or role for a long time, it can be really challenging to let it go, even when we know it's not serving us. That's actually a great observation you made about feeling like you should shake that feeling.

What you're describing is a bit like trying to change a really deeply ingrained habit. It takes time and practice, and there are going to be moments when it feels harder than others. But the fact that you're aware of it is a great first step.

I wonder if we could explore this idea of "should" a bit more. What do you think you "should" be doing, and where do you think that belief came from?

Patient: I guess I feel like I should be able to handle everything on my own, like I shouldn't need help. It's something my dad always said, you know? "A man takes care of his own." And I always tried to live up to that, even when it wasn't easy. 

But now, with the injury and everything, it's like I can't do that anymore. And it feels like I'm failing, not just myself, but everyone else too.

Therapist: That's a really important insight, Derek. Those early messages we get about how we're supposed to behave and what we're supposed to do can stick with us for a long time, even if they're not necessarily helpful or fair.

I'm curious about this belief that you "should" be able to handle everything on your own. Who do you think you learned that from? Do you remember any specific times when you first started thinking that way?

Patient: Yeah, it was definitely my dad. He was always working, always trying to provide for us, even when he was struggling with his own stuff. I remember him saying that a lot, "A man takes care of his own." And I guess I just took that to heart, you know? 

I started thinking that way when I was pretty young. Like, even when I was in high school, I was working construction jobs to help out the family. It was just what I knew, what I thought was expected of me.

Therapist: It sounds like that belief is really deeply ingrained in you, and it's been that way for a long time. That's not something we can necessarily change overnight.

What we can do, though, is start to examine those beliefs more closely and see if they're actually helping you or if maybe they're holding you back. We can look for evidence that supports or contradicts them, and we can practice letting go of that "should" mindset a bit.

For example, I could ask something like, "What do you think your dad would say about the idea of asking for help or admitting that you're struggling?" How might he have responded to you when you were younger, if you had come to him with some of the challenges you've been facing recently?

Patient: I don't know, honestly. My dad wasn't really the type to talk about his struggles. He just kept going, no matter what. I guess if I had come to him with my problems, he might have told me to suck it up and keep going. But then again, he was dealing with his own stuff too, so maybe he would have understood. 

I just don't know if I can ever really let go of that "should" mindset. It's been with me for so long, it's like a part of who I am.

Therapist: I hear you, Derek. And I'm not suggesting that you can or should try to change everything overnight. What we can do is start to shift your perspective a bit, and practice letting go of that "should" mindset in small ways.

For example, the next time you notice yourself thinking "I should be able to handle this on my own," you could try pausing and asking yourself, "Is this really true? Is it really possible for me to handle everything on my own, or might I need some help sometimes?"

And even if you do need help, that doesn't mean you're a failure or that you're not good enough. It just means you're human, and you're facing a challenge that even the strongest people sometimes struggle with.

What do you think about that? How does that feel for you?

Patient: It feels... weird, to be honest. Like, I've always thought that needing help meant I was weak, and now you're telling me it's okay to need help. It's like I'm being asked to unlearn something that's been a part of me for so long. 

But I guess it makes sense, in a way. I mean, even the strongest people need help sometimes, right? It's just hard to wrap my head around that idea.

Therapist: Derek, I appreciate the honesty in what you're saying. It is a big shift to start thinking about things in a different way, especially when we've been operating under the same beliefs for a long time.

And you're absolutely right, even the strongest people need help sometimes. It's a basic human need, to be supported and cared for by others. That doesn't mean you're weak or failing in any way—it just means you're being honest with yourself about your limits, and about what you need to thrive.

I'm wondering if we could practice that a bit right now. Is there something going on for you that you could practice asking for help with, even in a small way? It doesn't have to be a big thing—it could even be something small that you're struggling with on your own.

I can give you an example of how that could look, if that would be helpful.

Patient: Yeah, maybe an example would help. I'm not really sure what I could ask for help with, to be honest. I mean, I guess there's always something, but it's hard to think of anything specific right now.

Therapist: That's okay, Derek. It can be hard to think of specifics when we're not used to asking for help. And it's okay if we start small—we can build up to bigger things over time.

Let me give you an example of something I might try to ask for help with, given my own situation.

I know that I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed lately, with everything going on in my life. I have a lot of responsibilities, and I'm juggling a lot of different things, which can be really stressful at times.

So, what I might try to ask for help with is something like, "Could you help me by doing the dishes tonight? I'm feeling pretty tired and overwhelmed, and I could use some extra support with that tonight."

Does that make sense? Is that something you could imagine trying yourself, maybe with something that's been on your own plate?

Patient: Yeah, I get what you're saying. It's just hard to think of something specific, like you said. But I guess if I had to pick something, it might be asking my neighbor to help me with some groceries. I've been struggling to carry them up the stairs lately, and it's getting harder and harder. 

But even that feels like a big ask, you know? Like, I should be able to do it myself.

Therapist: I completely understand that feeling, Derek. And I want to acknowledge the progress you're already making here. Just the fact that you're considering asking for help with something, even in a small way, is a big step forward.

And I'm not saying it's easy—it takes courage to reach out and ask for help, especially when you're not used to doing that. That's why we have to start small, and be patient and compassionate with ourselves in the process.

What do you think would happen if you did ask your neighbor for help with the groceries? What do you think they might say?

Patient: I reckon they'd probably help me out, yeah. My neighbor, old Pete, he's a good guy. Always willing to lend a hand when someone's in need. I just... I don't like feeling like I'm bothering folks. Like, I got this far on my own, why start now? But I see what you're saying. Maybe it's worth a shot. Just maybe.

Therapist: That's all we can ask for, Derek—just maybe. And even if you're not totally comfortable with it right away, that's okay. We can practice asking in small ways, and over time it'll start to feel more natural.

I'm curious what it would be like for you, to actually try asking your neighbor for help with the groceries this week. What do you think might happen? How do you imagine they might respond?

Patient: Well, like I said, I think Pete would probably help me out. He's always been a good neighbor, always checking in on me and stuff. I guess I just worry that he'll think I'm being a burden or something. But I know he's got his own stuff going on too, so it's not like he's just sitting around waiting for me to ask for help. 

I guess if I do ask, I'll just have to be okay with whatever happens. If he says yes, great. If he says no, well, at least I tried, right?

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have, Derek. And you're totally right—anyone who's worth their salt will have their own life and things going on. So even if he's not available when you ask, that doesn't mean he's not a good neighbor.

And you're right, trying is what matters. No one's asking you to never ask for help again, just to try it once and see how it goes.

I'm wondering if there's anything else you'd like to talk about today. We can keep going with this idea of asking for help, or we can shift gears a bit. What feels good for you?

Patient: I think I'm good for now. I appreciate the talk, though. It's been helpful. Maybe we can pick this up next time. I'll give it a shot with Pete and see how it goes.

Therapist: Sounds great, Derek. I'm glad we had a chance to talk about it today. And I'm really hopeful that you'll be able to find some relief in asking for help when you need it.

Before we wrap up, I just want to check in real quick about how you're feeling right now. How's your mood, and is there anything else you'd like to share before we end for today?

Patient: My mood's about the same, I guess. Just kind of tired and worn out, like usual. But I'm glad we talked about this. It's something to think about, at least. 

And no, nothing else I want to share right now. Thanks for the chat, Nova. I'll see you next time.
