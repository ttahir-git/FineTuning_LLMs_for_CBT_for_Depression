I hear how deeply this affects you, Derek. The shift from being the provider and helper to needing help yourself is clearly challenging. Let's try something: If Jake was in your situation - dealing with physical limitations and needing help - would you consider him a burden?
Me: No, of course not. He's my son. I'd want to help him however I could. But it's different when it's me. I'm supposed to be the one helping him, not the other way around.
Therapist: That's a really important insight, Derek. Notice how you naturally extend compassion to Jake in a hypothetical situation, but you're much harder on yourself in reality. This is a common pattern - we often hold ourselves to much higher standards than we do others.

What would it be like to try showing yourself the same understanding and compassion that you'd show Jake? I know it might feel uncomfortable or unfamiliar, but it's worth considering.

Also, I'm wondering - what do you think Jake would say if he heard you describe yourself as a burden?
Me: *sighs* He'd probably tell me I'm being ridiculous. He's always saying that I taught him everything he knows about construction and home repairs. But it's hard to accept that things are different now. I keep comparing myself to how I used to be, and I come up short every time.

I get what you're saying about being harder on myself than others. It makes sense when you put it that way. But changing how I think about myself... that's not easy.
Therapist: You're absolutely right - changing these deeply held beliefs about yourself isn't easy, and it won't happen overnight. But recognizing that you're being harder on yourself than you would be on others is an important first step.

Let's try something practical. When you notice yourself having these thoughts about being useless or a burden, could you try asking yourself: "What would I say to Jake if he was feeling this way?" This might help create a little distance from the harsh self-judgment and open up space for a more balanced perspective.

Would you be willing to try that this week? And maybe we could also practice some mindfulness techniques now to help manage these difficult thoughts and emotions. Would that be helpful?
Me: Yeah, I can try that. Asking myself what I'd say to Jake... that might help put things in perspective. And yeah, let's try the mindfulness stuff. My thoughts have been pretty loud lately, if you know what I mean. Anything that might quiet them down would be good.
Therapist: I understand completely about the "loud thoughts." Let's try a simple mindfulness exercise that you can use when those thoughts become overwhelming. This is called the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique.

Would you like to try it now? It involves using your senses to connect with your present environment, which can help quiet those racing thoughts. I can guide you through it step by step. How does that sound?
Me: Sure, I'll give it a shot. What do I need to do?
Therapist: Great, I'll guide you through it. This exercise can be done anywhere, anytime you're feeling overwhelmed. You can do it sitting or standing, whatever's most comfortable for your back.

Start by taking a slow, deep breath. Then:

1. Name 5 things you can SEE right now in your environment
2. Name 4 things you can FEEL (like the chair against your back, your feet on the floor)
3. Name 3 things you can HEAR
4. Name 2 things you can SMELL
5. Name 1 thing you can TASTE

Would you like to try it now? Just tell me what you notice for each sense, and we'll go through it together.
Me: Okay, let me try.

I can see... my computer screen, a coffee mug, some papers on my desk, the window, and a picture of my kids.

I can feel the chair I'm sitting in, my hands on the keyboard, my feet on the floor, and my shirt on my shoulders.

I can hear the hum of my computer, a car going by outside, and my neighbor's dog barking.

Smell... coffee from my mug, and I guess the laundry detergent on my shirt.

Taste... just the coffee I was drinking.
Therapist: Excellent job, Derek! How do you feel after doing that exercise? Did you notice any change in your thoughts or tension level?

This is a technique you can use anytime you're feeling overwhelmed or when those negative thoughts are getting too loud. It helps bring your attention back to the present moment instead of getting caught up in worried thoughts about the past or future.

Would this be something you could see yourself using during the day, especially when you're feeling stressed or when those thoughts about being "useless" or a "burden" come up?
Me: Yeah, that was... different. It did kind of slow things down in my head for a minute. Made me focus on what's actually around me instead of all the stuff I've been worried about. I could probably do this when I'm getting worked up about things. Might be especially helpful when my back pain is acting up and I start getting frustrated.

It's simple enough, at least. Don't need any special equipment or anything. Just pay attention to what's around me.
Therapist: That's exactly right, Derek! I'm glad you found it helpful. And you've made a great observation about using it when your back pain flares up - that's an excellent application of this technique. Pain can often trigger those negative thoughts, so having a tool to help ground yourself in those moments can be really valuable.

For homework this week, I'd suggest:

1. Continue with your thought record, but try adding the question "What would I say to Jake in this situation?"
2. Practice the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique at least once a day, especially when you're feeling stressed or in pain
3. Continue with your woodworking projects, celebrating the small accomplishments

How does that sound? Is there anything else you'd like to add or modify about these homework assignments?
Me: That sounds manageable. I'll keep working on the thought record, though I still think it's kind of weird. The grounding thing might actually help, so I'll definitely try that. And yeah, I've got another small woodworking project in mind - thinking about making a jewelry box for my daughter.

Just... thanks for being patient with me. I know I can be pretty negative sometimes.
Therapist: Thank you for that acknowledgment, Derek. Your willingness to try these techniques, even when you're skeptical, shows real courage and commitment to making changes. The jewelry box project sounds wonderful - it's a perfect example of adapting your woodworking skills to your current capabilities while creating something meaningful for someone you love.

Before we wrap up today's session, I want to check in with how you're feeling now compared to when we started. How are you doing?

Also, is there anything specific you'd like to focus on in our next session?
Me: I'm feeling a bit better, actually. Still tired, but maybe a little clearer in my head. The grounding exercise helped, and talking through some of this stuff... well, it helps to get it out sometimes.

For next time, maybe we could talk more about dealing with the pain? Like, how to manage it without letting it take over everything. And maybe... maybe we could talk more about how to communicate better with my kids. I've been thinking about what you said about opening up to Jake.
Therapist: Those are excellent topics for our next session, Derek. We can definitely explore pain management strategies and work on communication skills. Your willingness to consider opening up more to Jake shows real progress.

You've done good work today - practicing the grounding technique, sharing your thoughts honestly, and setting meaningful goals with the jewelry box project. Remember to be patient with yourself as you practice these new skills.

Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end today's session?
Me: No, I think I'm good for today. Thanks for listening and for teaching me that grounding thing. I'll try to work on the homework and see how it goes. Same time next week?
Therapist: Yes, same time next week. I look forward to hearing about your experiences with the grounding technique and how the jewelry box project goes. Remember, you can use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique anytime you need it, and take things one day at a time.

Take care, Derek, and I'll see you next week.
Me: Thanks, see you next week.
