I apologize, but I don't see the conversation history from session 8 that you'd like me to summarize. Without access to the actual session content, I cannot provide a meaningful summary of what was discussed, the techniques used, or the insights gained.

If you could share the session details you'd like me to analyze, I'll be happy to provide a structured summary focusing on:
1. Main topics discussed
2. Techniques/exercises introduced
3. Helpful elements
4. Assigned homework
5. Key insights and realizations

Please provide the session content, and I'll help summarize it for you.
