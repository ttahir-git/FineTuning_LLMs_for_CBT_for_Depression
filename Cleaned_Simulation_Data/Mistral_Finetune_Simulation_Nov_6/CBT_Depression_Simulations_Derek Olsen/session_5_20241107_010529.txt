Therapist: Hello Derek, it's good to see you again. Emma mentioned that she enjoyed her time with you and found the conversation meaningful. I'm glad to hear that you're making progress on the homework we discussed last time. Before we dive into today's session, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. I also want to remind you that I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Finally, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to directly observe or interpret your non-verbal cues, which can be an important aspect of therapy. With all that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How are you feeling today, Derek?
###.

Patient: Yeah, I'm here. Emma and I did have a good talk. It was nice to catch up. I've been doing those stretches, and they help a bit. Still, some days are tougher than others. I managed to get back into woodworking, and it feels good to create something again. But, you know, it's hard to shake the feeling that I'm not the man I used to be.

Therapist: I understand, Derek. It's common to feel a sense of loss or disappointment when we can no longer do the things we used to. However, it's important to recognize that while you may not be the same man you used to be, you're still the same person at your core. Adapting to new circumstances doesn't change who you are. I'm glad to hear that you're able to engage in woodworking again. It's a great way to express your creativity and find satisfaction in your work. Can you tell me more about the projects you've been working on?

Patient: Well, I've been making some small birdhouses and a couple of wooden toys for the kids in the neighborhood. It's not the same as building a whole house, but it feels good to see people appreciate what I make. I guess it's a start. But, sometimes I can't help but think about what I used to do and how much more I could accomplish back then.

Therapist: It's great that you're finding purpose and joy in creating these birdhouses and toys, Derek. It's okay to feel a sense of loss for what you used to be able to do. But I want to remind you that comparing your current abilities to your past is not always helpful. Each person has their own unique set of strengths and limitations, and it's essential to accept and work within those parameters. Remember, you're still able to do many things that bring you and others happiness, even if it's different from before. Let's focus on the present and what you can do now, rather than dwelling on the past. What do you think about setting an agenda for today's session? We can discuss your woodworking projects, your mood, and how you've been feeling since our last meeting. We can also explore some strategies for managing those difficult days. What would you like to prioritize?

Patient: I guess we can talk about the woodworking. It's been a mixed bag. Some days I feel really good about it, and other days I just get frustrated because it's not the same as before. I've been trying to keep up with the stretching exercises, but it's hard to stay consistent. And, yeah, my mood swings a lot. Some days I feel okay, and other days I just want to stay in bed.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Derek. It's common for mood and motivation to fluctuate, especially when dealing with physical challenges and adjusting to new circumstances. Let's break down what you've shared and see how we can work on each aspect. Regarding your woodworking, it's great that you've been able to engage in it again. Those mixed feelings of pride and frustration are valid. Remember that it's okay to acknowledge both the positive and the challenging aspects of your experience. Can you tell me more about what makes it frustrating?

Patient: It's frustrating because I know I can't do as much as I used to. I used to build entire houses, and now I'm making birdhouses. It feels like a step down, even though I know it's not. I guess I just miss the sense of accomplishment I used to have.

Therapist: I understand your feelings of frustration, Derek. It's natural to miss the sense of accomplishment you used to experience. However, it's essential to reframe how you view your current work. Making birdhouses and wooden toys is still an accomplishment, even if it's different from what you used to do. Let's look at this from another perspective. If a friend of yours, someone you care about, were to express the same frustration, what would you say to them?

Patient: If a friend of mine were in the same situation, I'd probably tell them that it's still something. Even if it's not the same, it's still a way to use their skills and make something useful. I'd remind them that it's okay to feel frustrated, but it's also important to find joy in what they can do now.

Therapist: That's a great point, Derek. You've demonstrated empathy and a balanced perspective. Now, it's time to apply that same understanding to your own situation. Making birdhouses and wooden toys is still a valuable and worthwhile activity, even if it's different from what you used to do. Remember that it's okay to feel frustrated, but try to focus on the joy and sense of purpose you find in your current work. Let's set a goal for you to continue engaging in woodworking, even on days when you're feeling frustrated. Tomorrow, I encourage you to spend at least 30 minutes working on your project, and try to focus on the present moment and the sense of fulfillment you derive from creating. What do you think about that?

Patient: I think that's doable. I'll try to focus on the present and not dwell on what I used to do. It's just hard sometimes, you know? But I'll give it a shot.

Therapist: That's a great attitude, Derek. Remember, it's not about comparing your current work to your past, but rather finding value and purpose in what you're doing now. I'm confident that with practice, it will become easier to focus on the present and find fulfillment in your woodworking. Now, let's discuss your mood and motivation. You mentioned that you've been having mood swings. Can you tell me more about that?

Patient: Yeah, my mood swings are pretty unpredictable. Some days I wake up feeling okay, and I can get through the day without too much trouble. Other days, I just feel down and don't want to do anything. It's like I'm on a roller coaster, and I can't seem to get off.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Derek. Mood swings can be challenging to manage, especially when they feel unpredictable. Remember that this is a common experience for many people dealing with depression. Let's try to find ways to cope with these fluctuations. One strategy is to create a daily routine that includes activities that promote a sense of accomplishment, pleasure, and connection. This can help provide structure and give you a sense of purpose. What are some activities that you enjoy or find rewarding?

Patient: I used to enjoy woodworking and fishing, but like I said, it's hard to get motivated for those things now. I guess watching sports is something I still do, even though it's not the same as being out there doing it. I also try to keep up with my kids, but it's tough when I'm not feeling well.

Therapist: It's great that you've identified some activities that you still find enjoyable, such as watching sports. That's a good start. Now, let's think about how we can incorporate these activities into a daily routine. For example, you could set aside a specific time each day to watch a game or two. This can give you something to look forward to and provide a sense of structure. In addition, try to schedule a few short periods of woodworking each week, even if it's just for 15-20 minutes at a time. Remember, it's okay to start small and build up gradually. What do you think about that?

Patient: I think that could help. Setting aside time for sports and woodworking might give me something to look forward to. I'll try to stick to it and see if it makes a difference.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Derek. Remember, it's all about taking small steps and finding ways to manage the ups and downs of your mood. Another strategy we can use is called behavioral activation. This involves intentionally engaging in activities that promote a sense of accomplishment, pleasure, or connection, even if you don't feel motivated. The idea is that by engaging in these activities, you can gradually build momentum and improve your mood. Let's create a list of activities you can use for behavioral activation. We can include your favorite hobbies, like woodworking and watching sports, as well as other activities that provide a sense of purpose or connection, like calling a friend or going for a walk. What are some other activities you think could be included in your list?

Patient: Well, I could try to get out for a walk when the weather's good. It's not easy with my back, but I know it's good for me. And maybe I could reach out to my kids more often, even if it's just a quick call or text. I know they worry about me, and it might help us stay connected.

Therapist: Those are great ideas, Derek. Getting out for a walk, even if it's just a short one, can be very beneficial for your physical and mental health. And reaching out to your kids is a wonderful way to stay connected and ease their concerns. Remember that small, consistent efforts can make a big difference over time. Let's add those activities to your behavioral activation list, along with woodworking and watching sports. This way, you'll have a variety of options to choose from, depending on how you're feeling and what kind of impact you want to have on your mood. What do you think about that?

Patient: I think that sounds like a good plan. Having a list of things to do might help me get through the days when I'm feeling down. I'll give it a try and see how it goes.

Therapist: That's great, Derek. Remember to be patient with yourself and celebrate the small victories. Every time you engage in one of these activities, you're taking a step towards improving your mood and overall well-being. Now, I want to introduce a technique called thought recording. This can be helpful in managing negative thoughts and feelings. The idea is to write down your thoughts, identify the emotions they trigger, and then challenge the thoughts by looking for evidence that supports or refutes them. For example, if you have the thought, "I'm never going to be able to do the things I used to do," you can write down the emotions that thought triggers, such as sadness or hopelessness. Then, you can challenge that thought by looking for evidence that you are still doing things and finding joy in your current circumstances. Would you like to give this a try?

Patient: I guess it could be worth a shot. I'm not really used to writing things down, but if it helps with my thoughts, I'll give it a try. How exactly do I start?

Therapist: Start by getting a small notebook or journal. You can carry it with you if you want, or keep it in a place where you're likely to see it often, like near your TV or next to your bed. Whenever you notice a negative thought, pause and write it down. Then, write down the emotions that thought triggers. Next, challenge the thought by looking for evidence that supports or refutes it. For example, if the thought is, "I'm never going to be able to do the things I used to do," you could write down evidence like, "I'm still making birdhouses and wooden toys" and "I'm still watching sports, even if it's not as often as before." The goal is to start challenging those negative thoughts and replacing them with more balanced, realistic ones. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds doable. I'll get a notebook and start writing down my thoughts. It might take some time to get used to, but I'll give it a try.

Therapist: That's great, Derek. Remember, it's a skill that takes practice. Don't worry if it feels awkward or challenging at first. The more you do it, the easier it will become. And don't forget to celebrate your small victories along the way. Every time you write down a thought and challenge it, you're taking a step towards better managing your mood and overall well-being.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'll give it a try and see how it goes. I appreciate the support.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Remember that progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. But with practice and patience, you'll start to see a difference in your mood and overall outlook. Now, let's wrap up today's session and talk about what we'll focus on in the coming week.

Patient: Alright, let's wrap it up. I'll focus on getting out for walks when I can and reaching out to my kids more. And I'll start writing down my thoughts in the notebook. Anything else I should keep in mind for next week?

Therapist: For next week, I'd like you to focus on continuing with your behavioral activation plan. Remember to schedule in some time for engaging in hobbies like woodworking and watching sports. Also, keep practicing the thought recording technique we discussed. Write down your thoughts, the emotions they trigger, and then challenge those thoughts with evidence. This will help you start to shift your perspective and develop more balanced thinking patterns. How does that sound?

Patient: Sounds good. I'll keep working on those things and see how it goes. Thanks for the help, Nova.
