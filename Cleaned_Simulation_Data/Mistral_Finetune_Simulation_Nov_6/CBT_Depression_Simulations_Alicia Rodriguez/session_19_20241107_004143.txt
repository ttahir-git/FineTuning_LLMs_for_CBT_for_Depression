Therapist: Alicia, thank you for your hard work today. I'm proud of the insights and strategies you've developed. Before we end, let's discuss your homework in more detail. 

For setting boundaries at work, I encourage you to start small. Perhaps you could try saying no to an unnecessary meeting or delegating a task to a colleague. Remember to use clear communication and be specific about your needs.

For the salsa class, I'm excited for you to reconnect with an activity that brings you joy. Notice how you feel during and after the class, and reflect on how it impacts your mood and energy.

Finally, use a thought record to track and reframe any unhelpful thoughts that arise around productivity or self-worth. This will help you continue to challenge those negative beliefs.

How do you feel about this homework plan?

Patient: I appreciate the encouragement, Nova. Starting small with boundaries at work makes sense. I'll try saying no to a meeting that isn't crucial or delegating a task. I've been hesitant to do that, but I see how it could help.

As for the salsa class, I'm both excited and a bit nervous. It's been a while since I've danced, and I hope it brings back the joy I used to feel. I'll definitely pay attention to how I feel during and after the class.

Using a thought record to track and reframe unhelpful thoughts is something I need to get better at. I tend to dismiss them quickly, but I know they affect me more than I realize. I'll give it a try and see how it goes.

Overall, I feel positive about this homework plan. It's manageable and practical, which is what I need right now.
