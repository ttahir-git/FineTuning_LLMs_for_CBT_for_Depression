Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again for session 6. Thank you for sharing the summary from our previous session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. 

With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start by checking in â€“ how have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any changes or notable experiences you'd like to share?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency.

Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of things. The journaling has been helpful in tracking my thoughts and emotions, but I still find myself slipping back into old patterns. I've been trying to delegate more, but it's tough. I had a situation last week where I delegated a task to a team member, and they made a small mistake. It made me question whether I should have just done it myself. 

Overall, I'm still feeling pretty overwhelmed with work and the pressure to prove myself. I've also been struggling with insomnia, which doesn't help. I'm hoping we can talk more about how to manage these feelings and maybe some strategies for better sleep.

Therapist: It's great that you've been journaling and making efforts to delegate, even if it's been challenging. I understand the doubt and questioning that can come up when trying new approaches. The situation with your team member is a good opportunity for us to explore.

Before we dive in, let's set an agenda for today's session. You mentioned wanting to discuss managing overwhelming feelings, proofing yourself, and sleep. What else would you like to prioritize today? We can also review your homework and progress with the CBT triangle and generating balanced thoughts.

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I think we should definitely prioritize managing overwhelming feelings and sleep. The proofing myself aspect is always there, but I feel like I've been making some progress in recognizing when it's happening. 

I'd also like to talk more about the CBT triangle and balanced thoughts. I've been trying to use them, but sometimes it feels a bit abstract. Maybe you could give me an example to help clarify?

Therapist: Absolutely, we can definitely dive deeper into the CBT triangle and balanced thoughts. Before we do, let's explore the situation with your team member a bit more. It's understandable to feel doubtful when something doesn't go perfectly.

Can you walk me through what happened with the delegated task and the mistake? What thoughts and emotions came up for you?

Patient: Sure, I can walk you through it. So, I assigned a relatively straightforward task to one of my team members, let's call her Sarah. It involved updating some code for a minor feature. I thought it was something she could handle easily.

When she submitted the code, there was a small error that slipped through. It wasn't a major issue, but it was enough to make me question whether I should have just done it myself. My immediate thoughts were: "I should have known better. I can't trust others to do things right." 

Emotionally, I felt frustrated and a bit anxious. I started worrying about what others would think of my leadership if they found out I delegated something that wasn't done perfectly.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Alicia. It's clear that the situation brought up some challenging thoughts and emotions. Let's break this down using the CBT triangle.

The situation was that your team member made a small error on a delegated task. The thoughts that came up were: "I should have known better. I can't trust others to do things right." The emotions you experienced were frustration and anxiety. Is that accurate?

Patient: Yes, that's accurate. I felt frustrated and anxious because of those thoughts. I was worried about what others would think of my leadership if they found out about the mistake.

Therapist: Okay, let's look at the thoughts in more detail. The first one, "I should have known better," carries an underlying belief of "I'm not good at delegating." Does that resonate with you?

Patient: Yes, that does resonate. I do feel like I'm not good at delegating, especially when things don't go perfectly. It reinforces my belief that I need to do everything myself to ensure it's done right.

Therapist: That's a great insight. This belief is likely contributing to your difficulty delegating and the feelings of frustration and anxiety that come up when things don't go perfectly. Let's explore this belief further.

What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not good at delegating?

Patient: Well, there's the recent incident with Sarah, which is a clear example. I've also had other instances where I delegated tasks and they didn't turn out as expected. It makes me feel like I can't rely on others to do things as well as I can.

Therapist: That's valid. Those instances provide some evidence for the belief. Now, let's look for evidence against the belief. Can you think of any times when delegating went well or led to positive outcomes?

Patient: Hmm, let me think. There was a project a few months ago where I delegated some tasks to another team member, and it actually turned out better than I expected. They came up with some innovative solutions that I hadn't thought of. But those instances are few and far between.

Therapist: That's an important piece of evidence against the belief. It shows that delegating can lead to positive outcomes and valuable insights. It might be helpful to create a list of these experiences to remind yourself that delegating can be successful, even if it feels like it doesn't happen often.

Now, let's generate a more balanced thought based on the evidence. Instead of "I'm not good at delegating," what might be a more helpful way to view this situation?

Patient: Maybe something like, "I'm still learning how to delegate effectively, and there have been times when it's worked out well." That feels a bit more balanced.

Therapist: That's a great balanced thought. It acknowledges that delegating is a skill you're still developing, and it highlights the successes you've had alongside the challenges. How does that thought make you feel compared to the original one?

Patient: It feels a bit more manageable. It's not as overwhelming to think that I'm still learning and that there have been positive outcomes. It takes some of the pressure off.

Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. This is a great example of how generating balanced thoughts can help shift your perspective and emotions. As we continue to practice this skill, it will become easier to catch those unhelpful thoughts and reframe them in a more balanced way.

Now, let's tie this back to the CBT triangle. The situation was the mistake by Sarah, the thoughts were "I should have known better" and "I can't trust others to do things right," the emotions were frustration and anxiety, and the balanced thought is "I'm still learning how to delegate effectively, and there have been times when it's worked out well."

How do you think this balanced thought might change your response to a similar situation in the future?

Patient: I think it would make me more open to trying again with delegating tasks. Instead of feeling like I failed, I'd see it as a learning opportunity. It might also help me be more patient with others and myself.

Therapist: That's a fantastic insight. This balanced thought can serve as a foundation for more adaptive responses and emotions going forward. As we continue to practice challenging unhelpful thoughts and generating balanced ones, it will become easier to manage those feelings of frustration and anxiety.

Before we move on, let's set a homework task related to this skill. Over the next week, I'd like you to keep a log of times when you notice yourself having unhelpful thoughts about delegating. When you catch them, try to reframe them in a more balanced way like we did today. We can review your log together in our next session.

Does that feel manageable?

Patient: Yes, that sounds doable. I'll keep a log and try to reframe those thoughts when they come up. I'm curious to see how it impacts my work and interactions with my team.

Therapist: Great! I'm excited to see how it goes. Let's also continue to work on challenging those unhelpful thoughts related to proofing yourself and perfectionism. If you notice any of those thoughts coming up, try to examine the evidence and generate some balanced thoughts.

Speaking of sleep, let's check in on that. How has it been since our last session? Have you noticed any changes or been able to implement any new strategies?

Patient: Sleep has been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some nights I manage to get a few more hours, but others, I still find myself staring at the ceiling, replaying work issues in my head. I've tried setting a bedtime routine, like reading a few pages of a novel before bed, but it hasn't been consistent.

Therapist: It's common for sleep to be a work in progress, especially when you're dealing with stress and anxiety. Let's explore your bedtime routine a bit more. The concept of consistency is key here. When we create a routine that we stick to, even when things are tough, it can help regulate our sleep patterns over time.

What do you think about incorporating some relaxation techniques into your bedtime routine, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation? We could also explore limiting screen time before bed, as the blue light can interfere with sleep.

Patient: I've heard about those techniques, but I'm not sure how to start. Could you give me an example of what deep breathing might look like? And I do notice that my phone tends to keep me awake, so maybe limiting screen time is a good idea.

Therapist: Absolutely, let me walk you through a simple deep breathing exercise.

1. Find a comfortable seated position, either in bed or in another quiet space.
2. Close your eyes and take a moment to notice any tension in your body.
3. Slowly inhale through your nose for a count of four, filling your lungs.
4. Hold the breath for a count of four.
5. Exhale through your mouth for a count of four, releasing any tension.
6. Repeat this process for several minutes, focusing on the sensation of your breath moving in and out.

This technique can help calm the nervous system and promote relaxation. It's a great tool to use before bed or anytime you're feeling anxious.

As for screen time, try setting a cutoff time about an hour before your desired bedtime. This gives your brain time to shift gears before sleep. You could designate that time for a relaxing activity, like reading or taking a warm bath.

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I'll try the deep breathing exercise and set a screen cutoff time. I'll also keep reading before bed to see if it helps. Hopefully, these changes will make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.

Therapist: Those sound like great strategies. Remember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. If you notice any roadblocks or challenges, we can always problem-solve them together in our sessions.

Speaking of sleep, let's add that to your homework for the next week. In addition to the log for catching unhelpful thoughts about delegating, I'd like you to incorporate the deep breathing exercise before bed, limit screen time before bed, and try reading or another relaxing activity before bed. We can check in on your progress in our next session.

How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a solid plan. I'll keep track of both the thoughts and my sleep routine. I'm hopeful that these changes will make a difference. Looking forward to our next session to discuss how it's going.

Therapist: You've made some great progress in identifying and reframing unhelpful thoughts about delegation and sleep. As we wrap up today's session, I want to check in on how you're feeling. How has your emotional state been since we last met?

Patient: Emotionally, it's been a bit of a mixed bag. Some days I feel more in control, especially when I manage to catch and reframe those negative thoughts. But there are still moments when I feel overwhelmed, especially when work gets intense. The grief over my grandmother is still there, lingering in the background.

Therapist: It's completely normal to have ups and downs. Recognizing the moments when you're feeling more in control is a crucial step in building resilience. And it's okay to acknowledge that grief is still present. The intensity of emotions might fluctuate, but with time and practice, the impact on your overall well-being will improve.

Before we end today's session, let's set a small homework task related to the sleep hygiene strategies we discussed. I'd like you to try incorporating the deep breathing exercise into your bedtime routine, along with limiting screen time before bed. Notice how these changes affect the quality and duration of your sleep. We can discuss your observations in our next session.

How do you feel about that?

Patient: I think that's a good plan. I'll make sure to incorporate the deep breathing exercise and limit my screen time before bed. I'm curious to see how these changes impact my sleep. Looking forward to discussing it in our next session.
