Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again for session 17. Thank you for sharing the summary of our last session. I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI before we begin. While I have access to general information about you, I don't have real-time information about your current situation or emotions. Sometimes, I might generate inaccurate information. Also, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice the progressive muscle relaxation technique and the deep breathing exercises, but I have to admit, I've been struggling to stick to them consistently. Work has been really intense, and I find myself slipping back into old habits, like overworking and not taking breaks. I've also been feeling more isolated, especially after canceling a few social plans. It's like I'm stuck in a loop of feeling overwhelmed and then withdrawing even more.

Therapist: I understand how challenging it can be to balance coping strategies with work and social demands. It's common to face setbacks and slip into old patterns, especially when dealing with stress and anxiety. The fact that you're recognizing these challenges is an important first step. In our session today, we can explore what specific obstacles you're encountering and develop some strategies to help you stay on track with your self-care practices. We can also discuss ways to increase your social support and find a better balance between work and personal life. How does that sound for our agenda today?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I think focusing on the obstacles and finding ways to balance work and personal life would be really helpful. I'm particularly interested in how I can increase my social support without feeling overwhelmed. It's hard to know where to start when I'm already feeling so drained.

Therapist: I appreciate you sharing your struggles with work, self-care, and social connection. It's not uncommon to feel overwhelmed when trying to balance these aspects of life, especially when dealing with depression and anxiety. Today, I'd like to focus on exploring the specific challenges you're facing with implementing your coping strategies and discuss ways to gradually increase your support system. We can also touch on how to set boundaries at work to help you find a better balance. How does that sound for our agenda today?

Patient: That sounds good. I think breaking it down into specific challenges and finding practical solutions will help. I'm particularly interested in how to set boundaries at work without feeling like I'm letting my team down or risking my job. It's hard to know where to draw the line when I'm so used to pushing myself.

Therapist: Setting boundaries at work can be challenging, especially when you're used to putting your own needs aside for the sake of your team or job. In our session, we can explore specific situations where you've struggled to set boundaries and develop strategies to communicate your needs effectively. We'll also discuss ways to prioritize self-care without feeling guilty or like you're not doing enough. Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?

Patient: I think that covers it. I'm looking forward to figuring out how to set those boundaries and prioritize self-care without feeling guilty. It's something I've struggled with for a long time, and I think having a clear plan will help.

Therapist: Great, let's dive into the specific challenges you're facing with setting boundaries at work. Can you think of a recent situation where you struggled to set boundaries or prioritize your needs?

Patient: Sure, there was a recent situation where I was asked to take on an additional project, even though I was already feeling overwhelmed with my current workload. I agreed to take it on because I didn't want to seem like I couldn't handle it, but it ended up causing me a lot of stress and making it even harder to focus on my other tasks. I felt like I was constantly playing catch-up and didn't have time for anything else, including self-care.
