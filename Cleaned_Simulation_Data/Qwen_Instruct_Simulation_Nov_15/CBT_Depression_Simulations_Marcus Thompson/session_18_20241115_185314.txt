It sounds like we made good progress in refining your family activities and addressing some of the challenges you've been facing. Let's start by reviewing some key points and then we can move forward with the next steps.

1. **Structured Weekly Schedule**: How is your new weekly schedule working out? Have you found it helpful to have a structure while also allowing for flexibility?

2. **Challenges and Backup Plans**: You mentioned creating flexible backup plans for when your mother can't attend. Have there been any instances where you needed to use these plans, and how did it go?

3. **Movie Night Logistics**: What steps have you taken to implement a streaming service for movie nights? Have you encountered any specific challenges with this?

4. **Involving Extended Family**: Your realization about involving your sister is very positive. How do you see this change impacting your family activities? Have you had any conversations with her about participating in Sunday activities?

5. **Homework**: How have you been implementing the planned Friday movie night and Sunday seasonal activity? Have you noticed any changes in the family dynamics or in your own stress levels?

6. **Insights and Realizations**: Reflecting on the insights you gained, how do you feel about maintaining flexibility while still keeping regular activities? Have there been any new realizations or changes in your approach that you'd like to share?

Let's discuss these points and see how we can further enhance your family activities and support systems.

Patient: Hey Nova, good to see you too. Let’s dive into those points.

1. **Structured Weekly Schedule**: The new schedule has been a lifesaver. It’s like having a roadmap to follow, but knowing I can detour if needed. Balance is key, and it’s been working well.

2. **Challenges and Backup Plans**: Gloria had a rough week about two weeks ago. The backup plan kicked in, and my sister took over for a few days. It went smoother than expected, thanks to the prep work we did.

3. **Movie Night Logistics**: Got a streaming service set up last week. Had to troubleshoot some tech issues with my kids, but we’re good now. We watched a documentary about civil rights, which sparked a great discussion.

4. **Involving Extended Family**: My sister seemed open to the idea when we briefly talked. I think having her more involved will ease some of the load and bring in fresh energy.

5. **Homework**: Friday movie nights have been consistent, and Sundays have been wonderful with seasonal activities like apple picking. The kids are definitely happier, and I feel less stressed knowing we have these regular, fun times planned.

6. **Insights and Realizations**: Flexibility is crucial, especially given all the variables in our lives. I’ve realized that being rigid only adds to the stress. It’s about being adaptable

Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to hear that you're finding the structured weekly schedule to be helpful and that the backup plans are working well. Let's continue to explore how you can maintain this balance and build on your progress.

1. **Structured Weekly Schedule**: That's fantastic to hear! It’s important to have a structure that provides a sense of routine while also being flexible enough to adapt to unexpected changes. Keep noting what works and what doesn't, and adjust as necessary. This will help you fine-tune the schedule even further.

2. **Challenges and Backup Plans**: It's great that the backup plan worked smoothly when needed. Regularly testing these plans can help ensure they work as intended. Perhaps you could discuss with your family members what specific roles they might take on in these backup scenarios. This can make it easier to implement when needed.

3. **Movie Night Logistics**: Using a streaming service is a brilliant solution! It's great that you've already had a meaningful discussion with the kids. Continue to use these movie nights as a way to spark conversations and learn more about their interests. This can enhance the bonding experience and make the activities even more enjoyable.

4. **Involving Extended Family**: Including your sister is a positive step. It sounds like she’s open to participating. You might want to set up a brief family meeting to introduce the idea more formally and get her more involved in planning. This could also be a great opportunity to share responsibilities and make the activities more inclusive.

5. **Homework**: It’s wonderful to hear that the Friday movie nights and Sunday activities have become consistent and enjoyable for everyone. Keep up the good work! Regular check-ins with your family can also help reinforce these positive habits and ensure everyone feels included.

6. **Insights and Realizations**: Your understanding of the importance of flexibility is key. Being adaptable not only helps manage stress but also strengthens family relationships. Moving forward, try to incorporate a few more flexible elements into your schedule. For example, you could include a "Family Fun Night" once a month where anything goes—a board game, a craft, or even a surprise outing.

For the next session, let's focus on:

- **Enhancing Family Involvement**: Develop a more structured plan for involving your sister in family activities.
- **Improving Tech Skills**: Continue to improve your family’s tech skills for activities like streaming services. Maybe set up a few practice sessions.
- **Regular Check-Ins**: Plan more regular check-ins with your family to ensure everyone is engaged and to address any issues promptly.
- **Additional Activities**: Brainstorm and plan a few new activities that the family can enjoy together. This will help keep everyone excited and looking forward to family time.

How does that sound? Are there any specific activities or plans you're excited about implementing in the coming weeks?

Patient: That sounds like a solid plan, Nova. Let’s break it down.

1. **Enhancing Family Involvement**: I’ll set up a family meeting this weekend to formally introduce the idea of my sister joining in. We can discuss roles and responsibilities, making it more official and inclusive.

2. **Improving Tech Skills**: My kids are pretty tech-savvy, but I’ll set up a couple of practice sessions. Maybe we can do a mini-workshop where they teach me and their grandma some basics. It’ll be fun and educational.

3. **Regular Check-Ins**: I’ll start doing weekly check-ins with the family. Maybe a quick 10-minute chat after dinner to see how everyone’s feeling and if there’s anything we need to adjust.

4. **Additional Activities**: I’m thinking of starting a monthly “Family Fun Night.” We can do something different each time—maybe a board game night, a craft project, or even a surprise outing. I’ll brainstorm some ideas with the kids and see what they’re excited about.

I’m particularly excited about the “Family Fun Night” idea. It’s a great way to keep things fresh and exciting. Plus, it’ll give us a chance to try out new things together.

The tech skills workshop is a great idea. I’ve noticed Aisha is pretty tech-savvy, so she could help Jamal and maybe even teach us a few things. It’ll be good for them to take on some responsibility and feel more involved.

For the weekly check-ins, I’ll keep it brief but make sure everyone knows their feelings are important. I want to make sure we’re not just going through the motions but actually hearing each other out.

As for the "Family Fun Night," I’ll start brainstorming with the kids tomorrow. We could do something simple like a board game night or a craft project. I’ll ask them what they’re interested in and make sure to include options that everyone can enjoy.
