I understand your concern about consistency. It's very common for caregivers to put their own needs last. Here are some practical tips to help you maintain this boundary:

1. **Set a Daily Alarm**: This can serve as a reminder that it's your time. Think of it as an important appointment with yourself.

2. **Create a Ritual**: Having a specific activity or routine can help signal that this is your time. For example:
   - Making a cup of tea
   - Going to a specific room or spot
   - Putting on comfortable clothes
   - Using headphones as a visual signal to others

3. **Prepare Others in Advance**: 
   - Let your mom know ahead of time: "Mom, at 7 PM, I'll be taking my 30-minute break. I'll be back at 7:30."
   - Have something set up for her to do during this time (TV show, book, puzzle)
   - Make sure she has everything she needs before your break

4. **Start with 15 Minutes**: If 30 minutes feels too challenging at first, it's perfectly okay to start with 15 minutes and gradually increase the time.

Which of these suggestions resonates with you? And what kind of activities would you like to do during your self-care time?

Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again. I'm glad we had those tips for maintaining your self-care routine. Let's see which suggestions feel most helpful for you and discuss what kind of activities you might enjoy during your self-care time.

From the list:

1. **Setting a Daily Alarm**: This could be a good way to ensure you don't forget your break time. It's like scheduling an important appointment with yourself, which can help make it a priority.
2. **Creating a Ritual**: Having a specific activity or routine can indeed signal to yourself and others that this time is dedicated to you. It might be something as simple as making a cup of tea or going to a certain spot in your home.
3. **Preparing Others in Advance**: Informing your mom about your break time and setting up an activity for her can reduce the chances of interruptions. This way, you both know what to expect.
4. **Starting with 15 Minutes**: Gradually building up your self-care time is a practical approach. Starting with shorter periods can help you get into the habit.

Which one of these feels most manageable for you right now? And in terms of activities, what kinds of things would you enjoy doing during your break? For example, reading, listening to music, meditating, or perhaps engaging in a hobby?

Also, let's discuss your thoughts on how you might implement these suggestions in your daily routine. Any ideas or concerns you have about starting this new practice?

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for the tips. I think setting a daily alarm could work well for me. I'm pretty disciplined when it comes to my morning runs, so setting an alarm for my self-care time might help me stick to it. I could use my phone alarm, maybe set it for 7 PM like we talked about last time.

As for activities, I think I'd enjoy reading historical biographies. It's something I love but rarely get to do because of my busy schedule. I could also listen to some jazz music, maybe even play my saxophone a bit. It's been a while since I've done that, and it might be a nice way to unwind.

Implementing this in my daily routine isn't too hard, but I do worry about my mom. She might not understand why I need this time, and I don't want her to feel neglected. I'll need to explain it to her gently and make sure she has something to keep her occupied during my break. Maybe I can set up a TV show she likes or a puzzle.

Any suggestions on how to approach that conversation with her?

Therapist: Hello Marcus, thank you for sharing your thoughts and plans. Let's break down the steps to help you implement the self-care routine effectively and address your concerns about your mom.

### Setting the Daily Alarm
Great idea to use your phone alarm for your self-care time. Setting a specific time, such as 7 PM, can indeed make it a routine part of your day. You might also consider setting a reminder for 30 minutes beforehand to prepare mentally and physically.

### Activities You Enjoy
Reading historical biographies and listening to jazz music are excellent choices. Engaging in music can be a great stress reliever, and reading can be a soothing way to unwind. Playing your saxophone is another great idea, and you might even consider incorporating some simple practice routines into your self-care time.

### Communicating with Your Mom
It's important to explain the importance of self-care and how it benefits you and the family in the long run. Here’s a suggested approach to discussing this with your mom:

1. **Choose a Comfortable Time**: Find a quiet moment when your mom is likely to be relaxed and receptive. Perhaps after dinner or before bed could be good times.
2. **Start with Positive Reinforcement**: Begin by expressing your appreciation for her caregiving role and how much she means to you.
3. **Explain the Benefits**: Share how taking this time for yourself will help you be a better caregiver and more present for the family. Mention how it will help you manage stress and stay healthier.
4. **Propose a Plan**: Suggest setting up a routine where you both can have dedicated time. For example, she can watch her favorite show while you take your self-care break, or you can play your saxophone in the room next to her while she does a puzzle or reads.
5. **Ask for Her Input**: Involve your mom in the process by asking for her ideas and feedback. This can make her feel more included and valued.

Here’s a sample script you could use:

---

"Mom, I wanted to talk to you about something important. Taking care of myself is crucial, and I think it will help me be a better caregiver and more present for the family. I plan to take a 30-minute break every day starting at 7 PM. During this time, I’ll be reading a historical biography, listening to jazz music, or practicing my saxophone. It will help me manage stress and stay healthier.

I know you’re busy, but I’d like to set up a plan where you can have your own time too. Perhaps we can watch your favorite show during my break, or you could do a puzzle or read a book. I want to make sure both of us are taken care of and that we’re happy and healthy.

What do you think about this plan? Do you have any suggestions or concerns?"

By being proactive and involving your mom in the process, you can help her understand the importance of.

Patient: Thanks for the detailed plan, Nova. I think that script will really help me explain things to my mom. I appreciate how you broke it down into steps—it makes it feel more manageable.

I'll definitely start with the positive reinforcement. She's been through a lot, and I want her to know how much I appreciate her. Explaining the benefits of self-care will be key too. I think she'll understand once I frame it as something that helps me be a better caregiver overall.

Setting up a routine where we both have dedicated time sounds like a good idea. Maybe we can even find a show we both enjoy and watch it together during my break. That way, it's not just about me taking time for myself, but also about us spending quality time together.

I'll try to have this conversation with her tonight. I'll let you know how it goes next session.
