Of course, Marcus. Setting boundaries when you're the primary caregiver can be particularly challenging. Let me share some specific steps and examples that might help you establish healthy boundaries while still being there for your mom:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with one or two specific boundaries
Example: "I need 30 minutes of uninterrupted time each evening to decompress."
- Communicate this to your family
- Set a specific time (like 7:00-7:30 PM)
- Use this time consistently for self-care

2. **Clear Communication**:
Instead of saying: "I can't handle all of this."
Try saying: "I need help with mom's medical appointments on Thursdays because I have important work commitments."

3. **Specific Requests for Help**:
- Make a list of tasks that others could help with
- Be specific about what you need
Example: "Could you stay with mom every other Saturday afternoon from 2-5 PM?"

4. **Learn to Say "No" Constructively**:
Instead of: "I can't do that right now."
Try: "I won't be able to take mom to that appointment, but I can help find someone who can."

5. **Schedule Regular Family Meetings**:
- Set up monthly check-ins with family members
- Share updates about mom's care
- Discuss challenges and needs
- Distribute responsibilities

Would you like to explore any of these strategies in more detail? Which one feels most doable to start with?

Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. Establishing boundaries as a primary caregiver is indeed a crucial step in maintaining your own well-being.

Let's start by focusing on the strategy that feels most manageable for you. Given that you mentioned starting small, perhaps we can begin with the first strategy: **Starting Small**.

### Strategy: Start Small
1. **Choose One or Two Specific Boundaries**: Let's pick one or two boundaries that feel the most pressing or impactful for you. This could be something like your need for uninterrupted time, or ensuring your mom has someone to talk to on certain days.

2. **Communicate Clearly and Assertively**: Once you've identified your boundaries, it's important to communicate them clearly and assertively. Here’s how you might do that:

   - **Example 1**: "I need 30 minutes of uninterrupted time each evening to decompress."
     - **Steps**: 
       - Set a specific time (e.g., 7:00-7:30 PM).
       - Inform your family members about this time and why it's important for you.
       - Use this time consistently for self-care activities like reading, meditating, or having a quiet conversation.

   - **Example 2**: "I need help with mom's medical appointments on Thursdays because I have important work commitments."
     - **Steps**:
       - Share your specific needs with your family.
       - Ask for their support during these times.
       - Offer to help find other family members or friends who can step in when needed.

Would you like to try one of these examples and see how it goes? Perhaps we can practice saying this to a family member during our next session. This will help you get a feel for how to communicate your needs assertively.

Which of these examples feels most doable for you to start with, or is there another boundary you’d like to explore first?

Patient: Thanks for the detailed explanation, Nova. I think starting small with the 30 minutes of uninterrupted time each evening sounds manageable. I often find myself getting caught up in work or family responsibilities until late at night, and I end up feeling drained. Setting aside that time for myself could really help me recharge.

I can see how setting a specific time, like 7:00-7:30 PM, and communicating that to my family would be important. I'll need to be clear about why this time is important for me, so they understand it's not just about me being selfish.

Do you have any tips on how to make sure I stick to this time consistently? Sometimes, I get so caught up in everything that I forget to take care of myself.
