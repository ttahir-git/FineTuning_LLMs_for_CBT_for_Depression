Therapist: : Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again. Thank you for summarizing our session. Let's dive into today's discussion. From your summary, it seems like you've made significant progress and are well on your way to addressing both the caregiving needs and managing stress eating. 

First, let's discuss your progress with researching in-home care providers. How many providers have you shortlisted so far, and how is your search going? Have you found any names or services that stand out?

Secondly, how are you finding the mindful eating techniques? Are you noticing any changes in your eating habits or stress levels? Have you started using the mindfulness app, and if so, how has that been for you?

Lastly, I'd like to touch on the progress you've made in journaling. Have you found it helpful to track your progress? Are there any specific entries or moments that stand out to you as particularly impactful?

We'll also go over any challenges you might be facing and make any necessary adjustments to your action plan. Looking forward to hearing more about your journey so far!

Patient: Hey, Nova. Thanks for checking in. 

On the caregiving front, I've shortlisted about five in-home care providers. I've been doing my homework, calling around, and checking references. One service, "Care Angels," really stood out because they specialize in Alzheimer's care and have a good reputation in the community. I'm planning to set up interviews with them next week.

As for mindful eating, it's been a mixed bag. I've started using the mindfulness app, and it's been helpful in guiding me through some of the exercises. I've been trying to practice sensory awareness and slow chewing, but I still find myself stress eating late at night. I've noticed that when I do manage to practice mindful eating, I feel more satisfied and less guilty afterward.

Journaling has been surprisingly helpful. I've been tracking my meals and stress levels daily. There was one entry where I wrote about feeling particularly overwhelmed after a long day at school and a stressful visit with my mom. Writing it down helped me see that I was trying to do too much in one day, and it made me realize I need to set better boundaries.

Overall, I'm making progress, but there are still challenges. I'm hoping we can talk more about how to manage those late-night stress eating episodes and maybe tweak my action plan a bit.

Therapist: : Hello Marcus, thank you for sharing your updates and progress. It's great to hear that you've made strides in both areas.

### Caregiving Search:
It's excellent that you've shortlisted five in-home care providers, especially focusing on "Care Angels." Scheduling interviews is a crucial next step. During the interviews, consider asking about their experience with Alzheimer's care, their availability, and how they ensure the safety and comfort of your mother. Additionally, it might be helpful to discuss their communication methods and how they handle emergencies. This will give you a clearer idea of which service best fits your needs.

### Mindful Eating Techniques:
I'm glad you're finding the mindfulness app helpful. It's important to continue practicing sensory awareness and slow chewing, even if it's challenging. Here are a few tips to help manage those late-night stress eating episodes:

1. **Identify Triggers**: Keep a detailed journal of when and what you eat, along with your emotional state. This can help you identify patterns or specific triggers that lead to stress eating.
2. **Healthy Alternatives**: Have healthy, easily accessible snacks (like fruits, nuts, or yogurt) that can help satisfy your cravings without the guilt.
3. **Mindful Breaks**: During the day, take short mindful breaks to practice deep breathing or other relaxation techniques. This can help reduce overall stress levels.
4. **Evening Routine**: Develop a calming evening routine that includes activities other than eating. This could be reading, meditating, or listening to soothing music.
5. **Seek Support**: Consider joining a support group or talking to a friend who can offer accountability and encouragement.

### Journaling:
Your journaling has been very insightful. It's wonderful that you've been able to reflect on your feelings and identify areas for improvement. Keep it up, as it’s a powerful tool for self-awareness and progress.

### Adjustments to Action Plan:
Based on your updates, let's consider some adjustments to your action plan:

1. **Caregiving Search**: Continue with the interviews and evaluate each provider based on your criteria. If "Care Angels" seems like a strong fit, proceed to the next step of discussing contract details.
2. **Mindful Eating**: Set up a structured plan for managing late-night cravings. Maybe schedule a 20-minute break during the day to practice mindfulness, and plan for a healthy snack if hunger strikes.
3. **Stress Management**: Incorporate more stress-reducing activities into your daily routine, such as yoga, walking, or talking with a therapist or support group.
4. **Progress Review**: Plan to review your progress in two weeks instead of one, to give you more time to see tangible changes and make necessary adjustments.

Let's discuss these points in more detail during our next session. I’m confident that with continued effort and support, you’ll make even more progress. Keep up the great work, Marcus.

Patient: Thanks for the detailed feedback, Nova. I appreciate the tips on managing late-night stress eating. I'll definitely try to identify my triggers and keep healthier snacks around.

Regarding the caregiving interviews, I'll make sure to ask about their experience with Alzheimer's and their communication methods. Safety and comfort for my mom are my top priorities.

I'll also work on incorporating more stress-reducing activities into my routine. Maybe I can start with a short walk after school or some yoga in the evening.

Looking forward to our next session to review how these adjustments are working out. Thanks for your support, Nova.
