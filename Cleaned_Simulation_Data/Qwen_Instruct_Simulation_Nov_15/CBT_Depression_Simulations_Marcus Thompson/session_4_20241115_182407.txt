Therapist: : Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again. Thank you for summarizing our previous session. It's clear you've been working diligently on the tasks and exercises we discussed. Let's delve into how things have been going since then.

Firstly, how have you been with the "most important tasks" list and the food journal? Have you noticed any changes in your stress eating or emotional eating patterns? Also, how is your support network holding up? Are there any new developments with your mother's condition, and how are you managing your caregiving responsibilities?

On a positive note, it's wonderful to hear about the progress you've made with the church community and basketball league. Have you found these activities helpful in reducing stress and maintaining a better work-life balance?

Additionally, how are you managing your communication with your ex-wife? Have you had any successful check-ins or faced any challenges?

Lastly, how are you feeling about the mindfulness practices you've started incorporating into your routine? Have you noticed any changes in how you approach situations or handle stress?

Let's also discuss your homework. How have you been with the body scan meditation and mindful eating practices? Have you found them helpful? Is there anything you would like to explore further regarding additional support for your mother's care or professional caregiving options?

Let's work together to address any new challenges and reinforce the strategies that have been working well for you.

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for checking in. I've been trying to stick to that "most important tasks" list, and it's been helping me stay focused, especially with lesson planning. The food journal, though, that's been a bit tougher. I've noticed I still stress eat, especially late at night. It's like I can't resist that sweet potato pie my mom used to make.

My support network has been holding up pretty well. The church community and the basketball league have been great outlets. They really help me unwind and feel connected. My mom's condition is progressing slowly, and it's been challenging to balance her care with everything else. I've been looking into some local caregiver support groups, and I think that might help.

Communication with my ex-wife has been better. We've had some successful check-ins, and it's made co-parenting a bit smoother. We're still working on setting clear boundaries, but it's getting there.

As for the mindfulness practices, I've been trying the body scan meditation and mindful eating. They're helpful, but I still find it hard to fully engage in them. I think I need more practice. I'm also considering looking into professional caregiving options for my mom. It's a lot to handle on my own, and I think it might be time to get some professional help.
