Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again. Thank you for sharing your session summary. It's clear that you've been making some positive strides since our last meeting. Let's start by reviewing the progress you've made and then discuss any new challenges or areas you'd like to explore further.

From the summary, it seems like you've been implementing the strategies we discussed, such as creating a "most important tasks" list, scheduling specific check-in times for your mother's care, and starting to track your emotional eating patterns through a food journal. These are excellent steps. How have these new habits been working for you so far? Have you noticed any changes in how you manage your time and stress levels?

It's also great to hear about the support you're receiving from your church community and basketball league, as well as the improvements in your co-parenting relationship. These support systems can be incredibly helpful. Have you found any new ways to utilize your support network or any new members to add to your network?

Are there any specific areas you're currently struggling with or any new stressors that have arisen since our last session? For example, have you encountered any challenges with your mother's care that you'd like to address, or are there any new aspects of your work or personal life that you'd like to include in our discussions today?

We can also further discuss any additional coping strategies or mindfulness exercises that might be beneficial for you. Let's explore this together and make any necessary adjustments to your plan to ensure you continue to make progress.

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for the warm welcome. It's been a bit of a mixed bag with the new habits. The "most important tasks" list has been a game-changer, especially when it comes to lesson planning and prep. I've been able to stay on top of things more consistently, which has helped with my concentration. But, I've noticed that when I get home, I still tend to zone out and stress eat. The food journal has been eye-openingâ€”I see patterns where I reach for sweets after a particularly tough day at school or when I'm feeling overwhelmed about my mom's condition.

As for the support network, the church community has been a huge help. I've started leading a small group focused on caregiving, which has connected me with others in similar situations. It's been comforting to share experiences and get advice from people who understand what I'm going through. The basketball league has also been a great outlet, but I've been missing a few games here and there because of my mom's care.

One new stressor is that my mom's condition seems to be progressing faster than expected. She's having more trouble with daily tasks, and it's getting harder to manage her care from afar. I'm torn between feeling guilty about not being there enough and the pressure of my own responsibilities. It's a tough balance.

I'm open to exploring

Therapist: Nova: Hello Marcus, thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences. It sounds like you're handling a lot, and it's good to see that you're taking steps to manage your responsibilities and stress. The progress you've made with your "most important tasks" list and the food journal is a positive start. Let's dive deeper into the areas you mentioned.

Firstly, regarding the stress eating, it's great that you've identified patterns and are tracking them. One strategy we can explore further is addressing these triggers through mindfulness. Mindful eating can be particularly useful. This involves paying close attention to your food and the experience of eating, noticing your thoughts and emotions, and choosing healthier alternatives when possible. It might also be helpful to have some healthy, pre-cut snacks on hand for those moments when you're tempted to reach for less healthy options.

Regarding your support network, it's wonderful that you've found a small group at your church focused on caregiving. This can provide a sense of community and practical support. You might also consider exploring other local support groups or online forums where you can connect with caregivers in similar situations. These can be valuable resources for sharing advice, coping strategies, and emotional support.

The challenge of balancing your mom's care with your responsibilities and personal well-being is a common one, and it's important to acknowledge the stress this can create. It's understandable to feel torn between being there for your mother and managing your own life. Setting clear boundaries and communicating effectively with your ex-wife about shared responsibilities might help. You could also consider seeking professional support, such as a geriatric care manager or a social worker, who can provide guidance on caregiving and help lighten your load.

Lastly, let's discuss how we can adapt your current strategies to better manage this new stressor. Perhaps we can refine your schedule to include specific times for checking in on your mother and managing her care, while also ensuring you have dedicated time for self-care. Mindfulness exercises can help you stay grounded and manage stress more effectively.

What do you think about adding mindful eating practices and exploring more support groups? How about we schedule a follow-up session in a couple of weeks to review your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plan?

Patient: Nova, thanks for the suggestions. Mindful eating sounds interesting, but I'm not sure I fully get it. Can you give me an example of what that might look like in practice? Like, what would I do differently when I'm reaching for a snack?

I'm definitely open to exploring more support groups. The one at church has been a lifesaver, but I think more perspectives could help. I'll look into local groups and online forums too.

As for balancing my mom's care, I've been thinking about hiring some help. Maybe a part-time caregiver or a geriatric care manager, like you mentioned. It's tough to let go of some control, but I know it could make things more manageable.

I like the idea of refining my schedule to include specific times for my mom and self-care. I've been trying to stick to a routine, but it's easy to get thrown off track. Mindfulness exercises could help with that, but I'm still figuring out how to make them a consistent part of my day.

Let's definitely schedule a follow-up session. I'm eager to see how these new strategies pan out and make any adjustments needed.

Therapist: : Marcus, thank you for your openness and willingness to explore these new strategies further. Let's break down mindful eating and discuss how you can integrate it into your routine.

### Mindful Eating

**What It Is:**
Mindful eating involves being fully present and aware of your experience of eating, both physically and mentally. It helps you recognize your physical and emotional hunger cues, and it promotes healthier eating habits.

**Steps to Practice Mindful Eating:**
1. **Pause and Breathe:** Before you start eating, take a few deep breaths and notice any physical or emotional sensations you are experiencing. This helps you tune into your body's natural hunger and fullness signals.
2. **Sensory Experience:** Engage all your senses. Notice the color, smell, texture, and taste of your food. Take time to savor each bite.
3. **Eat Slowly:** Chew your food thoroughly and put your utensil down between bites. This allows you to fully enjoy each morsel and avoid overeating.
4. **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to how your body feels as you eat. When you feel full, stop eating. Avoid eating until you feel overly full.

### Example of Mindful Eating:

1. **Before Eating:**
   - Take a few deep breaths.
   - Look at your food and notice its appearance.
   - Smell the food and imagine the flavors.
   - Set your utensil down and take a sip of water or tea to help you relax.

2. **While Eating:**
   - Take small bites and chew slowly.
   - Put your utensil down between bites.
   - Notice the texture and taste of each bite.
   - Pause and check in with your body to see how full you are.

3. **After Eating:**
   - Notice how you feel after eating. Did you enjoy the meal?
   - Reflect on any emotional or physical sensations that arose during the meal.

### Support Groups

That's a great idea to explore more support groups. Here are a few steps to help you get started:

1. **Local Support Groups:**
   - Check with local hospitals, community centers, or senior centers for support groups.
   - Look for groups specifically for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's or dementia.

2. **Online Forums:**
   - Websites like Caregiver Action Network (GAN) and Alzheimer's Association offer online support groups and resources.
   - Platforms like Reddit have communities dedicated to caregiving.

### Balancing Your Mom's Care

Hiring additional help can indeed make things more manageable. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Research and Options:**
   - Look for part-time caregivers through local agencies or online platforms like Care.com.
   - Consider a geriatric care manager who can provide professional support and help you navigate the caregiving process.

2. **Communication and Boundaries:**
   - Communicate openly with your ex-wife about.

Patient: Marcus: Thanks for the detailed explanation on mindful eating, Nova. I think I get it now. It's about slowing down and really paying attention to what I'm eating and how I'm feeling, right? I can see how that might help me make better choices instead of just grabbing something out of stress.

As for the support groups, I'll start by checking out the local options you mentioned. The online forums sound like a good backup plan too, especially when I can't make it to in-person meetings.

Hiring help for my mom's care is definitely something I need to look into more seriously. I'll start by researching local agencies and see what options are available. It's a bit daunting, but I know it could make a big difference.

I appreciate the steps you outlined for balancing my mom's care and setting boundaries. I'll work on communicating better with my ex-wife and see if we can find a more manageable routine.

Mindfulness exercises are still a bit of a challenge for me, but I'm willing to give them another try. Maybe we can go over some specific exercises next time that might be easier for me to incorporate into my day.

Thanks for the support, Nova. I'm feeling more hopeful about these new strategies and looking forward to our next session to see how they're working out.

Therapist: : Marcus, you're very welcome! It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and willing to give these strategies a try. Let's delve a bit deeper into mindfulness exercises to make them more manageable for you.

### Mindfulness Exercises

#### 1. **Body Scan Meditation**
This exercise helps you become aware of the physical sensations in your body and can be a good starting point for integrating mindfulness into your daily routine.

1. **Find a Comfortable Position:** Sit in a comfortable chair or lie down in a quiet space.
2. **Close Your Eyes:** Take a few deep breaths to help you relax.
3. **Start at Your Feet:** Bring your attention to your feet. Notice any sensations, tension, or warmth. Breathe into these areas.
4. **Move Upward:** Slowly bring your attention to your ankles, shins, knees, and so on, moving up your body. Notice any tension or discomfort in each area.
5. **Focus on Your Breath:** As you move up your body, continue to breathe deeply and focus on the sensations in each part of your body.
6. **End at the Top:** End at the top of your head, noticing any sensations there. Take a few deep breaths and slowly open your eyes.

#### 2. **Breathing Exercises**
Breathing exercises can be a quick way to calm your mind and body.

**Steps:**
1. **Find a Quiet Spot:** Sit or lie down in a quiet space.
2. **Close Your Eyes:** Take a few deep breaths to relax.
3. **Count Your Breaths:** As you breathe in, silently count to four, and as you breathe out, count to four. Repeat this cycle for a few minutes.
4. **Focus on Your Breath:** If your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your breath.

This exercise can be done anywhere, making it a practical choice for incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine.

**Steps:**

4. **Return to Your Breath:** When you finish walking, sit or stand quietly and bring your attention back to your breath.

### Communication with Your Ex-Wife

**Steps to Improve Communication:**
1. **Schedule Regular Check-ins:** Set aside specific times each week to discuss your mom's care and any related issues.
2. **Be Clear and Honest:** Communicate your needs and concerns clearly. For example, discuss how you can share responsibilities and when you need extra support.
3. **Co-Create.

Patient: Marcus: Those mindfulness exercises sound more manageable, especially the body scan and breathing ones. I can see how they might help me stay grounded during the day. The walking meditation is also a good idea since I can do that on my way to school or during a break.

I'll start with the body scan tonight and see how it goes. It might take some practice, but I'm willing to give it a shot.

As for communicating with my ex-wife, I've been trying to set regular check-ins, but sometimes things get hectic and we miss them. I'll make a more conscious effort to stick to our schedule and be clear about what I need. It's important for both of us to be on the same page, especially when it comes to the kids.

I appreciate the detailed steps you provided for both mindfulness and communication. It gives me a clear path to follow, which I think will help a lot.

Looking forward to our next session to see how these new practices are working out. Thanks again, Nova.
