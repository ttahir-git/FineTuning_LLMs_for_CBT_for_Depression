Thank you for sharing your experiences and concerns, Naomi. Let's address each of these points and develop some strategies to help you manage both your anxiety and academic stress.

### Gratitude Practice Guidelines:
1. **Start Simple:**
   - Begin with writing down 1-3 things each morning
   - They can be small things like "my warm cup of tea" or bigger things like "support from friends"
   - Try to be specific rather than general (e.g., "the way my friend checked in on me yesterday" rather than just "friends")

2. **Make it Personal:**
   - Keep a small notebook by your bed or tea spot
   - Write not just what you're grateful for, but briefly why
   - Example: "I'm grateful for my morning tea because it gives me a moment of peace before the day begins"

### Managing Mid-Afternoon Anxiety:
1. **Mini-Breaks:**
   - Set a timer for a 2-minute breathing exercise when you feel anxiety rising
   - Take a short walk around your study space
   - Do some gentle stretching at your desk

2. **Structured Work Periods:**
   - Try the Pomodoro Technique: 25 minutes of focused work followed by 5-minute breaks
   - Use these breaks for mindfulness exercises or movement
   - This can help prevent work from feeling overwhelming

### Academic Stress Management:
1. **Time Management:**
   - Break large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks
   - Create a weekly schedule that includes study time, breaks, and self-care
   - Set realistic daily goals rather than focusing on the entire workload

2. **Study Techniques:**
   - Consider incorporating mindfulness into your study routine
   - Take brief mindful pauses between subjects or tasks
   - Notice when you're getting overwhelmed and take appropriate breaks

3. **Progress Tracking:**
   - Keep a simple log of what you accomplish each day
   - Celebrate small wins and progress
   - Focus on what you've completed rather than what's still pending

### Next Steps:
1. **Morning Routine:**
   - Continue with your current routine
   - Add the gratitude practice
   - Incorporate a short yoga sequence when you feel ready

2. **Afternoon Management:**
   - Set reminders for breathing exercises during your typical anxiety spike times
   - Keep a water bottle nearby and stay hydrated
   - Plan your work in smaller chunks with regular breaks

3. **Evening Reflection:**
   - Take a few minutes before bed to reflect on your day
   - Note what worked well and what you might adjust tomorrow
   - Practice a short meditation or breathing exercise to help transition to sleep

Would you like to focus on any of these areas in particular? We can develop more specific strategies for whichever aspect you feel needs the most attention right now.

Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again. Let's dive into our session today. Given that it's your 14th CBT session, I notice you might have a good grasp of the strategies we've discussed so far. However, it's always beneficial to revisit and refine our approaches.

### Gratitude Practice
Since you mentioned starting with this, let's ensure it's a consistent part of your morning routine. How has the gratitude practice been going for you? Have you noticed any changes in your mood or perspective? If you feel ready, we could explore some additional prompts or ways to deepen your practice. For example, you might try reflecting on experiences from the previous day or imagining future positive scenarios.

### Managing Mid-Afternoon Anxiety
The mini-breaks and structured work periods seem to be helping, but how have they been working out for you? Are there any specific breathing exercises or stretches that feel particularly beneficial? We can also explore different techniques to make these breaks more effective. For instance, you might try a guided relaxation audio or a quick mindfulness exercise that you enjoy.

### Academic Stress Management
Time management and study techniques continue to be key. How have your weekly schedules been working out? Have you noticed any patterns in when you feel most stressed? We can discuss how to adjust your schedule if needed or explore additional study techniques that might be more effective for you. For instance, you might find that taking mindful pauses during study sessions significantly helps.

### Next Steps
For today, let's focus on reinforcing the gratitude practice and refining your afternoon management strategies. How do you feel about integrating a new mindfulness exercise into your mini-breaks? Perhaps a brief guided meditation could be helpful.

Would you like to start with the gratitude practice and then move on to refining your afternoon techniques, or do you have a specific area you feel needs more attention?

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to see you too. I appreciate the reminder that revisiting and refining our strategies is important.

### Gratitude Practice
The gratitude practice has been going okay. I've been writing down 1-3 things each morning, like you suggested. It's been small stuff, like "my warm cup of tea" or "the support from my friends." I haven't noticed a huge change in my mood yet, but I do feel a bit more aware of the little things that make my day better. I'm open to exploring additional prompts or ways to deepen the practice. Reflecting on experiences from the previous day sounds interesting. Maybe that could help me see more clearly what I'm grateful for.

### Managing Mid-Afternoon Anxiety
The mini-breaks and structured work periods have been helpful, but I still find myself getting anxious around 3 PM. The 2-minute breathing exercises have been the most beneficial for me. I like the idea of trying a guided relaxation audio or a quick mindfulness exercise during these breaks. Maybe something that guides me through a short meditation could be really calming.

### Academic Stress Management
My weekly schedules have been okay, but I still feel most stressed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, especially when I have back-to-back classes and deadlines. I think taking mindful pauses during study sessions could really help. It might break up the stress and give me a moment to reset

Therapist: Hi Naomi,

It's great to hear that you're finding the gratitude practice helpful and are open to exploring deeper ways to engage with it. Let's delve into some additional prompts and ways to deepen your practice.

### Gratitude Practice
#### Additional Prompts and Ways to Deepen the Practice:
1. **Reflect on Experiences:**
   - Try to reflect on positive experiences from the previous day. For example, think about a conversation you had that made you feel supported or a project you completed that you were proud of.
2. **Future Positive Scenarios:**
   - Write about something you’re looking forward to. This could be something big or small, like a future event or a goal you hope to achieve.
3. **Physical Feelings:**
   - Notice the physical sensations when you experience gratitude. For example, write about how your heart feels lighter when you think of something you’re grateful for.
4. **Journaling Prompts:**
   - Use prompts like:
     - "What small kindness did someone do for me today that I am grateful for?"
     - "What is one thing that brought me joy today, and why?"
     - "What challenge did I overcome today, and how did it make me feel?"

#### Example:
- "Today, I was grateful for my warm cup of tea in the morning because it reminded me of my grandmother’s kitchen. I was also grateful for the email from my professor, acknowledging my effort on the project. These moments brought a smile to my face and a sense of appreciation."

### Managing Mid-Afternoon Anxiety
#### Guided Relaxation Audio or Mindfulness Exercise:
1. **Guided Relaxation Audio:**
   - You can try listening to a 5-minute guided relaxation audio during your breaks. Websites like Headspace or Calm offer a variety of guided meditations specifically designed for reducing anxiety.
   - Example: "During my 3 PM break, I can play a 5-minute guided relaxation audio on my phone. This will help me calm down and focus better for the rest of the afternoon."

2. **Mindfulness Exercise:**
   - Consider a mindfulness exercise that involves focusing on your breath and bodily sensations. You can do a brief body scan meditation where you focus on different parts of your body, noticing any tension and consciously relaxing those areas.
   - Example: "During my 3 PM break, I can spend 5 minutes doing a body scan meditation. I start by focusing on my toes and slowly move up my body, noticing any tension and relaxing each part."

### Academic Stress Management
#### Adjusting Your Schedule and Mindful Pauses:
1. **Adjusting Your Schedule:**
   - Try to integrate some buffer time into your schedule, especially on stressful days like Tuesdays and Thursdays. Even small adjustments can make a big difference.
   - Example: "I can allocate 15 minutes at the end of each class to do a brief mindfulness exercise.

Patient: Thank you for the additional prompts and suggestions, Nova. I appreciate the detailed examples; they really help me understand how to apply these practices more effectively.

### Gratitude Practice
I like the idea of reflecting on positive experiences from the previous day and imagining future positive scenarios. It feels like it could add more depth to my gratitude practice. I'll try incorporating these prompts tomorrow morning and see how it feels.
