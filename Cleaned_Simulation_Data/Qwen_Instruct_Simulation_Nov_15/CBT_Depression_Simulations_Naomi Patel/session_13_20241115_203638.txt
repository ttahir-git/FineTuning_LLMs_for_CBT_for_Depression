Patient: Hi, thanks for the recap. It's been a mixed bag with the mindfulness practices. The morning ritual has been surprisingly calming—I light a candle and make tea, which sets a nice tone. But I've been struggling with the body scan. It feels a bit too abstract for me, and I find my mind wandering a lot. 

The breathing exercises are going well, though. I've been doing them every morning, and I think they help a bit with my anxiety. I haven't tried the mindful walking yet because my commute is pretty hectic, but I'll give it a shot this week.

Journaling has been interesting. I've noticed that I'm more aware of my stress triggers, like deadlines and noisy environments. But I'm not sure if it's making a huge difference yet. I'm still feeling pretty overwhelmed at times.

Do you have any suggestions for making the body scan more manageable? Maybe something more concrete or step-by-step?

Therapist: Hello Naomi,

Thank you for sharing your updates. It's good to hear that you're finding the morning ritual calming and that the breathing exercises are helping with your anxiety. Let's explore some ways to make the body scan more manageable and step-by-step.

### Enhancing the Body Scan Practice:

1. **Start with a Focus on a Specific Part of the Body:**
   - Begin by focusing on one specific part of your body at a time. Start with your toes and work your way up to your head. For example, start by closing your eyes and focusing on your toes. Notice any sensations, tensions, or feelings in this area. Breathe into these sensations and allow them to relax. Once you feel comfortable, move on to your feet, then ankles, calves, and so on.

2. **Use Guided Audio:**
   - Try using a guided audio for the body scan. There are many apps and online resources that offer guided body scans. This can be very helpful in maintaining focus and providing clear instructions. Apps like Headspace or Calm have excellent guided body scans.

3. **Incorporate Visualization:**
   - Visualize a wave of warmth or relaxation moving through your body. Imagine this wave starting at your toes and moving up through your body, relaxing each part as it passes by. This can help keep your mind focused on the process.

4. **Set a Timer:**
   - Start with a shorter time, such as 3-5 minutes, and gradually increase the duration as you get more comfortable. This helps prevent the feeling of being overwhelmed and makes the practice more manageable.

5. **Track Your Progress:**
   - Keep a note of how long you manage to stay focused and any improvements you notice. This can help you see your progress and build confidence.

### Additional Tips:

- **Mindful Breathing During the Body Scan:**
  - You can combine the body scan with mindful breathing. As you focus on each part of your body, take a few deep breaths and exhale slowly. This can help you stay present and focused.

- **Physical Comfort:**
  - Ensure that you are in a comfortable position. You can lie down, sit in a comfortable chair, or even sit on the edge of a bed with your feet on the floor. This can help reduce physical discomfort and make the practice more enjoyable.

### Next Steps:

- **Try the Guided Body Scan:**
  - Give it a try this week with a guided audio. See if this helps you stay focused and relaxed.

- **Reflect on Your Progress:**
  - Keep your journal updated with how you feel before and after the body scan. Notice if there are any changes in your stress levels or physical sensations.

- **Continue with the Breathing Exercises:**
  - Keep up the breathing exercises, as they are beneficial for managing anxiety. You can incorporate these before starting the body scan to help calm your mind.

Let.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. That was really helpful. I've been trying to stick to my morning ritual, and it's been nice to start the day with a cup of tea and some deep breaths. The noise isn't as much of an issue since I got those noise-canceling headphones. 

I've been struggling a bit with the body scan, though. It feels a bit overwhelming to focus on every part of my body all at once. The idea of starting with just one part at a time sounds much more manageable. I'll try that tomorrow morning and see how it goes.

As for journaling, it's been interesting. I notice that my anxiety levels seem a bit lower on days when I do the breathing exercises and the morning ritual. But sometimes I still feel very distracted and it's hard to concentrate on my studies. I'm not sure if that's related to the body scan practice or just the usual stress of grad school.

I'm glad you mentioned using a guided audio for the body scan. I'll definitely try that this week. Do you have any specific recommendations for guided body scan audio? I'm open to trying different apps if you think they work better.

Also, I was wondering if it would be helpful to add something physical to my morning routine, like a quick stretch or yoga. I think it might help me feel more grounded before diving into my day. What

Therapist: Hello Naomi,

I'm glad to hear that you're sticking to your morning ritual and finding it calming. That's a great start, and it’s wonderful to see you taking steps to manage your anxiety. Let's continue to refine your body scan practice and explore ways to enhance your morning routine.

### Enhancing the Body Scan Practice with Guided Audio:

- **Guided Body Scan Apps:**
  - **Headspace:** This app offers a variety of guided body scan meditations, from beginners to more advanced levels.
  - **Calm:** They also have a range of guided meditations, including body scan exercises.
  - **Simple Habit:** This app provides short and easy-to-follow guided meditations, which might be a good starting point if you prefer something more concise.

### Adding Physical Elements to Your Morning Routine:

- **Stretching or Yoga:**
  - Adding a few minutes of stretching or a short yoga routine can be very beneficial. Even a quick sequence like Sun Salutations can help you feel more grounded and centered. Many apps offer short yoga sequences that you can easily follow along with.
  - **Yoga Apps:**
    - **Down Dog:** Offers customizable yoga routines, including shorter sequences.
    - **Yoga with Adriene:** You can find short videos on her YouTube channel that are great for a quick morning stretch.

### Additional Tips for Your Morning Routine:

1. **Hydration:**
   - Start your day with a glass of water. Sometimes dehydration can contribute to feelings of fatigue and stress, and staying hydrated can help you feel more alert and focused.

2. **Mindful Listening:**
   - Consider incorporating a few minutes of mindful listening to a piece of soothing music or nature sounds. This can help you transition from a state of sleep to being present and focused.

3. **Gratitude Practice:**
   - Before diving into your day, take a moment to write down a few things you're grateful for. This can shift your mindset positively and reduce feelings of overwhelm.

### Next Steps:

- **Try the Guided Body Scan:**
  - Use a guided audio to help you focus and stay on track. This can make the practice more manageable and enjoyable.
  - Start with a 5-minute session and gradually increase the duration as you feel more comfortable.

- **Incorporate Stretching or Yoga:**
  - Add a few minutes of stretching or a short yoga sequence to your morning routine. This can help you feel more grounded and prepared to tackle your day.

- **Journaling and Reflection:**
  - Continue to journal your experiences. Notice if there are any patterns or specific situations that trigger your anxiety. This can help you identify areas where mindfulness can be particularly beneficial.

- **Mindfulness During Daily Activities:**
  - Try to incorporate mindfulness into other parts of your day. For example, focus on your breath during breaks or while doing routine tasks like making coffee.

### Final Thoughts:.

Patient: Thanks for the detailed suggestions, Nova. I'll definitely try the guided body scan from Headspace and see if that helps. I've been meaning to try yoga for a while, so I'll check out the Down Dog app and Yoga with Adriene's videos. Starting the day with a glass of water and a few minutes of mindful listening sounds like a good idea too.

I've been keeping up with my journaling, and I've noticed that my anxiety seems to spike around mid-afternoon. I think it might be related to the workload piling up and feeling like I'm not making enough progress. I'm not sure if there's anything specific I can do to address that, but maybe mindfulness can help me stay more present during those times.

I'm also curious about the gratitude practice. I've never really done that before. How exactly do you recommend I start? Should I just write down three things I'm grateful for every morning, or is there a specific way to do it?

Lastly, I've been thinking about my academic struggles. I feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up, and it's really draining. I'm not sure if this is the right place to talk about it, but I'd appreciate any advice on how to manage the stress and pressure better.
