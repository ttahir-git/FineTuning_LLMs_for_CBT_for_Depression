1. **Academic Advisor Meeting Preparation:**
   - I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful about the meeting. I've prepared a list of key points and questions, focusing on my research progress and any potential support I might need. I'm hoping it will help clarify my goals and challenges.

2. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR):**

4. **Daily Routines and Structure:**
   - My structured daily schedules have been quite helpful. They provide a sense of direction and reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. However, I sometimes struggle with sticking to them during particularly busy days.

### Insights and Realizations:
- **Sense of Control:**
  - I feel more in control

Therapist: Hi Naomi, thank you for providing such detailed updates. It’s great to hear that you’re feeling more prepared for your academic advisor meeting and that the PMR and journaling practices are beneficial for you.

### Addressing Your Updates
1. **Academic Advisor Meeting Preparation:**
   - It’s normal to feel a bit nervous about meetings, but being well-prepared can definitely help. Your focus on your research progress and areas needing support is a good approach. If there’s anything specific you’re worried about, we can work on addressing those concerns during the meeting.

2. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR):**
   - Integrating PMR into both your morning and evening routines is a fantastic strategy. It can be a great way to start and end your day feeling more relaxed. If you find that your PMR practice is particularly helpful in the morning, we might consider making it a bit longer or more focused.

3. **Mental Health Journaling:**
   - It’s insightful to track how your eating and taking breaks affect your energy and mood. This kind of mindful awareness is very helpful. If you feel you’re missing meals or not taking breaks, we can explore ways to integrate short breaks into your day, perhaps with quick activities like PMR or a short walk.

4. **Daily Routines and Structure:**
   - Feeling more direction and structure can really help reduce overwhelm. However, it’s understandable that sometimes it can be challenging to stick to routines during busy days. One way to manage this is to have a more flexible structure that allows for some variability. For example, you could have a core set of activities that must be done each day, with some time slots reserved for unexpected tasks or breaks.

### Next Steps

   - Let’s review your list of points and questions to make sure you have everything covered. If you need any help with formulating specific questions or points, I can assist you.
   
- **PMR Integration:**
   - We can explore a few more specific techniques for your PMR practice, such as focusing on different muscle groups or incorporating some gentle stretches. This can make the practice even more effective.

- **Journaling:**
   - Let’s expand your journaling to include quick notes on your eating habits and breaks. You might find it helpful to set aside a few minutes each day to write these down. This can give you a better understanding of your patterns and help you make adjustments.

- **Daily Schedule:**
   - Let’s refine your schedule to be more flexible but still provide structure. We can identify core activities that must be done daily and then allocate some time slots for flexibility, such as unexpected tasks or breaks.

### Additional Tips
- **Mindfulness and Flexibility:**
  - Mindfulness can be a helpful tool in managing unexpected events. Practicing mindfulness for a few minutes each day can help you stay present and manage your reactions to unexpected changes.

  - It’s important to present your research progress and any delays in a balanced manner. Here are a few tips:
    - **Highlight the Positive:** Start by mentioning the achievements and progress you've made.
    - **Discuss the Challenges:** Be clear and honest about any challenges or delays. Focus on what steps you're taking to address them.
    - **Show Proactivity:** Demonstrate that you're taking proactive steps to resolve any issues. For example, if you faced a setback due to unexpected data issues, explain how you've now implemented a more robust data collection method.
