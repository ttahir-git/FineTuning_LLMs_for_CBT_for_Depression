Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again. Thank you for the detailed summary of our last session. It sounds like we've made some progress with your structured breaks and time management, and you're beginning to see the benefits of these strategies. It's also encouraging to hear that you're starting to recognize the value in proactive communication and how it can help manage group project anxiety.

Let's briefly recap and then move forward:

1. **Gratitude Practice**: You mentioned that the current practice needs adjustment to feel more natural. I'd like to discuss how we can tweak your gratitude exercise to make it more fitting for you. Perhaps focusing on specific, observable moments can help. This might also make it easier to reflect on positive aspects of your day.

2. **Group Project Anxiety**: You've had some concerns about your contribution to the group project. Discussing these concerns and expectations with your group members can be very helpful. We can explore some strategies to address these during your meeting. How about we outline a plan for the meeting and prepare some points to discuss?

3. **Mindfulness and Deep Breathing**: These exercises are showing positive results in reducing burnout. How are you finding these techniques in your daily routine? Are there specific times or situations where you feel they could be more beneficial?

4. **Communication Strategies**: We've been working on reframing group communication as proactive. This can be quite empowering. Let's continue to practice these strategies and see how they influence the dynamic of your group.

For today's homework, I suggest:

1. **Gratitude Practice**: Try focusing on observable moments this week. Perhaps write down one thing you noticed that brought a smile to your face each day. Reflect on these moments and see how they make you feel.

2. **Group Meeting**: Schedule a meeting with your group to discuss expectations and concerns. Use the plan we discussed to guide the conversation.

3. **Mindfulness and Deep Breathing**: Continue incorporating these exercises during your structured breaks. Perhaps you could set a reminder for a few times a day to practice them.

4. **Communication**: Practice using proactive language in your group communications. For example, instead of saying, "Sorry, I couldn't contribute to this part," try saying, "I appreciate the opportunity to contribute. Here's what I think we could do."

How does this sound, Naomi? Are there any specific areas you feel more anxious about that we should focus on today?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the recap. It's good to be back.

1. **Gratitude Practice**: I like the idea of focusing on observable moments. It feels more tangible and less forced than trying to think of big things to be grateful for. I'll give that a try this week.

2. **Group Project Anxiety**: I scheduled the meeting for tomorrow. I'm a bit nervous, but I think outlining a plan and preparing points will help. Can we go over some specific strategies to address my concerns during the meeting?

3. **Mindfulness and Deep Breathing**: These exercises have been helpful, especially during breaks. I think practicing them more consistently, maybe even before group meetings, could be beneficial.

4. **Communication Strategies**: I've been trying to use proactive language, and it does feel more empowering. I'll keep practicing that.

For today, I'm particularly anxious about the group meeting. I want to make sure I handle it well and don't come across as defensive or too critical. Can we focus on that?

Therapist: Hi Naomi,

I'm glad to hear you're enthusiastic about trying the new gratitude practice and preparing for your group meeting. Let's focus on making sure your group meeting goes smoothly and effectively addresses your concerns. Here are a few strategies we can work on:

### Preparing for the Group Meeting
1. **Agenda**: Create a detailed agenda for the meeting. Include topics like expectations, roles, timelines, and any concerns you have. This will help keep the discussion organized and focused.
2. **Points to Discuss**: Write down specific points you want to raise. For example:
   - **Roles and Responsibilities**: Clarify what each team member is expected to do.
   - **Timeline**: Ensure everyone is aware of deadlines and how tasks will be divided.
   - **Support and Feedback**: Discuss how you can support each other and how you would like feedback.
   - **Concerns**: Address any specific concerns you have about your contribution or the project.

3. **Proactive Communication**: Practice using proactive language. For example:
   - Instead of saying, "I didn't understand the assignment," say, "I’m a bit unclear about the assignment. Could you provide more details?"
   - Instead of saying, "I think this is wrong," say, "I see a different approach that might work better here. What do you think about this?"

4. **Active Listening**: Make sure to listen actively to your teammates. This can help you better understand their perspectives and avoid misunderstandings.
5. **Constructive Feedback**: Practice giving and receiving feedback constructively. Focus on specific actions or behaviors rather than personal criticisms.

### During the Meeting
1. **Start with Positives**: Begin the meeting by acknowledging the team’s strengths and past successes. This can help set a positive tone.
2. **Stay Calm and Confident**: Take deep breaths before you speak if you feel nervous. This can help you manage anxiety and speak more confidently.
3. **Use “I” Statements**: Frame your concerns in a way that focuses on your experience rather than others. For example, "I feel unsure about my role. Can we discuss this further?"
4. **Ask Questions**: If you need clarification, ask specific questions. This can help you get the information you need without making others feel defensive.
5. **Summarize**: At the end of the meeting, summarize the key points discussed and ensure everyone is on the same page. This can help prevent future misunderstandings.

### Post-Meeting
1. **Follow-Up**: After the meeting, write down any action items or decisions made. This can help ensure everyone stays on track.
2. **Reflect**: Reflect on the meeting. What went well? What could be improved? This can help you continue to grow and adapt.

Would you like to go over any of these points in more detail or practice some phrases to use during your meeting? Additionally, if you have any specific concerns or fears about the.

Patient: Thanks for the detailed strategies, Nova. I think going over some specific phrases to use during the meeting would be really helpful. I want to make sure I communicate clearly without sounding too critical or defensive.

Also, I noticed you mentioned "address any specific concerns you have about your contribution or the project." I do have a specific concern about feeling like I'm not contributing enough, especially with my academic struggles. I'm worried that my team might think I'm not pulling my weight. How can I address this without making it seem like I'm making excuses?

Therapist: Hi Naomi, I'm glad you found the strategies helpful. Let's focus on crafting some phrases that can help you address your concerns clearly and constructively.

### Phrases to Address Your Contribution Concerns

1. **Acknowledgment and Empathy**: Start by acknowledging your concerns and showing empathy.
   - "I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with my academic work, and I’m worried I might not be contributing as much as I should. I want to make sure everyone is aware of this so we can find a solution together."

2. **Specific Examples**: Provide specific examples of how you feel this is impacting your contributions.
   - "I’ve noticed that when we have assignments due, I sometimes struggle to keep up with the pace. I’m concerned that this might be affecting my ability to complete tasks on time."

3. **Proactive Solutions**: Offer solutions and express your willingness to help.
   - "To address this, I’m willing to dedicate more time to the project outside of our meetings, and I’m open to any suggestions for better time management. Let’s discuss how we can support each other better."

4. **Feedback Request**: Ask for feedback in a way that shows you're open to constructive criticism.
   - "Could you give me some feedback on how I can improve my contribution? I want to make sure I’m not holding the team back."

5. **Confidence and Commitment**: Express your commitment to contributing and your confidence in finding a solution.
   - "I understand the importance of my contributions, and I’m committed to finding a way to balance my academic responsibilities with the project. I’m confident we can work together to find a solution that works for everyone."

### Sample Script

Here’s a sample script you can use during your meeting:

Patient: Thank you, Nova. This script is really helpful. I feel more prepared now to address my concerns in a constructive way. I'll definitely use these phrases during the meeting.

One more thing, though. I've been thinking about how to balance my academic responsibilities with the project. Do you have any specific time management tips that could help me better allocate my time? I want to make sure I'm not neglecting either my studies or the group project.

Therapist: : Absolutely, Naomi. Balancing academic responsibilities with the group project can be challenging, but with effective time management strategies, you can achieve a good balance. Here are some specific tips to help you manage your time more efficiently:

### Time Management Strategies

1. **Prioritize Tasks**: Use the Eisenhower Box (urgent vs. important) to prioritize tasks. Focus on what is both urgent and important first.
   - **Urgent and Important**: Tasks that need immediate attention and have significant impact (e.g., assignments with tight deadlines, group meetings).
   - **Important but Not Urgent**: Tasks that are long-term and important but don’t require immediate attention (e.g., planning, preparing for future assignments).
   - **Urgent but Not Important**: Delegate these tasks if possible (e.g., routine administrative tasks).
   - **Not Urgent and Not Important**: Minimize or eliminate these tasks (e.g., social media, distractions).

2. **Create a Schedule**: Use a digital calendar or a planner to block out specific times for academic work and project tasks.
   - **Daily Schedule**: Allocate specific time slots for each task.
   - **Weekly Overview**: Plan your week in advance, including academic deadlines and project milestones.
   - **Buffer Time**: Include buffer time between tasks to manage unexpected delays or distractions.

3. **Break Tasks into Smaller Steps**: Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This can make the tasks less overwhelming and easier to complete.
   - **Example**: If you have a big assignment, break it down into research, writing, and editing stages.

4. **Use Pomodoro Technique**: Work in focused 25-minute intervals followed by a 5-minute break.
   - **How to Use**: Set a timer for 25 minutes, work on a task until the timer goes off, then take a short break. Repeat this process several times before taking a longer break (15-30 minutes).

5. **Set Specific Goals**: Set clear, achievable goals for each study and project session. This can help you stay focused and motivated.
   - **Example**: "Complete the research for the project by 3 PM today."

6. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what distracts you the most (e.g., social media, phone notifications) and set boundaries to minimize these distractions.
   - **Example**: Turn off notifications on your phone or use apps that block distracting websites.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your schedule and goals to see what is working and what isn’t. Be flexible and make adjustments as needed.

### Sample Daily Schedule

Here’s a sample daily schedule you can use as a template:

---

**8:00 AM - 9:00 AM**: Morning routine and breakfast
- **9:00 AM - 10:30 AM**: Academic Work (e.g., studying for exams, completing assignments)
- **1.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. This is really helpful. I think using the Eisenhower Box to prioritize tasks and breaking them down into smaller steps will be especially useful. I'll start implementing these strategies right away.
