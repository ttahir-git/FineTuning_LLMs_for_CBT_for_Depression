Therapist: : Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again. It sounds like we've been making some positive strides in managing your mid-afternoon anxiety and other stressors. Let's pick up where we left off and see how you're doing with the techniques we've been working on.

1. **Gratitude Practice**: How has your deeper reflection on gratitude been going? Have you noticed any changes in your mood or perspective since incorporating new prompts? It can be helpful to reflect on what you're grateful for multiple times a day, even if it's just a short thought.

2. **Mid-Afternoon Anxiety**: How's your experience with the 5-minute guided relaxation at 3 PM? Have you noticed any difference in your anxiety levels since implementing this? If you find it helpful, maybe we can adjust the prompts or techniques to better suit your needs.

3. **Academic Stress Management**: Any updates on how you've been handling your academic pressures? It might be useful to review any specific techniques that have been beneficial and perhaps explore some additional strategies if needed.

4. **Guided Relaxation Techniques**: How have the 5-Point Breathing exercise and Body Scan Meditation been for you? Have you found any particular ones to be more effective? It's great to hear that you're using the app consistently; any insights on which sessions you find most helpful?

5. **Progress Monitoring**: How have you been keeping track of your progress through your journal? It can be very informative to review this data and see how your anxiety levels are changing over time.

6. **New Insights**: What new realizations or insights have you had since our last session? It's important to continue reflecting on your experiences and the effectiveness of the techniques we're using.

Let's discuss these points and see how we can refine our approach further to best support you.

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to see you too. Let's dive into these points.

1. **Gratitude Practice**: I've been trying to incorporate deeper reflection with the new prompts, and it's been interesting. I've noticed that when I focus more on specific aspects of what I'm grateful for, like the support from my sister or the beauty of the Berkeley campus, it does lift my mood a bit. I've started doing it not just in the morning but also before bed, which helps me wind down.

2. **Mid-Afternoon Anxiety**: The 5-minute guided relaxation at 3 PM has been a game-changer. I feel like I can actually get through that slump without it spiraling into a full-blown anxiety attack. I've been using the "Calm" session on the Headspace app, and it really helps to just take that break and breathe.

3. **Academic Stress Management**: I've been trying to build in more buffer time between classes and assignments, which has helped a lot. I've also started using the 2-minute breathing exercises before diving into my work, and it's made a noticeable difference in my focus.

4. **Guided Relaxation Techniques**: The 5-Point Breathing exercise has been really effective for me. It's quick and easy to do anywhere, which is great. The Body

Therapist: Great to hear that you're seeing positive changes, Naomi! Let's continue building on these successes and make some adjustments where needed.

1. **Gratitude Practice**: It's wonderful to hear that you're finding deeper reflection and new prompts helpful. Continuing to explore specific aspects of what you're grateful for can indeed enhance your mood and overall well-being. Maybe we can brainstorm a few more prompts that resonate with you personally. For example, you could focus on the positive interactions you had throughout the day, or even small things like enjoying your lunch or a good cup of coffee. This can help sustain the positive mood throughout the day.

2. **Mid-Afternoon Anxiety**: The 5-minute guided relaxation during your mid-afternoon slump sounds like a great strategy. Keep up with the "Calm" session on Headspace; it's wonderful that you've found a technique that works for you. You might also consider adding a brief mindful moment before the session. For instance, take a moment to pause, close your eyes, and notice the sensations in your body, and then gently transition into the guided relaxation. This can help you fully engage with the session.

3. **Academic Stress Management**: It's fantastic to hear that building in buffer time and using 2-minute breathing exercises are making a difference. You might also consider incorporating brief, mindful pauses between tasks. For example, take a 1-minute break after every hour of focused study. Use this time to stretch, do a quick breathing exercise, or step outside for some fresh air. This can help maintain your energy and focus over longer periods.

4. **Guided Relaxation Techniques**: The 5-Point Breathing exercise is indeed quick and effective. You might find it helpful to combine this with a short mindful moment as well. For example, focus on your breath for 30 seconds, then move into the breathing exercise. Additionally, you could explore the Body Scan Meditation for more prolonged relaxation. Sometimes, focusing on different parts of your body can help you fully relax and de-stress.

5. **Progress Monitoring**: Keep up with your journaling! It's a valuable tool for tracking your progress and identifying any patterns or challenges. Reflecting on what works and what doesn’t can provide insights into what you might need to adjust. Maybe you could add a section in your journal to note how you felt before and after your relaxation sessions, or how you managed to stay calm during stressful situations.

6. **New Insights**: Have you noticed any specific triggers or patterns that contribute to your anxiety? Sometimes, identifying these patterns can help you develop more targeted strategies. For instance, if you find that certain types of assignments or topics trigger your anxiety, you might work on specific coping techniques for those situations.

Let's continue to refine these strategies and see how we can make them even more effective for you.

Patient: Thanks for the additional tips, Nova. Let's go over a few more things.

1. **Gratitude Practice**: I like the idea of focusing on positive interactions and small pleasures throughout the day. It feels more manageable and less overwhelming than trying to think of big things to be grateful for. I'll definitely try that.

2. **Mid-Afternoon Anxiety**: Adding a mindful moment before the guided relaxation sounds like a good way to transition into it more smoothly. I'll give that a shot.

3. **Academic Stress Management**: I hadn't thought about taking mindful pauses between tasks, but it makes sense. I'll start doing that to see if it helps me stay more focused and less burnt out.

4. **Guided Relaxation Techniques**: Combining the 5-Point Breathing with a short mindful moment sounds like a good way to make it even more effective. I'll also try the Body Scan Meditation more regularly.

5. **Progress Monitoring**: I've been noting down how I feel before and after my relaxation sessions, and it's been helpful to see the difference. I'll add more details about how I manage stress during specific situations.

6. **New Insights**: I've noticed that group projects tend to trigger my anxiety more than individual assignments. I think it's because there's more pressure to coordinate and communicate effectively. I'll need to

Therapist: : Great, Naomi, I'm glad you find these additional strategies useful. Let's continue to explore ways to manage your anxiety, especially in high-stress situations like group projects.

1. **Gratitude Practice**: It's wonderful to hear that you're finding the smaller, more manageable aspects of gratitude more approachable. This can help you maintain a positive outlook and reduce overwhelm. Maybe you can also consider setting aside a specific time each week to reflect on the broader things you're grateful for, as a way to balance out the day-to-day reflections.

2. **Mid-Afternoon Anxiety**: The mindful moment before guided relaxation is a great addition. Sometimes, just taking a few deep breaths and focusing on the present can make a big difference. You could also consider adding a brief visualization during your guided relaxation, imagining a peaceful place or a calm scene. This can enhance the relaxation experience.

3. **Academic Stress Management**: Taking mindful pauses can definitely help you maintain focus and avoid burnout. Try to integrate these breaks into your study routine consistently. You might also find it helpful to use a timer to remind yourself to take these breaks at regular intervals.

4. **Guided Relaxation Techniques**: Combining the 5-Point Breathing with a short mindful moment is a great approach. You could also experiment with different types of Body Scan Meditations. Some people find it helpful to start with focusing on a specific area, like their feet, and gradually move up, while others prefer a more comprehensive scan. See which method resonates better with you.

5. **Progress Monitoring**: Keeping detailed notes on how you manage stress during specific situations, like group projects, can provide valuable insights. Consider noting down what worked and what didn't, as well as any patterns or triggers you identify. This can help you develop more targeted coping strategies.

6. **New Insights**: It's good to identify specific triggers, like group projects, as it allows you to prepare better. For group projects, you might consider breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks and setting clear goals for each member. Communication is key, so make sure to schedule regular check-ins and establish roles and responsibilities early on.

Let's also discuss any additional support or resources you might need. Sometimes, it can be helpful to talk about your experiences with someone you trust, like a friend or mentor. If you feel comfortable, we can explore ways to incorporate group support or peer mentoring into your stress management plan.

How do you feel about these suggestions, and are there any other areas you'd like to work on further?

Patient: Thanks for the additional suggestions, Nova. Let's go over them.

1. **Gratitude Practice**: I like the idea of setting aside a specific time each week to reflect on broader things I'm grateful for. It can help me see the bigger picture and not just focus on daily minutiae.

2. **Mid-Afternoon Anxiety**: Adding visualization during guided relaxation sounds interesting. I'll try imagining a peaceful place, like a quiet beach or a serene forest, to see if it enhances the relaxation.

3. **Academic Stress Management**: Using a timer to remind myself to take breaks is a practical idea. I'll set it for every hour to ensure I'm not overworking myself.

4. **Guided Relaxation Techniques**: I'll experiment with different Body Scan Meditation methods to see which one feels better. Starting with my feet and gradually moving up sounds like a good approach to try.

5. **Progress Monitoring**: I'll keep detailed notes on how I handle group projects and other specific stressors. It'll be helpful to see what strategies work best for different situations.

6. **New Insights**: Breaking down group projects into smaller tasks and setting clear goals for each member is a solid plan. I'll make sure to communicate effectively and schedule regular check-ins to keep everyone on track.

As for additional support, I've been leaning on my LGBTQ+ support

Therapist: That's great to hear that you have a supportive network, Naomi. Leveraging your LGBTQ+ support system can be incredibly beneficial. They can provide emotional support and understanding, which can be crucial during stressful times. Here are a few additional points to consider:

1. **Gratitude Practice**: Setting aside a specific time each week to reflect on broader aspects of gratitude can indeed provide a broader perspective. Consider setting a recurring reminder in your phone to ensure you don't forget. You might also find it helpful to discuss your gratitude reflections with your support network; sharing your thoughts can enhance your experience and make it more meaningful.

2. **Mid-Afternoon Anxiety**: Visualization during guided relaxation is a powerful tool. Try different peaceful places or scenarios to see what resonates most with you. This can make the relaxation sessions more personalized and effective.

3. **Academic Stress Management**: Using a timer to remind yourself to take breaks is a great strategy. Additionally, you might consider using apps or tools designed to help with time management and task organization. This can help you stay on top of your work and reduce anxiety.

4. **Guided Relaxation Techniques**: Experimenting with different Body Scan Meditation methods is a good approach. You might also try progressive muscle relaxation, which involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups. This can be a powerful way to release physical tension and reduce stress.

5. **Progress Monitoring**: Keeping detailed notes on how you handle group projects and other specific stressors is crucial. Consider using a structured format, such as a table or a simple checklist, to track your progress and note any strategies that work well. This can help you build a comprehensive strategy for managing stress.

6. **New Insights**: Breaking down group projects into smaller tasks and setting clear goals is a smart plan. Make sure to establish clear roles and responsibilities early on. You might also consider using a collaborative tool, like Google Docs or Trello, to keep everyone informed and on the same page.

7. **Additional Support**: Your LGBTQ+ support system is a valuable resource. Consider also discussing your academic challenges with them. They can provide additional emotional support and perhaps even offer practical tips based on their own experiences.

8. **Self-Care**: Make sure to include time for self-care in your weekly routine. This could be anything from reading a book to engaging in a hobby. Prioritizing self-care is essential for maintaining overall well-being.

How do these suggestions sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add or work on further?

Patient: I appreciate the detailed suggestions, Nova. Setting aside a specific time each week for broader gratitude reflections sounds really helpful, especially with a recurring reminder on my phone. I've been meaning to be more consistent with that.

For the mid-afternoon anxiety, I'll definitely try more visualization during my guided relaxation. I've found imagining a quiet beach helps me, so I'll stick with that and maybe try some additional peaceful settings.

Using a timer for study breaks is a great idea. I tend to lose track of time when I'm deep into my research, so this will help me stay balanced. I already use some time management apps, but I might explore more to see if there's anything better suited for my needs.

I'll experiment with progressive muscle relaxation along with the body scan meditations. I haven't tried that before, so it might be a good addition to my stress relief toolkit.

Keeping detailed notes on my progress and especially with group projects is something I'm committed to. It's been eye-opening to see how certain strategies work or don't, so I'll keep refining my approach.

Engaging more with my LGBTQ+ community for academic support is something I hadn't thought of before. It could be really beneficial. I'll reach out to see if there are any specific groups or resources focused on academic challenges within the community.
