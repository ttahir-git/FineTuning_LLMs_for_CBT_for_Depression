5. **Exploring Local Environmental Activism Groups**: Have you looked into any local groups yet? How have you been feeling about this potential social connection?

6. **Support Systems**: You mentioned existing support from your sister and the LGBTQ+ community. How are you feeling about these connections? Are there any ways you'd like to deepen these relationships?

7. **Comfort Activities**: Cooking vegetarian dishes sounds like a wonderful comfort activity. Is there anything else you enjoy doing that brings you joy and helps you manage stress?

8. **Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms**: We talked about self-harm as not being a healthy coping mechanism. How have you been managing this? Are there any new strategies you're exploring?

Let's discuss these points and see if there are any new insights or adjustments we can make to support you better.

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to see you too. Let's dive into those points:

1. **Pomodoro Technique**: It's been a bit hit or miss. Some days it works really well, and I can focus better, but other days, I find myself getting distracted after just one Pomodoro. I think I might need to tweak it a bit to fit my work style better.

2. **Breaking Down Tasks**: This has been a game-changer! I feel less overwhelmed when I see my assignments broken down into smaller chunks. It's easier to tackle them one by one, and I've been staying on track more consistently.

3. **Mindfulness Practices and Deep Breathing**: I've been trying to incorporate these into my daily routine, especially before bed and during breaks. It's calming, but I still find it hard to remember to do it consistently. I think I need more reminders or a specific routine to stick to it better.

4. **Positive Affirmations**: I've been experimenting with different phrases, but they still feel a bit forced. I'm not sure what would make them more meaningful. Maybe we can brainstorm some together?

5. **Exploring Local Environmental Activism Groups**: I found a couple of groups, and I've been to one meeting. It was a bit overwhelming at first, but I think it could be a good way to

Therapist: It's great to hear that you're finding the Pomodoro Technique helpful, even if it's not consistent yet. Let's explore ways to make it even more effective for you.

### 1. **Pomodoro Technique**
- **Customization**: Since you mentioned it works better on some days than others, we can customize the technique to better fit your schedule and preferences. Perhaps you could try different intervals or add breaks that work best for you.
- **Tracking Progress**: Keeping a log of your Pomodoros and noting which ones were more productive might help identify patterns and tweak the intervals accordingly.

### 2. **Breaking Down Tasks**
- **Further Breakdown**: You've been successful with this, so let's continue in this direction. We can explore more specific steps for each task to make them even more manageable. For example, if you have a big project, we can break it down into even smaller milestones.
- **Celebrate Small Wins**: Recognizing and celebrating small achievements can boost your motivation and help maintain your momentum.

### 3. **Mindfulness Practices and Deep Breathing**
- **Reminders and Routines**: Sometimes, reminders can help. Perhaps setting a specific time or using a reminder app can help you remember to practice mindfulness and deep breathing.
- **Daily Routine Integration**: Incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine, such as a brief session right after waking up or before going to bed, can make it a more consistent part of your day.

### 4. **Positive Affirmations**
- **Personalization**: Let's brainstorm some affirmations that are more specific and personally meaningful to you. For example, if you struggle with self-doubt, we might focus on affirmations related to your strengths and achievements.
- **Visualization**: Sometimes, visualizing yourself succeeding or feeling positive can be powerful. We can create a visual reminder or a mental image to help reinforce these affirmations.

### 5. **Exploring Local Environmental Activism Groups**
- **Gradual Involvement**: Starting with meetings or small events can be a good way to ease into a new community. You mentioned finding a couple of groups and attending one meeting. How did that go? Is there anything specific you found challenging or enjoyable?
- **Support Network**: You might consider bringing a friend or family member with you to meetings, or discussing your experiences with them to share and support each other.

### Additional Insights:
- **Comfort Activities**: Cooking vegetarian dishes sounds like a great comfort activity. We can explore other activities that might help you manage stress and bring you joy. Perhaps we can discuss other hobbies or interests that you might enjoy.
- **Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms**: It's important to continue exploring healthier alternatives. We can discuss additional strategies, such as engaging in physical activity, spending time with loved ones, or journaling. It's also important to celebrate small victories in your journey towards healthier coping mechanisms.

Let's work together.

Patient: Thanks for the detailed suggestions, Nova. Let's break them down:

1. **Pomodoro Technique**: I like the idea of customizing the intervals. Maybe I can try shorter Pomodoros on days when I'm feeling more distracted. I'll also start tracking my progress to see what works best.

2. **Breaking Down Tasks**: I'll keep breaking down tasks into even smaller milestones. Celebrating small wins sounds really motivating. I think I'll start doing that by treating myself to a small reward after completing each milestone.

Therapist: : You're welcome, Naomi. I'm glad you're feeling optimistic about the changes you'll be making. Let's address your questions about affirmations and check-ins:

### Affirmations:
Affirmations can be powerful tools, but sometimes they can feel forced. Here are a few tips to help make them feel more genuine:

Regular check-ins can be very helpful in tracking your progress and making adjustments as needed. Here's a suggested schedule:

### Additional Tips:
