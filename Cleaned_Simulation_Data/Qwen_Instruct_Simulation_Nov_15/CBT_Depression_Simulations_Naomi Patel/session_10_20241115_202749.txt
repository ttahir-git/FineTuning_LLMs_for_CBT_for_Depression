1. **Preparation for Meeting with Academic Advisor**: How has your preparation for this meeting progressed? Have you drafted your email, and if so, how has it gone? Is there anything specific you feel unsure about or need help with?

2. **Email Drafting and Review**: I noticed you've been using the email template we created. How is your communication with the academic advisor going? Are there any updates or new points you need to include in your email?

3. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)**: How often have you been practicing PMR this week? Do you find it helpful in managing your anxiety before important meetings or other stressful situations? Is there anything you're finding particularly challenging about the technique?

Let's work together to address any new challenges and build on the progress you've made.

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to see you too. I appreciate the detailed questionsâ€”it helps me organize my thoughts.

1. **Preparation for Meeting with Academic Advisor**: I did draft the email, and it went pretty well. I used the template we created, which made it much less daunting. I sent it off, and I'm waiting for a response. I'm a bit nervous about the meeting itself, though. I'm not sure if I've covered everything I need to discuss.

3. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)**: I've been practicing PMR almost every day. It's been really helpful, especially before bed. I haven't used it before a stressful situation yet, but I plan to try it before the meeting with my advisor. The only challenge I've faced is remembering to do it consistently, but I'm getting better at setting reminders.

4. **Mental Health Journal**: Journaling has been surprisingly useful. I've noticed that I tend to feel overwhelmed when I haven't taken breaks or when I'm not eating well. I'd like to focus more on tracking my energy levels and how different activities affect them.

5. **Homework Completion**: Overall, I feel good about the homework tasks. The email was a success, and I've been consistent with PMR and journaling. The only barrier has been finding

Therapist: Hi Naomi,

Thank you for your thoughtful responses. It's great to hear that you've made progress in preparing for your meeting with the academic advisor and that you've found the PMR technique helpful. Let's dive a bit deeper into these areas and address any new concerns.

1. **Preparation for Meeting with Academic Advisor**: It's important to ensure you cover all your points effectively during the meeting. If you're feeling uncertain, perhaps we can go through a few key points again and practice how you might respond to potential questions or concerns. This can help build your confidence. Additionally, consider having some notes or an outline prepared to keep things organized.

3. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)**: Consistency is key with PMR. Setting reminders and having a routine can help. You might find it helpful to also practice PMR right before the meeting to calm your nerves. If you're still struggling with consistency, let's explore some additional strategies to help you stick with the routine.

4. **Mental Health Journal**: Tracking your energy levels and how different activities affect them is a great idea. You might find it useful to include specific activities and how they make you feel both physically and emotionally. This can help you identify patterns and make informed decisions about how to manage your energy better. We can also set some specific goals for what you want to track in your journal.

5. **Homework Completion**: It's great that you've been consistent with PMR and journaling, and the email was a success. To address any remaining barriers, let's think about ways to integrate these practices into your daily routine seamlessly. Perhaps we can discuss setting up a structured daily schedule that includes time for journaling and PMR.

6. **Insights and Realizations**: Reflecting on our last session, it seems you've made significant progress in managing your anxiety and organizing your tasks. Keep noting your insights and any new areas of concern. If you have any specific triggers or challenges that have emerged, we can work on those together.

Let's schedule a quick reminder to review your notes or any concerns you might have before your meeting. We can also set some specific goals for this week regarding your journaling and PMR practice. This will help you continue to build on your successes and address any new challenges that come up.

Looking forward to our next session and seeing how you're doing!

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the detailed plan.

1. **Preparation for Meeting with Academic Advisor**: That sounds helpful. I do have some notes, but I'm worried about forgetting them during the meeting. Maybe practicing with you could help me feel more confident. I'll prepare a list of key points and potential questions to review before our next session.

3. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)**: I agree, practicing PMR before the meeting could really help. I'll set a reminder for that. I think the main challenge with consistency is just remembering to do it, especially when I'm busy. Maybe integrating it into my morning routine could help?

4. **Mental Health Journal**: I like the idea of tracking specific activities and their effects on my energy levels. I'll start noting down what I do each day and how I feel afterward. Setting goals for what to track sounds useful. I'd like to focus on how different foods and exercise impact my mood and energy.

5. **Homework Completion**: Integrating these practices into my daily routine sounds like a good idea. I'll try to set aside specific times for journaling and PMR. Maybe I can use a planner to schedule these activities.

6. **Insights and Realizations**: I've noticed that I feel more in control when I have a structured plan. The journaling and PMR have definitely helped
