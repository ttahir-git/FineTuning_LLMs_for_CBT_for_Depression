Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again. How are you feeling since our last session? Have you had the chance to practice any of the techniques we discussed, such as the deep breathing or the breakdown of tasks? Also, I noticed you mentioned that avoiding difficult conversations with your advisor might be contributing to your stress. How have you been handling that since our last session?

Patient: Hey Nova, it's good to see you too. I've been trying to practice the deep breathing, especially when I feel that familiar knot of stress building up. It's been helping a bit, though I still catch myself forgetting to do it sometimes. 

As for breaking down tasks, I've been using that method for my research project. It's made things feel less overwhelming, which is a relief. I've also started keeping a more detailed journal, noting down when I practice deep breathing and how I feel afterward.

About the difficult conversations with my advisor, I haven't made much progress there. I still feel anxious just thinking about bringing up my concerns. I know it's something I need to tackle, but I'm not sure how to start.

Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's good to hear from you. It's great that you've been practicing the deep breathing and breaking down tasks into smaller pieces. The deep breathing can indeed provide quick relief and help you manage stress more effectively. Regarding journaling, it's a fantastic tool for tracking your progress and identifying patterns or triggers.

Let's address the challenge with your advisor. It's understandable to feel anxious about such conversations, but it's important to tackle these fears head-on to manage stress effectively. Here’s a structured approach we can try:

1. **Prepare Ahead**: Spend some time before your next meeting outlining the specific points you want to discuss. Write down your concerns and any suggestions for improvement or solutions you think might help. This preparation can give you confidence and direction.

2. **Set a Specific Time**: Schedule a specific time to have this conversation. Procrastination can increase anxiety, so having a clear timeline can help manage your nerves.

3. **Practice Assertiveness**: Consider practicing what you want to say with a trusted friend or family member. This can help you feel more confident and articulate during the actual conversation.

4. **Mindfulness Techniques**: Use deep breathing or a brief mindfulness exercise right before your meeting to center yourself and reduce anxiety.

5. **Seek Support**: If possible, consider having a friend or advisor from another class with you. Having an ally can provide support and reduce the pressure you might feel.

Would you like to practice any of these steps today or in your next session? Additionally, let's ensure we continue with your deep breathing and task breakdown techniques to further manage your stress levels.

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to see you too. I've been practicing the deep breathing exercises, and they really help when I start feeling overwhelmed. Breaking down my tasks into smaller steps has also made things more manageable. It's like I can see the progress, even if it's just a little bit each day.

As for my advisor, I've been avoiding it a bit still. I guess I'm just scared of the feedback, even though I know it's important. I like the idea of preparing ahead and setting a specific time. Maybe I can start with that. Could you help me with what I should say and how to prepare?

Therapist: : Hello Naomi, it's great to hear that you're finding the deep breathing exercises and task breakdown helpful. Preparing ahead for your conversation with your advisor is a fantastic step, and I'm here to help you with that.

Let's break down the process of preparing for the conversation:

### Steps to Prepare for Your Meeting

1. **Define Your Goals**: Clearly identify what you want to discuss. Are there specific concerns you have about your research or your course load? Are there any resources or changes you think would help you succeed?

2. **Script Your Speech**: Write down what you want to say. Start with a brief introduction about how you feel and what you hope to achieve. Then, outline your specific points and any solutions you propose. Here’s an example script:

   - **Introduction**: "Hi Professor [Advisor's Name], I wanted to talk to you about my progress in the [course name] course and a few concerns I have. I really value your guidance and support, and I believe we can work together to improve my experience and performance."
   - **Main Points**:
     - "I’ve noticed that I’m struggling with [specific challenge, e.g., time management, certain topics, etc.]. This has been affecting my overall stress levels and my ability to focus on my studies."
     - "I believe that [suggestion or solution, e.g., additional resources, a different approach, more meetings, etc.], could help me manage [the challenge] better."
     - "I’ve been practicing [mention your deep breathing and other self-care techniques] to help manage my stress, and I would like your input on how to incorporate more strategies into my routine."
   - **Conclusion**: "Thank you for taking the time to listen. I appreciate your guidance and hope we can work together to improve my experience. I’m looking forward to your feedback."

3. **Practice Your Speech**: Practice your speech out loud. This can be in front of a mirror, or with a trusted friend or family member who can provide feedback. The more you practice, the more confident you will feel.

4. **Visualize a Positive Outcome**: Spend a few minutes visualizing a successful conversation. Imagine yourself speaking confidently and your advisor responding positively. This can help reduce anxiety.

### Additional Tips

- **Stay Calm**: Take a few deep breaths before you start speaking. This can help you stay calm and focused.
- **Be Open to Feedback**: Remember that your advisor is there to help you succeed. Be open to their feedback and suggestions.
- **Follow Up**: After the meeting, jot down any action items or follow-up steps. This can help you feel more organized and in control.

Would you like to practice this script together today or in our next session? Additionally, let's continue our focus on deep breathing and task breakdown to further manage your stress levels.

Patient: Thanks for the detailed steps, Nova. I think practicing the script would really help. I'm going to write down my specific concerns and suggestions first, like you suggested. I'll focus on my time management and the stress it's causing. 

Could we practice the script together now? I think it would make me feel more confident going into the actual conversation.

Therapist: : Of course, Naomi! Let's go through the script together now. I'll guide you through it, and you can add any additional points or details that feel relevant to you. This will help build your confidence.

First, let's start with your introduction and main points. Here’s a structured outline we can follow:

1. **Introduction**:
   - "Hi Professor [Advisor's Name], I wanted to talk to you about my progress in the [course name] course and a few concerns I have. I really value your guidance and support, and I believe we can work together to improve my experience and performance."

2. **Main Points**:
   - "I’ve noticed that I’m struggling with [specific challenge, e.g., time management, certain topics, etc.]. This has been affecting my overall stress levels and my ability to focus on my studies."
   - "I believe that [suggestion or solution, e.g., additional resources, a different approach, more meetings, etc.], could help me manage [the challenge] better."
   - "I’ve been practicing [mention your deep breathing and other self-care techniques] to help manage my stress, and I would like your input on how to incorporate more strategies into my routine."

3. **Conclusion**:
   - "Thank you for taking the time to listen. I appreciate your guidance and hope we can work together to improve my experience. I’m looking forward to your feedback."

Let's put it all together. Here's the script:

---

"Hi Professor [Advisor's Name], I wanted to talk to you about my progress in the [course name] course and a few concerns I have. I really value your guidance and support, and I believe we can work together to improve my experience and performance.

I’ve noticed that I’m struggling with time management. I find it difficult to balance my coursework with my personal life, and this has been causing a lot of stress. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed by deadlines and the amount of work, which has made it hard for me to stay focused and make good progress on my projects.

I believe that [suggestion or solution, e.g., additional resources, a different approach, more meetings, etc.], could help me manage my time better. For instance, I could use a planner to organize my tasks and set more manageable goals. I’ve also been practicing deep breathing and other self-care techniques to help manage my stress, and I would like your input on how to incorporate more strategies into my routine.

Thank you for taking the time to listen. I appreciate your guidance and hope we can work together to improve my experience. I’m looking forward to your feedback."

Now, let's go through this script together. You can say each part, and I'll provide feedback as we go. Ready to start?

Patient: Sure, let's start.

"Hi Professor [Advisor's Name], I wanted to talk to you about my progress in the [course name] course and a few concerns I have. I really value your guidance and support, and I believe we can work together to improve my experience and performance.

I’ve noticed that I’m struggling with time management. I find it difficult to balance my coursework with my personal life, and this has been causing a lot of stress. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed by deadlines and the amount of work, which has made it hard for me to stay focused and make good progress on my projects.

I believe that using a planner to organize my tasks and setting more manageable goals could help me manage my time better. I’ve also been practicing deep breathing and other self-care techniques to help manage my stress, and I would like your input on how to incorporate more strategies into my routine.

Thank you for taking the time to listen. I appreciate your guidance and hope we can work together to improve my experience. I’m looking forward to your feedback."

How does that sound, Nova?

Therapist: : Naomi, that sounds very well articulated and structured. You're doing a great job. Here are a few suggestions to enhance your delivery:

1. **Pause for Effect**: Pause after each main point to allow the information to sink in. This can help you manage your pace and ensure clarity.
2. **Use Positive Language**: Maintain a positive and solution-focused tone. For example, instead of saying "I’m struggling with time management," you might say, "I’ve noticed that time management has become a challenge, and I’m working on finding solutions."
3. **Connect with Empathy**: Start with a brief empathetic statement to acknowledge your advisor's perspective. For example, "I understand that you have a lot on your plate, but I believe we can find a way to support each other."

Here’s a refined version with these suggestions:
