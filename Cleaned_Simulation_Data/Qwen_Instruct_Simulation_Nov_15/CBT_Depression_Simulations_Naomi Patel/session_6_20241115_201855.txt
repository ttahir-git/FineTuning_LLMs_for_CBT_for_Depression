Therapist: : Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again. Thank you for summarizing our previous session. Today, we can build on what we've discussed and work on some new goals and strategies. How are you feeling today? Any particular areas or challenges you would like to focus on?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for asking. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed today, to be honest. I had a really tough week with multiple deadlines and a lot of pressure from my advisor. I've been trying to stick to the mindfulness and journaling practices, but I skipped a few days because I was so busy. I noticed that when I skip those practices, my anxiety goes up significantly. I guess I want to focus on how to balance these practices with my academic workload better.
