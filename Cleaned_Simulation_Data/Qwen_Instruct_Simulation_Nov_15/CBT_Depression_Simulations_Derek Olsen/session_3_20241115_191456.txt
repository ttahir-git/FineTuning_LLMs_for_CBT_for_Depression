Patient: Hey, Nova. Thanks for the summary. Let's see...

1. **Breathing Exercises**: I've been trying to do them, but I keep forgetting. I set reminders, but sometimes I just ignore them. It's hard to stay consistent.

2. **Communication with Children**: I tried some of those conversation starters with Emma. It felt awkward at first, but she seemed to appreciate it. We talked about her kids and how they're doing. It was nice, but I still feel like I'm walking on eggshells.

3. **Cleaning the Apartment**: I started with the kitchen. It's not perfect, but it's better than before. I need to keep going, but it's slow.

4. **Feeling Like a Burden**: I still feel like a burden, especially with my kids. They're always worried about me, and I hate that. I want to be strong for them, not the other way around.

5. **Woodworking**: I haven't really touched it yet. I keep thinking about it, but I haven't made the time. It feels like too much right now.

I guess I'm just struggling to keep up with everything. It feels overwhelming. Any suggestions on how to make it easier?

Therapist: : Thank you, Derek, for sharing your thoughts and experiences. It sounds like you're facing some significant challenges, but you're also making progress. Let's break down some strategies to help you stay on track and manage your feelings of overwhelm.

### 1. **Breathing Exercises**
- **Daily Reminders**: Use multiple reminders throughout the day. You can set alarms on your phone, use a smartwatch, or even leave sticky notes in places you frequently visit.
- **Routine Integration**: Try to find a routine that incorporates these exercises. For example, set a specific time each day, like right after you wake up or before bed.
- **Progress Tracking**: Keep a log of when you do your breathing exercises and any positive changes you notice. This can help you stay motivated.

### 2. **Communication with Children**
- **Regular Practice**: Continue to use the conversation starters with your children. The more you practice, the more natural it will feel. Consistency is key.
- **Small Conversations**: Start with small, easy conversations to build your confidence. For example, discuss your day or ask for their opinion on something.
- **Supportive Environment**: Encourage a non-judgmental environment where your children feel safe expressing themselves. Validate their feelings and concerns.

### 3. **Cleaning the Apartment**
- **Baby Steps**: Break down the cleaning task into smaller, manageable steps. Focus on one room or area at a time. For example, clean the kitchen first, then move to the living room.
- **Motivational Boosters**: Reward yourself for completing small tasks. This could be something as simple as watching a short TV show or having a snack.
- **Regular Cleaning**: Set a specific time each week for cleaning, and gradually increase the frequency as you feel more comfortable.

### 4. **Feeling Like a Burden**
- **Recognize Contributions**: Reflect on the positive things you do for your children. Write them down in a gratitude journal or share them with your family. This can help shift your perspective.
- **Open Communication**: Share your feelings with your children. Let them know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that they don’t need to worry about you all the time. Encourage them to express their own feelings and concerns.
- **Professional Support**: Consider speaking with a counselor or therapist who can help you and your family communicate more effectively.

### 5. **Woodworking**
- **Start Small**: Begin with a small woodworking project that doesn’t require too much time or effort. This can build your confidence and make it feel less daunting.
- **Set Specific Goals**: Define what you want to achieve with your woodworking. It could be as simple as making a small item or fixing an existing piece of furniture.
- **Scheduled Time**: Set aside a specific time each week to work on your project. This helps create a routine and makes the activity more manageable.

### Next Steps
- **Consistency.

1. **Breathing Exercises**: I'll try setting more reminders and maybe do them right after I wake up. It's a good time when I'm not too distracted.

2. **Communication with Children**: I'll keep using those conversation starters. Maybe I can start with small talks about our days. It sounds simple, but it's a start.

3. **Cleaning the Apartment**: I'll focus on one room at a time. The kitchen's done, so next might be the living room. Small steps, right?

4. **Feeling Like a Burden**: I'll try to remember the good things I do for my kids and maybe talk to them about how I feel. It's hard, but I know it's important.

5. **Woodworking**: I'll start small. Maybe fix something simple around the house. It's been a while, but I think I can handle that.

I guess what I need is to keep reminding myself that these small steps are progress. It's not about doing everything perfectly, just doing something. Does that make sense?

Therapist: : Absolutely, Derek, your approach is very positive and realistic. It's great to see you focusing on small, manageable steps. This will help you build momentum and maintain a sense of progress. Here are a few additional suggestions to support your efforts:

### 1. **Breathing Exercises**
- **Routine Integration**: Setting your reminders right after you wake up is a great start. You might also consider doing a quick breathing exercise when you're feeling particularly stressed during the day.
- **Breathing Apps**: Using a breathing app can be helpful. These apps often provide guided sessions that can make it easier to remember and perform the exercises.
- **Visualization**: Visualize a calm, peaceful scene during your breathing exercises. This can enhance the relaxation response.

### 2. **Communication with Children**
- **Regular Practice**: Consistency is key. Even if you start with small talks about your day or theirs, try to make it a regular part of your daily routine.
- **Active Listening**: Practice active listening by giving your full attention when they talk. This can show them that you value their words and feelings.
- **Feedback**: Encourage them to give you feedback on the conversation starters. This can help you gauge if they find them helpful or need adjustments.

### 3. **Cleaning the Apartment**
- **Motivation Boosters**: Set small, achievable goals for each cleaning session and give yourself a reward once you complete them. This could be something as simple as a short break or a favorite snack.
- **Break Down the Task**: Create a cleaning checklist and tackle one task at a time. For example, clean the kitchen one day, the living room the next, and so on.
- **Music or Podcasts**: Listening to music or podcasts while you clean can make the process more enjoyable and less daunting.

### 4. **Feeling Like a Burden**
- **Gratitude Journal**: Keep a gratitude journal to write down the positive things you do for your family. This can help you recognize your contributions.
- **Family Meetings**: Have regular family meetings where you can discuss feelings and concerns openly. This can help everyone feel more connected and supported.
- **Professional Support**: Consider speaking with a counselor who can help you and your family work through these feelings together.

### 5. **Woodworking**

- **Woodworking Videos**: Watch some woodworking tutorials online. This can provide you with visual guidance and inspiration.
- **Join Online Communities**: Join woodworking forums or communities where you can ask for advice and share your progress. This can be a great source of support and motivation.
