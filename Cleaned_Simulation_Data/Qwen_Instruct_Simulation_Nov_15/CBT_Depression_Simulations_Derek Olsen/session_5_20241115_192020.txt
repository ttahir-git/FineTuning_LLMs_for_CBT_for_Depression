Therapist: : Hello, Derek. It's great to see you again. I'm glad you're able to summarize our session from last time. It looks like we've made some good progress since our first meeting. Let's start by going over what's been happening since then, and we can also look at how the techniques and exercises we introduced are working for you.

From your summary, it seems like you've been consistent with the breathing exercises and found them helpful. The breaking down of tasks into smaller, more manageable steps for cleaning and woodworking has also been beneficial. How have you been feeling about these activities? Have you noticed any changes in your anxiety levels or your relationships with your family members?

Additionally, your insights about progress not needing to be perfect and the importance of small, consistent steps are really positive. How have you been applying these insights to other areas of your life? And how do you feel about being more open with your children about your feelings? Have you found this to be a helpful approach?

Let's also touch on the communication improvements with Emma. How are you finding it to set specific times for check-ins? Has this been easier or more challenging than you expected? And have you noticed any changes in your relationship with Emma since implementing this?

Lastly, have you encountered any new challenges or successes that you'd like to discuss? I'm here to support you as we continue this journey of improvement.

Patient: Hey, Nova. Yeah, I've been trying to stick with those breathing exercises, but it's still a struggle to remember them consistently. I set some reminders on my phone, but I still forget sometimes.

As for the cleaning and woodworking, I've been taking it slow. I've been focusing on one small area each day for cleaning, and it's been easier to manage. I even put on some music to make it less of a drag. With woodworking, I started with some simpler projects, like fixing a chair. It's been okay, but I still get anxious thinking about bigger projects.

I've been trying to be more open with Emma, but it's not easy. I set specific times to check in with her, and it's been a bit better. We've had some decent conversations, but I still feel like I'm holding back. I guess it's a start, though.

I haven't really noticed much change in my anxiety levels. It's still there, just like always. But I guess the small steps are helping a bit. I just wish it was easier to see the progress.

No new big challenges or successes, really. Just trying to keep moving forward, even if it's slow.

Therapist: : Hi Derek, thank you for sharing your experiences since our last session. It's great to hear that you're continuing to implement the techniques we discussed, even if it's still a bit of a challenge. Let's break down your progress and areas where you're facing some hurdles.

### Breathing Exercises
You mentioned it's still a struggle to remember to do the 4-7-8 breathing exercises consistently. Have you considered different ways to make it a more automatic part of your routine? For example, setting multiple reminders throughout the day or associating the exercises with certain activities, like before you start a task or before bed?

### Cleaning and Woodworking
Focusing on one small area each day for cleaning has been helpful, and it’s good that you’re adding music to make it more enjoyable. With woodworking, starting with simpler projects is a smart approach. It’s important to celebrate small successes, even if it feels like progress is slow. Have you found any specific moments where you felt a sense of achievement with these tasks?

### Communication with Emma
Setting specific times to check in with Emma is a positive step, and it’s good that you’re seeing some improvement in your conversations. It’s normal to feel hesitant to open up fully, but even small steps towards sharing your feelings can make a big difference. How are you handling the moments when you feel like you're holding back? Is there any particular way you can push through those feelings?

### Anxiety Levels
You noted that your anxiety levels haven’t changed significantly, which is understandable given the work we’re doing is gradual and cumulative. It’s important to remember that progress doesn’t always show up in dramatic ways but through a series of small improvements. How are you managing your anxiety in other areas of life? Are there any other strategies you’ve tried that might be helpful?

### Open Communication with Children
You mentioned being more open with your children about your feelings, but it’s not easy. How are your children responding to this? Have you noticed any changes in their behavior or in your relationship with them?

### Next Steps
Let’s focus on a few areas for improvement:

1. **Breathing Exercises**: Let’s explore ways to make these exercises more automatic. Could we try integrating them into specific moments in your day?
2. **Cleaning and Woodworking**: Continue with the small, manageable steps and celebrate each success, no matter how small. Could we set a goal to increase the complexity of your woodworking projects gradually?
3. **Communication with Emma**: Keep setting specific check-in times and gradually increase the openness of your conversations. How about setting a specific goal for what you want to discuss in each check-in?
4. **Anxiety Management**: Discuss any other strategies you might be using to manage anxiety, and explore new ones if needed.
5. **Open Communication with Children**: How are you feeling about sharing your feelings with your children? Can we set a goal for one specific way to share your feelings each.

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for the questions. Let's break it down:

### Breathing Exercises
Yeah, I still forget to do them sometimes. I've tried setting reminders, but they don't always catch me in the right moment. I'll give it another go to make them more automatic.

### Cleaning and Woodworking
Cleaning one small area each day really helps. I've even started listening to music while I do it, which makes it less of a chore. With woodworking, I finished a small birdhouse last week. It's not much, but it felt good to see the finished product.

### Communication with Emma
Setting specific times to talk to Emma has been okay. Sometimes I still hold back, but I remind myself that small steps are better than nothing. It's tough to open up, but I'm trying.

### Anxiety Levels
My anxiety hasn't changed much, but I haven't really tried new strategies. I just stick with what we've talked about so far. Maybe I should explore some new methods?

### Open Communication with Children
My kids are responding okay, but I still feel like I'm not sharing enough. Emma seems a bit more understanding, though. It's a slow process.

### Next Steps
1. **Breathing Exercises**: I'll try to integrate them more into my day. Maybe before meals or

Therapist: Great, Derek. It's good to see you're staying committed to the process and making some adjustments. Let's continue to build on this momentum.

### Breathing Exercises
Integrating the breathing exercises into specific moments throughout your day is a good idea. How about trying them:
- Before breakfast or dinner
- Right after waking up
- Before bed

These moments can help establish the habit. Additionally, you might find it helpful to combine the breathing with another activity, like before you start your morning routine or right before a challenging task.

### Cleaning and Woodworking
You're doing well with the small, manageable steps. Celebrating small successes is crucial. For the birdhouse project, you could consider taking a picture of it and putting it somewhere visible to remind yourself of your progress. This can also help you feel a sense of accomplishment.

### Communication with Emma
Setting specific times for check-ins is a good start. To further encourage openness, you might want to set a goal for what you want to discuss during each check-in. For example:
- Week 1: Share one positive thing that happened that day
- Week 2: Talk about one small concern or challenge
- Week 3: Share one thing you're grateful for

This can help you gradually increase your openness and make the conversations more meaningful.

### Anxiety Levels
Exploring new strategies can be very beneficial. Some techniques you might consider include:
- Progressive muscle relaxation: Tightening and relaxing different muscle groups
- Mindfulness meditation: Focusing on the present moment without judgment
- Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings to process them more deeply

You could start with one new strategy and see how it goes before adding another. It's important to find what works best for you.

### Open Communication with Children
It's important to set a consistent routine for sharing your feelings. Perhaps you could decide to share one specific feeling or concern with them each day. This can help you stay accountable and make the process more manageable.

### Next Steps
Let's focus on the following actions:
1. **Breathing Exercises**: Try to integrate them into specific moments each day, like before breakfast, right after waking up, and before bed.
2. **Cleaning and Woodworking**: Take pictures of your small successes and put them somewhere visible to remind yourself of your progress.
3. **Communication with Emma**: Set a specific goal for what to discuss during each check-in to gradually increase openness.
