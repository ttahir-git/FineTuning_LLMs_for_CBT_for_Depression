Therapist: : Hi Derek, it's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? Have you had a chance to practice any of the breathing exercises or reach out to your children? Also, how have you been feeling about taking those small steps we discussed?

Patient: Hey, Nova. I've been... alright, I guess. The breathing exercises, I've been trying to do them every day. They help a bit, but it's hard to keep at it when everything else feels like it's falling apart. 

As for my kids, I called Emma last week. We talked for a bit, but it was... awkward. She's worried about me, I can tell. I didn't really know what to say, so the conversation didn't last long. I don't know if that counts as reaching out.

Small steps, yeah. I started cleaning up my apartment a little each day. It's not much, but it's something. Feels like I'm moving in the right direction, even if it's slow.

Therapist: : Hi Derek, thank you for sharing your experiences. It's great that you've been consistent with the breathing exercises; they can indeed help manage stress and improve your overall well-being. It's normal to find it challenging to maintain such practices, especially when things feel overwhelming. Let's discuss some strategies to make it easier and more sustainable for you.

Regarding your interaction with your children, it sounds like a difficult conversation, but taking the first step is a significant achievement. Sometimes, starting with shorter, more structured interactions can make the conversations less awkward. Maybe you could start by asking them how their day was or express your feelings about how you're feeling, without expecting a deep, lengthy discussion right away.

On the topic of taking small steps, it's wonderful that you're already noticing progress in cleaning your apartment. This is a great example of making the manageable steps work for you. Perhaps you could continue with the small activities you've started, such as engaging in a 5-minute hobby or activity each day. It might also be helpful to set specific, achievable goals for each day to give you a sense of accomplishment.

Let's also revisit the cognitive distortions you identified. Can you recall any specific thoughts or beliefs that have been particularly challenging or unrealistic? We can work on challenging those thoughts together, which might make it easier for you to see your situation in a more balanced way.

How do you feel about the next steps? Are there any concerns you have about continuing in this direction?

Patient: Yeah, the breathing exercises are helping a bit, but I still feel like I'm barely keeping my head above water. It's hard to stay consistent when everything else feels so heavy.

Talking to my kids, I guess I just need to keep trying. Maybe starting with smaller conversations is a good idea. I can ask them about their day or something simple like that. It's just... I feel like I'm failing them, you know? Like I'm not the father they deserve.

Cleaning up my place, it's small, but it's something. I can see the difference, even if it's just a little bit each day. Maybe I'll try that 5-minute hobby thing. I used to love woodworking, but I haven't touched my tools in ages. Maybe I could start with that.

As for those cognitive distortions, I keep thinking that I'm a burden to everyone. Like, I'm just a drain on my kids, my friends, and even myself. It's hard to shake that feeling, even when I know it's not true. I guess I need to challenge that thought, but I don't know how.

Next steps, I'm worried that I'll just fall back into old habits. I've been trying to do better, but it feels like I'm fighting a losing battle sometimes. I don't

Therapist: : : Hi Derek, thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings. It's understandable to feel like you're not making enough progress and to worry about falling back into old habits. Let's break down your concerns and explore some strategies to address them.

### Breathing Exercises
It's great that you're continuing the breathing exercises, even if it feels challenging. Here are a few tips to help you stay consistent:
1. **Set a Remind**: Use an alarm or reminder app on your phone to remind you to do the breathing exercises at specific times.
2. **Make it Part of Your Routine**: Try to do the breathing exercises at the same time each day, perhaps before bed or in the morning when you wake up.
3. **Find a Support System**: Maybe you can find a friend or family member who can remind you or do the exercises with you.

### Conversations with Your Children
Starting with small, structured conversations is a good approach. Here are some steps to make it easier:
1. **Choose a Specific Time**: Set aside a specific time each day to talk, even if it's just for 5-10 minutes.
2. **Start with a Positive Note**: Begin the conversation with something positive or a simple question, like "How was your day?" or "Did you have a favorite part of your day today?"
3. **Be Honest and Vulnerable**: Share a little bit about how you're feeling. This can help build trust and open the door for them to share their feelings too.

### Challenging Cognitive Distortions
Let's work on challenging those thoughts about being a burden. Here’s how we can approach it:
1. **Identify the Distorted Thought**: You mentioned thinking, "I'm a burden to everyone." Let's write this thought down.
2. **Find Evidence Against the Thought**: Think about situations where you’ve shown your children, friends, and yourself that you are not a burden. For example, how have you supported them in the past?
3. **Rethink the Thought**: Challenge the thought by considering more balanced or realistic alternatives. For example, "I am capable of contributing in many ways, and I have shown that many times."

### Small Steps and Hobbies
Starting a hobby like woodworking can be a great way to focus on something positive and rewarding. Here are some tips:
1. **Start Small**: Don’t feel pressured to do a lot right away. Start with something simple, like organizing your tools or cleaning up your workspace.
2. **Set Achievable Goals**: Break down woodworking into small tasks, like spending 10 minutes a day setting up your tools or working on a small project.
3. **Celebrate Progress**: Each time you complete a small task, acknowledge your progress. This can boost your motivation.

### Addressing Worry About Falling Back
It’s natural to worry about slipping back into old patterns. Here are a few strategies:
1.

Patient: Thanks for the tips, Nova. I'll try setting reminders for the breathing exercises. It might help to have something concrete to follow each day.

Talking to my kids, I guess I can start with those small questions. I'll set aside some time each day to call them, even if it's just for a few minutes. It's hard to be vulnerable, but maybe it'll help in the long run.

As for being a burden, I can think about times when I've supported them. Like when I helped Emma move into her first apartment or when I taught Jake how to fix things around the house. Those are moments when I felt useful, not like a burden.

Starting woodworking again, I'll start small. Maybe I'll clean up my tools today and see how it feels. I used to love working with wood, so it might be a good way to get my mind off things.

I'm still worried about falling back into old habits, though. It's like I'm walking on a tightrope, and I'm afraid I'll slip. But I guess if I keep taking these small steps, it might make it easier to stay on track.

Thanks for the advice, Nova. I'll give it a shot and see how it goes.

Therapist: : You're welcome, Derek. I'm glad you're willing to give these strategies a try. It's important to remember that change takes time and effort, and it's okay to have setbacks along the way. Here are a few additional tips to support you:

### Breathing Exercises
- **Consistency is Key**: Keep the reminders consistent and try to practice at the same time each day. This will help it become a habit.
- **Track Your Progress**: Keep a log of when you practice your breathing exercises. Seeing progress can be motivating.

### Conversations with Your Kids
- **Regular Practice**: Try to make these conversations a regular part of your day. Even short, positive interactions can have a cumulative effect.
- **Use a Script**: If you find it difficult to think of things to say, write down a few simple questions or statements to start the conversation.

### Challenging Cognitive Distortions
- **Maintain a Journal**: Keep a journal to track your thoughts and the evidence you collect against negative beliefs. This can help you identify patterns and make it easier to challenge them.
- **Affirmations**: Write down positive affirmations about yourself and your worth. Reading them regularly can help reinforce more balanced thinking.

### Woodworking and Small Steps
- **Celebrate Small Wins**: Each time you take a step, no matter how small, acknowledge and celebrate it. This can help build your confidence.
- **Seek Support**: If you find woodworking challenging, consider reaching out to a woodworking community or a mentor who can offer guidance and encouragement.

### Staying On Track
- **Set Realistic Goals**: Break larger tasks into smaller, manageable goals. This can make the process less overwhelming and more achievable.
- **Reflect on Your Progress**: Take time to reflect on how far you’ve come. Celebrate each step, no matter how small.

### Additional Resources
- **Support Groups**: Consider joining a support group for individuals dealing with similar challenges. Sharing experiences and learning from others can be incredibly beneficial.
- **Therapeutic Activities**: Engage in activities that promote mindfulness and relaxation, such as yoga or guided imagery, which can complement your breathing exercises.

Remember, it's okay to seek help and lean on others when you need it. You’re doing great work, Derek, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Let's schedule the next session in a week. By then, you'll have more insights and might have some new strategies to share. I look forward to hearing how things are going for you.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'll try to keep a log for the breathing exercises and write down some questions for my kids. It might help to have something to refer to when I'm struggling to find the right words.

I'll also keep a journal for those negative thoughts. It's hard to see the good in myself sometimes, but maybe writing it down will help me remember that I'm not just a burden.

Woodworking, I'll start with cleaning up my tools and see how it goes. I used to love it, so maybe it'll help me feel more like myself again.

I'll think about joining a support group too. It might be good to talk to others who are going through similar stuff.

Thanks for the support, Nova. I'll see you next week and let you know how things are going.
