Therapist: Hello Derek,

Thank you for your detailed summary of our last session. It’s great to see you reflect on the progress we’ve made and the techniques that have been helpful. Let’s build on these insights and continue moving forward.

### Review of Mindfulness and Small Tasks
It sounds like the mindfulness exercises and small tasks have been beneficial for you. Continuing with these, even if just for a few minutes at a time, can help manage stress and maintain a sense of purpose. You might find it helpful to set a specific time each day to practice mindfulness, perhaps right after waking up or before going to bed.

### Analyzing the Daughter’s Call
Breaking down the situation using the thought record was very effective. Acknowledging that your daughter’s concern was genuine can help reduce feelings of being a burden. It’s important to remember that her worry comes from a place of love and concern, not from a lack of appreciation for what you do.

### Coping Strategies and Future Plans
You’ve made significant progress in developing coping strategies. Continuing to set and work on small, achievable goals can help boost your confidence and provide a sense of accomplishment. It’s great that you’re considering helping with tasks or activities around the house or neighborhood. These actions not only help others but also give you a sense of purpose and social connection.

### Pain Management Strategies
Pain can be a significant challenge, but it’s good to know that there are strategies to manage it. Whether it’s through relaxation techniques, physical activity, or other methods, finding what works best for you can make a big difference.

### Insights and Realizations
It’s encouraging to hear about your insights and realizations. Recognizing the positive aspects of social interactions and the sense of purpose from helping others can be powerful. Keep focusing on these positive aspects as they can help counteract negative thoughts.

### Homework/Tasks for Next Session
For next time, let’s continue with the tasks assigned:

1. **Mindfulness Exercises**: Practice for a few minutes each day. You might find it helpful to start with a timer and gradually increase the duration.
2. **Thought Records**: Keep up with them, especially during challenging times. This will help you identify and challenge any negative thoughts more effectively.
3. **Small Tasks**: Set and work on realistic goals. Even small accomplishments can be rewarding.
4. **Positive Interactions**: Keep a record of positive interactions and accomplishments. This can provide a good mood boost.
5. **Pain Management**: Continue to practice the strategies we discussed. If you find something particularly helpful, share it with me.

### Next Steps
In our next session, we can review how these tasks have been working for you and make any necessary adjustments. We can also delve deeper into any new challenges or areas where you feel stuck. Remember, progress takes time, and it’s okay to face setbacks along the way. Your openness to trying these techniques and your willingness to reflect on their impact is a testament.

Patient: Thanks for the recap, Nova. I appreciate you breaking it down like that. 

Mindfulness, yeah, I've been trying to do it more regularly. I set a timer for a few minutes in the morning, just sitting there, trying to clear my head. It's not easy, but I can see how it might help over time.

About my daughter's call, I guess I see now that she's just worried about me. I still feel like a burden sometimes, but I'm trying to remember that she's coming from a good place.

Small tasks, I've been working on those too. Fixed a leaky faucet for a neighbor last week. Felt good to help out, even if it was just a little thing.

Pain management, that's a tough one. I've been trying some relaxation techniques, but it's hard to stick with them when the pain's bad. I'll keep at it though.

For next time, I'll keep up with the mindfulness, thought records, and small tasks. I'll also try to note down any positive interactions. Maybe that'll help me see things a bit more clearly.

Looking forward to our next session. Thanks for the support, Nova.
