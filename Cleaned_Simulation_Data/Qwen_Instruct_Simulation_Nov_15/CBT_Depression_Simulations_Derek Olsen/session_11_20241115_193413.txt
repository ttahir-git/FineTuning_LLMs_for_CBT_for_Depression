Therapist: : Hi Derek, it's great to see you again. I noticed from our last session that we made some good progress, particularly with your willingness to try new techniques and establish consistent routines. How have you been doing with your financial planning and budgeting? Have you found the Mint app useful for tracking your expenses? Also, how has your mindfulness practice been going, especially with the breath-focused technique? And how about your gratitude journaling? Have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling as a result of these practices?

Patient: Yeah, I've been using the Mint app. It's not perfect, but it's helping me keep track of where my money's going. I set a small goal to save a bit each month, and so far, it's working. The breath-focused mindfulness, I've been doing that most days. It helps a little with the stress, but I still find it hard to stick with it. The gratitude journaling, I've been writing in it before bed. It's weird, but sometimes it makes me feel a bit better, like I'm not just focusing on the bad stuff.

Therapist: Hi Derek, thanks for sharing your updates. It's good to hear that the Mint app is helping you track your expenses and that you're making progress toward your financial goals. It's also great to know that you're finding the breath-focused mindfulness helpful, even if it's a bit challenging to stick with. The gratitude journaling seems like it's having a positive impact, even if it's not always easy.

Let's continue to support you in finding ways to make these practices more manageable and enjoyable. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Financial Planning**: Keep using the Mint app, and consider setting specific times to review your finances, such as once a week. This can help keep you on track with your savings goals.

2. **Mindfulness Practice**: Since you found the breath-focused technique helpful, we could try incorporating it into your daily routine in a more structured way. For example, you might set a reminder to take a few deep breaths every hour, or try a guided mindfulness app that might make the practice feel more structured and accessible.

3. **Gratitude Journaling**: Writing in your gratitude journal before bed is a good routine. You might find it helpful to write down three things you're grateful for each day, but you don't have to do it every night if you're finding it too much. Maybe try once a week and gradually increase the frequency as it becomes easier for you.

4. **Supporting Consistency**: Setting specific times for these practices can really help. For mindfulness, you might set a reminder on your phone or calendar. For the gratitude journal, you could use a pen and paper placed in an easy-to-reach spot before bed.

How do you feel about these suggestions? Do you have any concerns or questions about how we can adjust these practices to better suit your needs?

Patient: I appreciate the suggestions. Setting specific times for reviewing finances sounds like a good idea. I'll try to do that once a week. For the mindfulness, I'll set a reminder on my phone to take a few deep breaths every hour. It might help keep me from getting too stressed out. As for the gratitude journal, I'll stick with writing three things down before bed, but I'll try to do it more often if it feels right. I don't want to push myself too hard, though.

Therapist: : That sounds like a balanced and realistic approach, Derek. It's important to find a routine that feels sustainable for you. Here are a few additional tips to support you:

1. **Financial Planning**: Consider setting aside a specific time each week, perhaps right after dinner, to review your finances. This can help you stay on track without feeling overwhelmed. You might also set a reminder to check your progress towards your savings goals.

2. **Mindfulness Practice**: Using your phone as a reminder is a great idea. You could also try incorporating short mindfulness exercises into your daily activities. For example, you might take a mindful walk during your lunch break or focus on your breathing while waiting in line at the grocery store.

3. **Gratitude Journaling**: Writing three things down before bed is a good start. You could also try a gratitude jar or list where you jot down things you're grateful for throughout the day. This can help you maintain the habit without the pressure of a daily ritual.

4. **Supporting Consistency**: Remember, the goal is to make these practices a part of your routine, not to feel stressed about adhering to them perfectly. It's okay to adjust the frequency or the time of day based on what works best for you. If you find you're struggling, we can reassess and make adjustments together.

How do you feel about these additional suggestions? Are there any specific times or activities that you think might work well for these practices? Let's also discuss any challenges you're facing and how we can address them together.

Patient: I like the idea of a gratitude jar. It sounds easier than writing every night, and I can just drop in a note whenever I think of something. For the mindfulness, I'll try to take a walk during lunch. It might help clear my head and get some fresh air. As for the financial review, I'll do it right after dinner on Sundays. That way, it's done for the week. I'm still a bit skeptical about all this, but I'll give it a shot.

Therapist: : That sounds like a thoughtful and practical approach, Derek. It's great that you're finding ways to make these practices fit into your routine more comfortably. Here's a quick summary of your plan to help keep you on track:

1. **Financial Planning**: 
   - Review finances once a week (Sunday right after dinner).
   - Set a reminder to check progress towards your savings goals.

2. **Mindfulness Practice**: 
   - Take a few deep breaths every hour using a phone reminder.
   - Incorporate short mindfulness exercises into daily activities, such as a mindful walk during lunch.

3. **Gratitude Journaling**:
   - Write three things down in a gratitude journal before bed.
   - Alternatively, use a gratitude jar where you can drop in notes whenever you think of something.

4. **Supporting Consistency**:
   - Adjust the frequency or timing based on what works best for you.
   - Use reminders and set specific times to help maintain the routine.
   - If you face challenges, we can reassess and make adjustments together.

Let's check in next week and see how these practices are going. Remember, the key is to be gentle with yourself and find what works best for you. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or need adjustments, we can discuss that together. How does that sound for now?

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further support in the meantime. You've been making great progress, Derek, and I'm here to help you every step of the way.

Patient: That sounds good. I'll try to stick to this plan and see how it goes. If I run into any problems or need to adjust things, I'll let you know. Thanks for the support.
