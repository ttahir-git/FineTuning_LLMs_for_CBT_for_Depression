### Moving Forward
For this session, let's focus on a few key areas:

1. **Enhancing Your Daily Practice:** How have you been incorporating the 4-7-8 technique in your walks? Have you noticed any changes in your mood or anxiety levels? We can explore ways to further integrate this into your daily activities.
2. **Exploring Other Mindfulness Techniques:** While you've found the 4-7-8 technique effective, there might be other mindfulness exercises that could complement your routine. Perhaps we could try a guided meditation or a body scan exercise to see if it offers additional benefits.
3. **Addressing Specific Anxiety Triggers:** Have there been any specific situations or triggers that have caused increased anxiety since our last session? We can work on developing more targeted strategies to manage these situations.

Let's take some time to discuss these points and adjust your routine as needed. What do you think would be helpful to focus on today?

Patient: Thanks for the summary, Nova. I've been trying to stick to the 4-7-8 breathing during my walks, and it's been helping a bit. I still get anxious sometimes, especially when I think about my financial situation or my kids. But the breathing helps me calm down faster.

I'm not sure about guided meditation or body scans. I've never tried those before. What exactly are they, and how do they work? I might be willing to give them a shot if they can help with my anxiety.

As for specific triggers, money problems are a big one. I'm always worried about how I'm going to pay my bills and keep a roof over my head. And then there's the guilt about not being able to support my kids like I used to. Those thoughts really get to me.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your experiences, Derek. It's important to acknowledge that managing anxiety, especially around significant life stressors like financial worries and family concerns, can be challenging. Let's explore the techniques you're interested in, and I’ll also address your specific triggers.

### Guided Meditation
Guided meditation involves following a trained guide (either in person, via an audio recording, or through a video) who leads you through a series of visualizations, relaxation exercises, and calming affirmations. The goal is to help you enter a deep state of relaxation, which can reduce anxiety and promote mental clarity and emotional balance.

**How It Works:**
1. **Finding a Quiet Space:** You’ll need a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down.
2. **Following the Guide:** The guide will lead you through breathing exercises, visualizations, and positive affirmations.
3. **Relaxation Response:** As you follow the guide, you’ll enter a state of deep relaxation, which can help reduce stress hormones like cortisol.

### Body Scan Meditation
A body scan is a mindfulness practice that involves focusing your attention on different parts of your body, starting from your feet and moving up to your head. This practice helps you become more aware of physical sensations, tension, and areas where you might be holding stress.

**How It Works:**
1. **Lie Down Comfortably:** Find a quiet and comfortable place to lie down.
2. **Focus on Your Breath:** Take a few deep, slow breaths to help you relax.
3. **Scan Your Body:** Slowly move your attention from your toes to the top of your head, noticing any sensations, tensions, or discomfort in each part of your body.
4. **Release Tensions:** As you become aware of tension in a part of your body, try to consciously relax that area.

### Applying These Techniques
Let’s start by incorporating a brief guided meditation or body scan into your routine. You can try it once or twice a day, perhaps in the morning or before bed. Here’s a simple example of a body scan:

**Body Scan Example:**
1. **Lie Down Comfortably:** Find a quiet place to lie down.
2. **Focus on Your Breath:** Take a few deep, slow breaths.
3. **Start at Your Feet:** Bring your attention to your feet. Notice any sensations, tension, or relaxation.
4. **Move Upward:** Gradually move your attention up your legs, belly, chest, arms, and head.
5. **Release Tensions:** As you notice any tension, imagine it slowly releasing and leaving your body.
6. **Finish with Deep Breaths:** Finish by taking a few slow, deep breaths and notice how you feel.

### Addressing Specific Triggers
Let’s also focus on managing your anxiety around your financial situation and concerns about your kids. Here are a few strategies:

1. **Coping Mechanisms:**.

Patient: Thanks for explaining those techniques, Nova. I think I can give the body scan a try. It sounds like something I can do without feeling too out of place. I'll find a quiet spot in my apartment and give it a shot.

As for the financial worries and my kids, it's been tough. I've been trying to break down the tasks, like you suggested last time, but it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I keep thinking about how I used to be able to provide for them, and now I can't even pay my bills on time. It's a constant weight on my shoulders.

I've been using the 15-minute rule to tackle some of the smaller tasks, like sorting through mail or making a call to a creditor. It helps a bit, but the bigger picture still feels overwhelming. Any other ideas on how to manage these specific triggers?
