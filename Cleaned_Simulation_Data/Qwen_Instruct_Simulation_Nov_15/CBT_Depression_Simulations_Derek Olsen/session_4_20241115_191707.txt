Therapist: : Hello Derek, it's great to see you again. Thank you for summarizing our session. Let's dive into today's discussion based on your summary.

First, it sounds like you're making good progress with your breathing exercises and finding new ways to stay consistent. Using multiple reminders and apps can be really helpful. How have the breathing exercises been going, and have you noticed any changes in how you manage your anxiety or stress?

Regarding communication with Emma, it's encouraging to hear about the positive interactions. Could you share any specific conversation starters you used that worked well? Also, how do you feel about continuing to apply active listening techniques in your interactions?

With the cleaning, it's great to see you starting with the kitchen and breaking it down into smaller steps. Have you noticed any changes in how you approach tasks since then? How do you feel about maintaining the cleaning checklist and using music/podcasts during cleaning?

Your feelings of being a burden and hesitation to restart woodworking are understandable, but it's important to remember the progress you've made. Could you talk about what's holding you back from woodworking, and how we might address those concerns?

Overall, it's great to see you focusing on progress rather than perfection. Can you share any specific examples of how focusing on progress has positively impacted your daily life? And how do you feel about the insights we've discussed about the importance of regular, consistent effort?

Lastly, how are you finding the homework you were assigned? Have you started the gratitude journal or the small woodworking project? Any feedback on these would be helpful.

Looking forward to hearing from you and continuing our journey towards managing these challenges.

Patient: Hey, Nova. Thanks for the questions.

The breathing exercises have been okay. I've been using the reminders and the apps, but sometimes I forget. I do notice when I do them, I feel a bit calmer, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed.

With Emma, I tried asking about her day and how her job's going. She seemed to open up more when I asked about her life instead of just talking about mine. I think active listening helps, but it's still hard for me to keep up with it all the time.

Cleaning the kitchen was a good start. Breaking it down into smaller tasks made it less daunting. I've been using music while cleaning, which helps pass the time. The checklist is useful, but I sometimes feel like I'm not doing enough.

Woodworking is tough because I feel like I can't do it as well as I used to. My hands shake sometimes, and I worry about making mistakes. I don't know how to get past that feeling.

Focusing on progress has helped me see that small steps are better than nothing. I've been trying to do a bit more each day, even if it's just a little bit of cleaning or a short conversation with Emma.

I haven't started the gratitude journal yet, but I did pick up a small woodworking project. It's just a simple birdhouse, but

Therapist: Hi Derek,

Thank you for sharing your insights and progress. It's good to hear that you're finding the breathing exercises helpful, even if sometimes you forget to use them. Consistency can be challenging, but remember that each time you do them, you're building a habit that will become more natural over time.

Regarding your conversations with Emma, it's great that asking about her day helped open up the conversation. Active listening can indeed be tough, but it's a valuable skill. Maybe you could try setting aside specific times each day for these conversations, even if it's just for a short while. This can help make it a regular habit.

Breaking down the cleaning tasks and using music has made the process more manageable for you, and the checklist is a practical tool. Keep using these strategies, and remember that taking it one step at a time is key. It's okay if the checklist sometimes feels incomplete; the important thing is that you're making progress.

Regarding woodworking, it's understandable to feel anxious about not being able to do things as well as you used to. The key is to focus on the process rather than the outcome. Maybe start by concentrating on the small tasks, like sanding or painting, rather than building the entire birdhouse at once. This can help reduce the pressure and build your confidence piece by piece.

The gratitude journal is a great idea, and starting small can be beneficial. You could try writing down one thing you're grateful for each day or even just a few minutes a week. Reflecting on the positive aspects of your life can help shift your focus and boost your mood.

You mentioned you started a small woodworking project. That's fantastic! It's a great way to engage in a hobby and potentially improve your skills gradually. Remember to celebrate each small success along the way.

How do you feel about the overall progress you've made in these areas? Are there any specific challenges you're currently facing that you'd like to discuss further?

Looking forward to your continued progress and any feedback you might have!

Patient: Thanks for the pep talk, but let's get real here. The breathing exercises, they help sometimes, but I still forget more often than not. I'm trying, but it's not like it's some magic cure.

Talking to Emma, that's been better. Asking about her day works, but she's still got her guards up. I know I'm not the easiest person to deal with. Active listening, that's a tough one. I catch myself zoning out more than I want to admit.

Cleaning, yeah, it's in the checklist, but I don't stick to it every day. Some days I just can't muster the energy. Music helps though, makes it less of a chore.

Woodworking, that's the big one. I started on the birdhouse, but I screwed up the measurements on the first try. Couldn't even get past the base. The tools feel foreign in my hands now. I worry I'll never be able to do it like I used to.

The gratitude journal, I wrote in it a couple of times. Found it kinda cheesy, to be honest. But I get the point, trying to focus on the good stuff.

Overall, progress is slow. I still feel like a burden, like I'm just taking up space. But I'm here, trying, even if it doesn't

Therapist: It's completely understandable to feel frustrated and like progress is slow, especially when you're dealing with multiple challenges at once. It's important to acknowledge these feelings without judging yourself too harshly. Let's break down some of your concerns and discuss strategies to address them:

1. **Breathing Exercises**: Remember, consistency is key. Even if you forget sometimes, the more you practice, the more automatic it becomes. Consider setting reminders for specific times of the day when you know you're likely to feel stressed. You could also try different breathing techniques, like the 4-7-8 method, which might feel more engaging. Additionally, you might find it helpful to use guided breathing exercises through apps or videos to keep you on track.

2. **Communication with Emma**: It's great that you're noticing improvement, but it's natural for progress to be gradual. Keep focusing on active listening and making conversation starters a regular part of your routine. You could also consider setting aside a specific time each day to check in with her. If she's still guarded, try to understand where she's coming from and validate her feelings. Sometimes, acknowledging her perspective can help build trust.

3. **Cleaning**: Setting specific times for tasks and using a checklist is a great approach. To help with sticking to the routine, you might consider setting small, achievable goals for each day. For example, instead of cleaning the whole kitchen, focus on one area each day. Celebrate each small success, and remember that it's okay to take breaks when you need them.

4. **Woodworking**: It's natural to feel anxious about not being able to do things as well as you used to. Focus on the process rather than the outcome. Start with simple tasks like sanding or painting, and gradually build up to more complex parts of the project. Celebrate each small achievement, and don't beat yourself up over mistakes. They are part of the learning process.

5. **Gratitude Journal**: I understand that it might feel a bit cheesy at first, but giving it a try for a bit longer can be beneficial. You could start with just one or two things per day and gradually increase the number. Over time, you might find that it helps shift your focus to the positive aspects of your life. If you find it still challenging, you could try writing down things you appreciate about your living situation, your children, or even small moments of joy.

6. **Feeling Like a Burden**: It's important to acknowledge these feelings but also to recognize the progress you've made. You're here, you're trying, and you're making a positive impact on your life and your children's lives. It's okay to ask for support when you need it. Consider sharing your feelings with your children in a gentle, honest way. Letting them know how you're feeling can sometimes help them understand and support you better.

How do you feel about incorporating these suggestions? Are there any specific.

Patient: Thanks for the suggestions, Nova. I'll try to keep the breathing exercises more consistent, maybe set more reminders. The 4-7-8 method sounds interesting, I'll give that a shot.

With Emma, I'll keep trying to make conversation starters a regular thing. Setting a specific time to check in with her might help. I know she's got her own stuff going on, so I'll try to be patient.

Cleaning, I'll focus on one area each day. It's easier to handle that way. I'll keep using the checklist and music to make it less of a drag.

Woodworking, I'll start with simpler tasks. I know I can't rush it, and I'll try not to get too down on myself for mistakes. It's a learning process, like you said.

The gratitude journal, I'll give it a bit more time. Maybe writing down small things will help. I appreciate the positive aspects of my life, even if it feels a bit forced at first.

Feeling like a burden, that's a tough one. I'll try to be more open with my kids about how I'm feeling. It might help them understand where I'm coming from.

Overall, I'll keep trying to make progress, even if it's slow. Thanks for the support, Nova.
