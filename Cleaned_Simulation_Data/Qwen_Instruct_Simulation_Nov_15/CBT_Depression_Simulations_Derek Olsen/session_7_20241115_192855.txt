Let's also discuss any new challenges you might be facing and how we can address them.

Patient: Hey, Nova. Thanks for asking. Let's see...

1. **Progress with Breaking Down Tasks**: I've been working on the fishing gear and woodworking projects. For the fishing gear, I finally cleaned out the tackle box and organized everything. It wasn't as bad as I thought. For woodworking, I started on a small project—a birdhouse. Breaking it down into steps helped a lot. The challenge is finding the motivation to start, but once I do, it's not so bad.

2. **Communication Improvements**: Emma and I have been using the check-in template, and it's been better. We're talking more, and it feels less like we're just going through the motions. I haven't extended it to Jake yet, but I plan to this week.

3. **Anxiety Management**: Progressive muscle relaxation has been okay. I've noticed a bit of a decrease in my anxiety, especially when I feel the tension in my back and shoulders. It's not a magic fix, but it helps.

4. **Visual Board and Breathing Exercises**: The visual board is helping with tracking projects. I can see what I've done and what's left, which is a good feeling. Breathing exercises are something I do in the morning and before bed. They help me start and end the day on a calmer note.

5. **

Therapist: Celebrating Small Successes**: It feels good to have checked off tasks on my visual board, especially the small project I completed on the birdhouse. It's the little wins that keep me motivated. I also celebrated when I managed to have a more relaxed conversation with Emma last night.

6. **Homework**: I've been using the check-in template with Emma, and it's going well. I haven't started with Jake yet, but I'll definitely make an effort to include him soon. I've also been doing my breathing exercises in the morning and evening. I've started to notice that I'm a bit calmer during the day.

7. **Insights and Realizations**: I've realized that when I start a task, even a small one, it's easier to keep going. It's like building momentum. Also, I think I've been a bit too hard on myself sometimes, and I need to focus more on the progress I'm making, not just what I haven't done yet.

**New Challenges**: I'm still struggling with finding the motivation to start tasks. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed just thinking about the steps, and I end up putting it off. Also, I notice that my anxiety spikes when I have a lot on my plate at work and at home.

What do you think we could do to address these challenges?

Patient: Thanks for the detailed update, Derek. It's great to hear about your progress, especially with the small wins like completing the birdhouse and having better conversations with Emma. Let's tackle those new challenges one by one.

1. **Motivation to Start Tasks**: It sounds like you're building momentum, but the initial push is still tough. How about we break down tasks even further? For example, if you have a big project, maybe we can focus on just the first 15 minutes of work. Once you start, you might find it easier to keep going.

2. **Anxiety Spikes**: When you feel overwhelmed, it might help to use your progressive muscle relaxation technique right away. Also, could you identify any specific triggers that cause these anxiety spikes? Knowing what sets you off can help us find ways to manage it better.

3. **Communication with Jake**: Extending the check-in template to Jake is a good next step. Maybe we can role-play a bit to practice how you'll introduce it to him. This way, you'll feel more confident when you talk to him.

4. **Celebrating Progress**: Keep celebrating those small successes. They really do add up and can make a big difference in your overall mood and motivation.

How does that sound?

Therapist: : That sounds like a great plan, Derek. Let's delve into each of these strategies to help you overcome your challenges.

1. **Motivation to Start Tasks**: Breaking tasks down further into very small steps can indeed help. Let's try the "15-minute rule." Set a timer for 15 minutes and focus on just that first 15 minutes of the task. Once you start, it can be easier to keep going. If you find this helpful, we can gradually increase the time.

2. **Anxiety Spikes**: Identifying triggers is a good first step. Could you keep a journal for a week to track situations that trigger your anxiety? Once we know the triggers, we can develop specific strategies to manage them. For example, if work stress is a major trigger, we might focus on ways to manage work-related stress, such as time management techniques or talking to your supervisor about your workload.

3. **Communication with Jake**: Role-playing can be a powerful tool. Let's set aside some time to practice how you might introduce the check-in template to Jake. This can include discussing the benefits and how it might improve your relationship. It might also help to have a few scenarios ready, such as how to handle initial resistance or how to encourage Jake to participate.

4. **Celebrating Progress**: Absolutely, let's continue to celebrate those small successes. You can set up a rewards system for yourself, like treating yourself to something you enjoy after completing a task or reaching a milestone. This can reinforce positive behaviors and keep you motivated.

Additionally, let's add some new techniques to your toolbox:

- **Mindful Breathing**: You might find it helpful to incorporate short, mindful breathing exercises during moments of anxiety. Focus on deep, slow breaths and try to center yourself.

- **Time Management Techniques**: Learning how to manage your time more effectively can reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. We can explore techniques such as prioritizing tasks, setting realistic goals, and breaking down your schedule.

- **Physical Activity**: Regular exercise can significantly reduce anxiety and boost your mood. We can discuss incorporating physical activities you enjoy into your routine.

How does this sound? Let's start with implementing the 15-minute rule and mindful breathing, and we can build from there.

Patient: Alright, Nova, let's give these strategies a shot.

1. **Motivation to Start Tasks**: The 15-minute rule sounds doable. I'll set a timer and just focus on the first 15 minutes of a task. Hopefully, that'll get me going.

2. **Anxiety Spikes**: I'll keep a journal to track what triggers my anxiety. It'll be good to know what exactly is setting me off.

3. **Communication with Jake**: Role-playing sounds like a good idea. Let's do that. I need to be prepared when I talk to Jake about the check-in template.

4. **Celebrating Progress**: I like the idea of a rewards system. Maybe I'll treat myself to a fishing trip or a new woodworking tool after completing a big task.

**New Techniques**:

- **Mindful Breathing**: I'll try to do some mindful breathing when I feel anxious. It might help calm me down.

- **Time Management Techniques**: I could definitely use some help with time management. Breaking down my schedule and prioritizing tasks might make things less overwhelming.

- **Physical Activity**: I used to enjoy fishing and woodworking, which are physical activities. Maybe I can get back into those more regularly.

Let's start with the 15-minute rule and mindful breathing. I'll

Therapist: : That sounds like a great plan, Derek. Starting with the 15-minute rule and mindful breathing is a solid first step. Let's make sure to set some reminders or notifications to help you remember to use these techniques. Here’s how we can implement them:

1. **Motivation to Start Tasks**:
   - **Set a Timer**: When you're faced with a task, set a timer for 15 minutes. Focus on the first 15 minutes without worrying about the rest. Once you start, it’s often easier to keep going.
   - **Use Reminders**: You might set up a reminder on your phone or computer to help you remember to start your task.

2. **Anxiety Spikes**:
   - **Track Triggers**: Keep a journal to track when and why you feel anxious. This can help you identify patterns and triggers.
   - **Mindful Breathing**: When you notice your anxiety rising, pause and do some mindful breathing. Focus on your breath for a few minutes.

3. **Communication with Jake**:
   - **Role-Playing**: Practice what you want to say to Jake about the check-in template. Think about different scenarios and how you might respond to different reactions. This can help reduce nervousness and increase confidence.
   - **Introduce the Template**: When you talk to Jake, be clear about the benefits. Explain how it can make communication smoother and more meaningful for both of you.

4. **Celebrating Progress**:
   - **Rewards System**: Set up a system to reward yourself for completing tasks. It could be as simple as treating yourself to a short break, a small gift, or an enjoyable activity.

**New Techniques**:
- **Mindful Breathing**: You can use the 4-7-8 technique: inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds. This can be done anywhere and is particularly helpful in moments of anxiety.
- **Time Management**: Break down your day into smaller blocks of time. Prioritize tasks and allocate specific times for each. You might also consider using a planner or scheduling app to keep track of your time.
- **Physical Activity**: Regular physical activity is beneficial. You could schedule a short walk, a fishing trip, or some woodworking projects into your weekly routine. Physical activity can help reduce anxiety and boost your mood.

Let's start by implementing the 15-minute rule and mindful breathing. You might find it helpful to start with a simple task like organizing your desk or starting a small woodworking project. Once you get comfortable with this, we can gradually introduce the other techniques.

How does that sound? Let’s start with the first task using the 15-minute rule. If you have any questions or need further guidance, feel free to reach out.

Patient: Alright, Nova, let's do this.

1. **Motivation to Start Tasks**: I'll set a timer for 15 minutes and start with organizing my desk. It's a small task, but it'll get me going. I'll set a reminder on my phone to help me remember.

2. **Anxiety Spikes**: I'll keep a journal to track when I feel anxious and what's causing it. I'll also try the 4-7-8 breathing technique when I notice my anxiety rising.

3. **Communication with Jake**: I'll practice what I want to say to Jake about the check-in template. I'll think about different scenarios and how I might respond. I'll explain the benefits clearly when I talk to him.

4. **Celebrating Progress**: I'll set up a rewards system. Maybe I'll treat myself to a fishing trip or a new woodworking tool after completing a big task.

**New Techniques**:
- **Mindful Breathing**: I'll use the 4-7-8 technique when I feel anxious. It sounds simple enough to do anywhere.
- **Time Management**: I'll break down my day into smaller blocks of time and prioritize tasks. I might use a planner to keep track of my time.
- **Physical Activity**: I'll schedule a short walk, a fishing

Therapist: : trip, or some woodworking projects into my weekly routine. Starting with a short walk today sounds like a good idea to help boost your mood and reduce anxiety.

Let's get started with organizing your desk using the 15-minute rule. Set your timer, and let’s see how you feel after those first 15 minutes. If you have any challenges or successes, feel free to share.

Also, let's plan the 4-7-8 breathing technique for a time when you feel a bit anxious. Maybe you could use it during your walk or after the desk organizing task. The idea is to practice it when you're in a quiet moment, so you can focus on your breathing without distractions.

Remember, it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Celebrate those small wins, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need any more support or have any questions.

Are you ready to start with the desk organizing task? If you need any help or have any specific questions about the techniques, just let me know.

Patient: Alright, I'm ready to start with the desk organizing task. I've set the timer for 15 minutes. Let's see how it goes.

I'll also plan to use the 4-7-8 breathing technique during my walk later today. It'll be a good time to practice it without distractions.

If I run into any challenges or have any successes, I'll let you know. Thanks for the support, Nova.

Therapist: : You're welcome, Derek. I'm glad to support you through this process. Let's see how the desk organizing task goes. Here are a few tips to help you stay focused:

1. **Stay Focused**: Try to put away items as you go along rather than sorting everything before you start. This can help maintain your momentum.
2. **Keep a Positive Mindset**: Remind yourself that even small steps forward are progress. Celebrate those small victories.
3. **Use the 4-7-8 Technique**: If you start to feel overwhelmed during the task, take a moment to do a quick 4-7-8 breath. It can help you relax and stay centered.

Patient: Alright, Nova, the 15-minute timer just went off. Here's how it went:

1. **Stay Focused**: I managed to put away a lot of clutter on my desk. I sorted through some old papers and found a few things I needed.
2. **Positive Mindset**: I kept reminding myself that even small steps are progress. It helped me stay focused.
3. **4-7-8 Technique**: I didn't feel overwhelmed, so I didn't need to use the 4-7-8 technique during the task.

Overall, it felt good to get some of the clutter off my desk. It's a small win, but it's progress.

For my walk later today, I'll definitely use the 4-7-8 technique if I start to feel anxious. I'll let you know how it goes.

Thanks for the tips, Nova.

Therapist: : You did an excellent job, Derek. It’s wonderful to hear that you made good use of the 15-minute rule and maintained a positive mindset. Congratulations on the progress you made with organizing your desk!

Now, let's focus on the 4-7-8 technique for your walk. Here’s a quick reminder of how to do it:

1. **Inhale for 4 seconds** through your nose.
2. **Hold your breath for 7 seconds**.
3. **Exhale for 8 seconds** through your mouth.

You might find it helpful to count slowly as you do this. This technique can be a great way to center yourself and reduce anxiety during physical activity or any other moments when you need a quick calm-down.
