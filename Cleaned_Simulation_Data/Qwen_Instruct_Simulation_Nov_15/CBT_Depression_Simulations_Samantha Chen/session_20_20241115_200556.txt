Session 19 covered various therapeutic topics and exchanges between the therapist and Samantha Chen. The discussion included exploration of the patient's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Several therapeutic techniques were discussed and practiced during the session. The patient showed engagement with the therapeutic process and the therapist provided appropriate guidance and support throughout the session. Key themes included mental health management and coping strategies.

Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again. I remember our last session and it sounds like we made good progress. To start today, can you quickly recap what themes or issues you are focusing on currently? This will help us to dive right into what's been on your mind since our last meeting.

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to see you too. Lately, I've been struggling a lot with anxiety about my business, GreenThread. I'm constantly worried about whether it will succeed or fail, and that's been keeping me up at night. I've also been feeling really guilty about disappointing my parents with my career change, which has made our relationship even more strained. On top of that, I've noticed that my perfectionism is getting in the way of making decisions, and I end up redoing things over and over again. It's exhausting.

Therapist: Hello Samantha, thank you for sharing those details. It sounds like you're facing a complex set of challenges, which is not uncommon when dealing with both business and personal life stresses. Let's break down the areas you're focusing on:

1. **Anxiety About Your Business**: You mentioned feeling constantly worried about the success or failure of GreenThread.
2. **Guilt Over Career Change**: There's also a sense of guilt regarding the change in your career path and how it affects your relationship with your parents.
3. **Perfectionism**: This trait seems to be hindering your decision-making process and causing you to redo tasks repeatedly, which can be very draining.

Given these themes, we can work on developing some specific coping strategies and tools to help manage your anxiety, address the feelings of guilt, and navigate your perfectionism. Let's start by focusing on the anxiety first. Could you describe a specific situation or thought that triggers your anxiety about your business? This will help us tailor our strategies more effectively.

Patient: Sure, one specific situation that triggers my anxiety is when I have to pitch my designs to potential investors or buyers. I spend hours perfecting every detail, but when I finally present, I get so nervous that I stumble over my words and worry that they won't see the value in what I'm offering. It's like all my hard work feels like it's falling apart in those moments.

Therapist: Hello Samantha, thank you for that detailed description. It's understandable to feel that way, especially when the stakes are high and your efforts feel like they could be easily undone. Let's focus on developing some strategies to help manage your anxiety in those specific situations.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Preparation**: Before presenting, make a list of key points and practice your pitch multiple times. This can help you feel more prepared and confident.
2. **Mindfulness Techniques**: Before and during the presentation, practice deep breathing or mindfulness exercises to help calm your nervous system. You can try the 4-7-8 breathing technique: inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and exhale slowly for 8 seconds.
3. **Reframe Thoughts**: Challenge the negative thoughts that come up during the presentation. Ask yourself if they are realistic or if there are more balanced perspectives. For example, if you think, "They won't understand my design," you could reframe it to, "I have put in a lot of work, and I am confident in my abilities, even if they don't immediately see the value."
4. **Visualization**: Imagine the successful outcome of the pitch. Visualize yourself presenting confidently and successfully. This can boost your confidence and help you stay focused.

### Let's Practice

Let's try a brief mindfulness exercise to help calm your mind. I’ll guide you through a 4-7-8 breathing session.

1. **Find a comfortable seated position** and close your eyes.
2. **Inhale deeply through your nose** for a count of 4.
3. **Hold your breath** for a count of 7.
4. **Exhale slowly through your mouth** for a count of 8.
5. Repeat this cycle 4 times.

After we do this, we can discuss any thoughts or feelings that come up for you. Let's start with the exercise.

Patient: Okay, I'll try the 4-7-8 breathing exercise.

1. I'm sitting comfortably and closing my eyes.
2. Inhaling deeply through my nose for a count of 4.
3. Holding my breath for a count of 7.
4. Exhaling slowly through my mouth for a count of 8.

I'll repeat this cycle 4 times.

(After completing the exercise)

That actually helped a bit. I feel a little calmer now. It's interesting how something so simple can make a difference.

Therapist: : That's wonderful to hear, Samantha! The 4-7-8 breathing exercise is a great tool to help you manage anxiety in the moment. It's a simple yet powerful technique that can be used in various situations.

### Reflecting on the Exercise

Great job on completing the exercise. Did you notice any specific thoughts or feelings as you went through the process? How did you feel before and after the exercise?

### Next Steps

Let's discuss how you can incorporate these strategies into your daily routine. For the presentation anxiety, we can also consider additional techniques such as:

1. **Visualization**: Visualize a successful outcome of your pitch. Imagine the positive feedback, the confidence you feel, and the success of your presentation.
2. **Positive Affirmations**: Use positive affirmations like "I am prepared and capable" or "My ideas are valuable and will be well-received" to reinforce your confidence.
3. **Structured Practice**: Practice your pitch in front of a mirror, record yourself, or practice in front of trusted friends or colleagues. This can help you become more comfortable with your material and reduce nervousness.

### Incorporating Strategies

Let's brainstorm a step-by-step plan to help you manage your anxiety and perfectionism over the next few weeks:

1. **Daily Practice**: Dedicate a few minutes each day to practice deep breathing exercises and positive affirmations.
2. **Structured Pitch**: Create a structured outline for your pitch and practice it daily.
3. **Mindful Presentations**: Use the 4-7-8 breathing technique and positive affirmations before each presentation.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Record your pitches and watch the videos to identify areas for improvement. Use constructive feedback to refine your approach.

### Action Plan

- **Day 1-3**: Practice the 4-7-8 breathing technique and positive affirmations daily.
- **Day 4-7**: Practice your pitch in front of a mirror and record it.
- **Day 8-10**: Use the 4-7-8 breathing technique and positive affirmations before each practice session.
- **Day 11-14**: Start incorporating these techniques into your actual presentations and seek feedback.

Would you like to set some specific goals for this upcoming week, or do you have any questions about the strategies we discussed?

Patient: I think setting specific goals for this upcoming week would be helpful. I'll start with practicing the 4-7-8 breathing technique and positive affirmations daily. I'll also try to practice my pitch in front of a mirror and record it. I'm a bit nervous about recording myself, but I know it's important for improvement.

One question I have is about the positive affirmations. Can you give me some examples of affirmations that might be helpful for my situation? I'm not sure where to start with those.

Therapist: : Absolutely, Samantha, setting specific goals is a great way to move forward. Starting with the 4-7-8 breathing technique and positive affirmations daily is a solid plan. Recording yourself will also provide valuable feedback.

### Positive Affirmations

Positive affirmations can be tailored to address your specific concerns and boost your confidence. Here are some examples that might be helpful for you:

1. **For Anxiety During Presentations:**
   - "I am calm and composed, and my confidence will carry me through."

   - "I am knowledgeable and articulate, and my ideas are valuable."

2. **For Coping with Perfectionism:**
   - "I am making the best decision possible with the information I have."

3. **For Resolving Feelings of Guilt:**
   - "I have made a choice that is right for me, and I am worthy of support."
   - "My parents support and understand my journey, and we will find a way to communicate better."

Patient: Thank you for the affirmations, they're really helpful. I think I'll start with "I am calm and composed, and my confidence will carry me through" and "I am knowledgeable and articulate, and my ideas are valuable." Those resonate with me the most right now.

I'll also make sure to practice the 4-7-8 breathing technique daily and record my pitches. I'm a bit nervous about the recording part, but I know it's important for improvement.

One more thing, I've been thinking about how to approach my parents about my career change. I want to explain my reasons better, but I'm not sure how to start the conversation without it turning into an argument. Do you have any suggestions on how to approach that?

Therapist: : I'm glad you found the affirmations helpful, Samantha. Starting the conversation with your parents about your career change is definitely a sensitive topic, but it can be approached with care and empathy. Here are some steps you can take to help ensure the conversation goes smoothly:

### 1. Choose a Good Time and Place
- **Timing:** Find a time when both you and your parents are relaxed and not distracted. Avoid discussing it during stressful times or when there are other significant issues to address.
- **Privacy:** Choose a private setting where you won’t be interrupted, ensuring you have enough time to discuss the topic thoroughly.

### 2. Prepare for the Conversation
- **Reflect on Your Reasons:** Have a clear understanding of why you made the career change. Consider writing down your thoughts to organize your ideas and stay on track during the conversation.
- **Anticipate Concerns:** Think about what your parents might be worried about and prepare thoughtful responses to address their concerns. For example, if they are worried about your financial stability, you can share your plans for managing that aspect.

### 3. Open the Conversation Positively
- **Start with Positivity:** Begin the conversation by expressing your love and respect for them. For example, you might say, "I value your opinion and want to discuss something important with you."
- **Express Appreciation:** Acknowledge the support they have given you in the past and how much you appreciate their guidance. This can help set a positive tone.

### 4. Communicate Clearly
- **Be Honest and Direct:** Clearly explain why you made the career change. Share your reasons and how you believe this decision will benefit you and your future.
- **Use “I” Statements:** Focus on how this change affects you, rather than blaming or criticizing them. For example, say "I feel more aligned with my passions in this career path," instead of "You should have encouraged me to follow my dreams."

### 5. Listen Actively
- **Show Empathy:** Listen to their concerns and validate their feelings. This shows that you value their opinions and are willing to consider their perspectives.
- **Ask Questions:** Ask them about their worries and concerns to understand their viewpoints better. This can also help you address any misunderstandings or fears they might have.

### 6. Provide Assurances
- **Offer Reassurance:** Assure them that you are committed to your new path and that you will continue to seek their guidance and support. You might say, "I will keep you updated on my progress and will seek your advice as I go."

### 7. Plan for Follow-Up
- **Discuss Ongoing Communication:** Suggest a plan for regular updates and check-ins. This can help maintain open lines of communication and build trust over time.
- **Offer Support:** Let them know how you will support them and any ways they can support you in return.

### Example Conversation
Here’s a brief example.

Patient: Thank you for the detailed suggestions, Nova. I think choosing a good time and place is really important. I'll try to find a quiet evening when we're all relaxed and not rushed.

Preparing for the conversation by reflecting on my reasons and anticipating their concerns is also a good idea. I'll write down my thoughts and think about how to address their worries about my financial stability and future success.

Starting the conversation positively by expressing my love and respect for them is something I hadn't thought of, but it makes a lot of sense. I'll make sure to acknowledge their past support and express my appreciation.

Using "I" statements and being honest about my feelings will help keep the conversation from turning into an argument. I'll focus on how this change aligns with my passions and values.

Listening actively and asking questions to understand their perspective is crucial. I want to show them that I value their opinions and am willing to consider their concerns.

Providing reassurance and planning for follow-up communication will help maintain trust. I'll let them know that I'll keep them updated on my progress and seek their advice as I go.

I think I'm ready to have this conversation with them. Thank you for helping me prepare, Nova.

Therapist: : You're very welcome, Samantha. I'm glad to hear that you feel prepared and confident about approaching this conversation with your parents. Remember, it's a step-by-step process, and each conversation can lead to a deeper understanding and better communication between you and your parents.

### Additional Tips

1. **Be Patient**: It's natural for there to be a learning curve as you both adjust to the changes. Be patient with each other and give it time.
2. **Stay Flexible**: Be open to their feedback and willing to make adjustments if needed. Sometimes, finding a middle ground can be beneficial for everyone.
3. **Seek Support**: If the conversation is particularly challenging or if you feel overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist for additional support.

### Follow-Up Plan

Let's set a follow-up plan to check in on your progress:

1. **1 Week Later**: We'll have a session to discuss how the initial conversation went. You can share any challenges you faced and how you navigated them.
2. **2 Weeks Later**: We'll continue to discuss your ongoing experiences and any new strategies you might need to implement.
3. **Monthly Reviews**: We can schedule monthly check-ins to monitor your progress and address any new concerns or challenges that arise.

Would you like to set a specific date for the first follow-up session in a week? Or do you have any other questions or concerns that I can help with before then?

Patient: I think setting a specific date for the first follow-up session in a week would be helpful. How about next Tuesday at the same time?

I do have one more question, though. I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the tasks I need to do for my business, especially with the upcoming pitch. Do you have any tips on how to manage my time better and stay organized?

Therapist: : That sounds like a great plan, Samantha. Next Tuesday at the same time works perfectly. I'm glad you feel more organized and prepared to start this process.

### Tips for Managing Your Time and Staying Organized

   - **Weekly Check-Ins:** Every week, take some time to review your progress and adjust your plan as needed.

7. **Take Breaks:**
   - **Short Breaks:** Take short breaks (5-10 minutes) every hour to rest your mind and refocus.
