Therapist: : Hi Samantha, it's great to see you again. Thank you for summarizing our last session. Let's pick up where we left off. How have things been going since our last meeting? Have you had any opportunities to practice the communication techniques we discussed? Also, how are you feeling about your transition into the eco-friendly clothing business and your relationship with your parents?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for asking. Since our last session, I did try practicing the communication techniques with my parents. I used the "I" statements and broke down the conversation into steps, which actually helped a bit. We had a less heated discussion about the business, and they seemed more open to hearing my perspective. But, I still feel a lot of pressure and anxiety about the business. I'm constantly worrying if I'm making the right decisions, especially with the financial aspect. My relationship with my parents is improving, but it's still strained. They want to help, but I can tell they're skeptical about the whole venture.

Therapist: : Hi Samantha, it's good to hear that you've been practicing the techniques and seeing some positive changes in your discussions with your parents. That's a step in the right direction, and it's encouraging to see that you're able to communicate more effectively now.

Let's focus on managing your anxiety and the financial pressures you're experiencing. One effective way to handle financial stress is to create a detailed business plan. This can help you make more informed decisions and feel more secure about your future. Additionally, let's explore ways to involve your parents more constructively in your business, perhaps in areas where their expertise can be useful, such as accounting or market analysis.

Regarding your feelings of pressure and anxiety, it might be helpful to break down the decision-making process into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, focus on one aspect of the business at a timeâ€”such as product development, marketing, or financial planning. This can make the process feel less overwhelming.

Let's also continue to work on structured communication. You might find it useful to prepare for these conversations by writing down your thoughts and concerns beforehand. This can help you stay on track during the discussion and ensure that all your points are covered.

How do you feel about setting up another meeting to review your progress and address any new challenges that arise?

Patient: I appreciate the suggestions, Nova. Creating a detailed business plan does sound like a good idea. I've been procrastinating on that because I keep second-guessing myself, but breaking it down into smaller steps might make it more manageable. I could start with the financial planning part, which is where I feel the most anxious.

Involving my parents more constructively is something I've been thinking about too. They do have a lot of experience in business, especially with accounting and market analysis, so maybe I could ask them for help in those areas. It might make them feel more involved and less skeptical.

Preparing for conversations by writing down my thoughts beforehand is a good tip. I tend to get flustered during discussions, so having a clear plan could really help.

Setting up another meeting to review progress sounds like a good idea. I'll try to implement these strategies and see how it goes. I'll also keep practicing the communication techniques with my parents.

Therapist: : : That's great to hear, Samantha. Setting up smaller, actionable steps for your business plan is a solid approach. Let's start with financial planning, as you mentioned, and see how that goes. It's important to take it one step at a time.

Involving your parents in areas where they have expertise is a positive step towards building their support. This not only utilizes their knowledge but also shows them that you value their input. You might consider setting up a meeting with them specifically to discuss these areas and how they can contribute. It could be helpful to have a clear agenda for these meetings, outlining what you hope to achieve and how their involvement can benefit the business.

Preparing for conversations by writing down your thoughts is a fantastic strategy. This can help you stay focused and ensure that all your points are covered. You might also find it useful to practice these conversations in a mirror or with a friend to build your confidence.

Let's plan your next session in two weeks. This will give you time to implement these strategies and see how they impact your feelings and interactions with your parents and your business. In the meantime, keep track of any challenges or successes you encounter, and feel free to reach out if you need any support or have any questions.

Remember, making progress in these areas is a process, and it's okay to face challenges along the way. We'll work through them together. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I'll start working on the financial planning part of the business and set up a meeting with my parents to discuss how they can help with accounting and market analysis. I'll also prepare for our next session by keeping track of any challenges or successes I encounter.

Practicing conversations in a mirror or with a friend is a good idea too. I think that could really help me feel more confident during discussions with my parents.

I'm looking forward to our next session in two weeks. I'll make sure to reach out if I need any support or have any questions before then. Thanks for your help, Nova.
