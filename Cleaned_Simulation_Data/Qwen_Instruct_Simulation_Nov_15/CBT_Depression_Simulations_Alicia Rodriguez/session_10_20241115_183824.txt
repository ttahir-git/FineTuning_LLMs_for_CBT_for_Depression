: I'm glad you're feeling confident about implementing these strategies. Remember, it's okay to start small and gradually build up these practices. Every step forward counts, no matter how small it might seem.

Before we wrap up, I want to check in:
1. Do you feel clear about all the strategies we discussed today?
2. Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on in our next session?
3. Would you like to schedule our next session for two weeks from now?

Also, remember that it's normal if some strategies work better than others - we can always adjust and refine our approach based on what works best for you.
Me: Yes, I feel clear about the strategies. The mindfulness exercise seems straightforward, and I appreciate having concrete steps for everything else.

For our next session, I'd like to focus on managing work-related anxiety, especially since I'm still adjusting to the new responsibilities from the promotion.

And yes, two weeks from now would work well. That'll give me time to try out these strategies and see what works best.

Thanks for checking in, Nova. I'm feeling more optimistic about managing everything.
Therapist: : That's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more optimistic, Alicia. Your commitment to making positive changes is evident, and it's great that you're approaching this with such a practical mindset.

For our next session, we'll definitely focus on work-related anxiety and your adjustment to new responsibilities. Perhaps you could keep a brief log of specific situations at work that trigger anxiety - this would help us develop more targeted strategies.

I'll schedule our next session for two weeks from now. In the meantime, remember to:
1. Try the mindfulness exercise
2. Implement the refined communication script with your parents
3. Work on your sleep hygiene
4. Start breaking down your work tasks
5. Keep track of anxiety triggers at work

Remember, you don't have to implement everything perfectly right away. Start with what feels most manageable and build from there. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.

Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up today?

Therapist: Hello Alicia,

It’s great to hear that you feel more optimistic. Your progress is very encouraging, and I’m glad you’re feeling confident about applying these strategies. Let’s dive into your next steps and ensure you have a solid plan to manage work-related anxiety.

For our next session, we’ll focus on:
1. Identifying specific situations at work that trigger anxiety.
2. Developing targeted mindfulness techniques for those situations.
3. Creating a plan to break down your work tasks into manageable steps.
4. Refining your communication script to handle new responsibilities effectively.
5. Monitoring and tracking your sleep and overall well-being.

In the meantime, here are a few actionable tips to keep you on track:

1. **Mindfulness Exercise**: Try to practice your mindfulness exercise a few times each day. Focus on staying present and grounding yourself in the moment.
2. **Communication Script**: Use your refined script when interacting with your colleagues or superiors. This can help you navigate new responsibilities more confidently.
3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Aim to establish a consistent sleep routine. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, and create a relaxing bedtime routine.
4. **Task Management**: Start breaking down your work tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.
5. **Anxiety Triggers**: Keep a log of specific work-related situations that trigger anxiety. This will help us identify patterns and develop effective coping strategies.

Remember, it’s normal to feel some level of anxiety as you adjust to new responsibilities. However, by implementing these strategies, you can gradually build your resilience and manage your anxiety more effectively.

Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before we wrap up today? You can share any concerns or questions you might have.

Best regards,
Nova.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's helpful to have these actionable tips laid out. I'll definitely try to practice mindfulness more consistently and keep track of those anxiety triggers at work.

One thing I'm still struggling with is the communication script. I'm not sure if I'm using it correctly or if it's making a difference. Could you give me an example of how to use it in a real situation? That might help me understand better.

Other than that, I think I'm good for now. I'll focus on these strategies and see how it goes. Looking forward to our next session.
