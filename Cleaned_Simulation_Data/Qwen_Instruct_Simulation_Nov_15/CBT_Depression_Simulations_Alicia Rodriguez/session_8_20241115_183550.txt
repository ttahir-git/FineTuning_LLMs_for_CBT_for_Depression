Your response shows good use of both "I" statements and validation statements. You've managed to express your needs clearly while acknowledging your parents' perspective. Let me play the role of a parent to help you practice handling different responses:

"Honey, we're just worried about you. Why haven't you talked to us about this before? We're your parents - we should be able to help you with everything. Maybe if you spent more time with family instead of needing 'space,' you wouldn't feel so overwhelmed."

This is a common type of response that can feel invalidating. How would you respond while maintaining your boundaries and staying calm? Remember to use your breathing techniques if you feel anxious, and try to keep using "I" statements even if the conversation becomes challenging.

What would you say next?

Therapist: Hello, Ms. Rodriguez. It's great to see you again. Let's continue where we left off. When discussing your feelings with your parents, it's important to stay focused on your needs and boundaries. Hereâ€™s how you might respond:

"I understand that you and my parents are worried about me and want to help. However, what I need is some space to navigate my challenges independently. I feel overwhelmed when I don't communicate my boundaries clearly. Maybe we could set up regular check-ins where I can share updates, but also discuss how they can support me without taking away my autonomy. I appreciate their concern, but I believe it's important for me to find my own solutions."

This response maintains your boundaries while showing appreciation for your parents' concern. It also suggests a way forward that respects both your needs and theirs. If you feel anxious, take a few deep breaths before responding to help stay calm and composed.

Patient: Hi, Nova. Thanks for the example. It helps to see how I can respond without feeling like I'm shutting them out completely. I've been trying to practice that kind of response, but it's still tough. 

I've noticed that since our last session, I've been feeling a bit more anxious at work. The promotion has been a lot more demanding than I expected, and I'm finding it hard to balance everything. I've been staying late to review code and take on extra projects, but it's not really helping. I end up feeling more drained and less productive. 

I've also been having trouble sleeping again. I keep waking up in the middle of the night, and when I finally do fall back asleep, I feel groggy and unfocused the next day. It's making it hard to concentrate during meetings, and I've made a few mistakes that I never would have made before.
