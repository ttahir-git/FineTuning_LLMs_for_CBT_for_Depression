   - Document any special memories or feelings that come up during these activities

3. **Building Confidence**:
   - Start with what feels most comfortable

Would you like to schedule our next session to coincide with your first tamales-making experience? We can use that time to process both the practical and emotional aspects of the activity.

Therapist: Hello Alicia,

It's great to hear from you again. Thank you for summarizing our previous session. It sounds like you've been preparing well and are eager to move forward. I'm really excited to support you as you take this next step.

### Next Steps

Given your enthusiasm, it might be beneficial to schedule our next session just after your first tamales-making experience. This way, we can reflect on the process and any emotions or insights that arise. Would you prefer to set that up for a specific date or would you like to wait until you have a clearer idea of when that activity will take place?

### Additional Support

In the meantime, here are a few more tips to help you prepare:

1. **Preparation and Planning**:
   - Take some time to gather all the necessary ingredients and tools for your tamales-making activity. This can reduce stress and make the process smoother.
   - Consider making a checklist of tasks and steps involved in the tamales-making process. This can help you feel more organized and in control.

2. **Emotional Support**:
   - Reach out to your support system if you start feeling overwhelmed. This could be your coworker, friends, or family members who have shown support in the past.
   - If you find yourself feeling anxious, take a moment to practice some deep breathing exercises or other relaxation techniques that work for you.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Keep a notebook or use your phone to document your feelings and thoughts during the activity. This can help you process what you've learned and experienced.

4. **Building Confidence**:
   - If you feel more comfortable starting with the preparation phase, that's perfectly fine. You can always observe and help as you become more confident.
   - Remember, it's completely okay to take breaks and go at your own pace. Trust that each step you take is a step forward.

Looking forward to your progress and hearing about your experience. Let's plan that next session soon!

Best regards,

Patient: Hi, thanks for the tips. I think scheduling the next session right after the tamales-making experience sounds like a good idea. I'm not exactly sure when I'll be doing it, but I'll let you know as soon as I have a date.

I've been gathering the ingredients and tools, and making a checklist definitely helps. It feels more manageable when I break it down into smaller steps.

I'll also reach out to my coworker for support if I start feeling overwhelmed. It's good to have someone to talk to about it.

Looking forward to our next session and sharing how it goes.
