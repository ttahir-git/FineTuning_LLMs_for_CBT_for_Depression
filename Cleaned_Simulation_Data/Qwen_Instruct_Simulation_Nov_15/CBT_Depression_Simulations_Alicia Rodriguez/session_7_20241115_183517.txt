Therapist: : Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again. Thank you for providing that summary. Let's dive right in and pick up where we left off. You mentioned that you have an upcoming conversation with your parents, and you're feeling a mix of anxiety and anticipation. How are you feeling right now as we start this session?

From our last session, you've been doing well with using "I" statements, taking breaks, and practicing breathing exercises. Today, we can focus on refining these techniques and possibly exploring some new strategies to help you manage your emotions during this conversation. 

Would you like to start by sharing any specific concerns or anxieties you have about the upcoming conversation? Or perhaps you'd prefer to practice some of the techniques we discussed last time?

Patient: I'm feeling a bit nervous about the conversation with my parents, to be honest. I know it's important, but the thought of discussing my emotional struggles and setting boundaries is overwhelming. I'm worried they might not understand or might react negatively.

I've been practicing the breathing exercises, and they help a little, but I still feel a lot of anxiety building up as the conversation gets closer. I think practicing some of the techniques we discussed last time would be helpful, especially the "I" statements and validation statements. Maybe we could go over some examples or role-play a bit?

Therapist: : Hi Alicia, thank you for sharing those feelings. It's completely normal to feel nervous about such a significant conversation, especially when it involves discussing your emotional well-being and setting boundaries. Let's start by refining the techniques we discussed last time and see how we can apply them in a role-play scenario.

First, let's go over the "I" statements and validation statements. "I" statements help you express your feelings and needs without blaming or accusing, while validation statements acknowledge your parents' feelings and concerns. Here are a few examples:

1. **"I" Statements:**
   - "I feel really overwhelmed when we talk about my emotions because I worry that I'm not being understood."
   - "I need some space to process my feelings, and I hope we can find a way to make that work for us."

2. **Validation Statements:**
   - "I understand that you're concerned about me, and I appreciate your worry."
   - "I can see that this is a sensitive topic, and I want to make sure we handle it with care and respect."

Now, let's practice a bit. Imagine a scenario where you're starting the conversation with your parents. How would you begin using these statements? Maybe we can start with a brief introduction and then move into discussing your feelings and needs.

Would you like to give it a try? We can role-play the conversation, and I can play the part of your parent, and you can practice speaking. This will help you feel more prepared and confident.

Patient: Sure, I can give it a try. Let's start with the introduction.

"Mom, Dad, I wanted to talk to you about something important. I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately, and I think it's affecting my well-being. I understand that you're concerned about me, and I appreciate your worry. I need some space to process my feelings, and I hope we can find a way to make that work for us."

Now, let's move into discussing my feelings and needs.

"I feel really overwhelmed when we talk about my emotions because I worry that I'm not being understood. I need to set some boundaries to ensure that I can take care of myself while still maintaining our relationship. I hope you can understand and support me in this."

How does that sound?
