Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again. Thank you for sharing that summary. It seems like we made significant progress in our last session. Let's start by reviewing some of the insights and realizations you had. Can you recall any specific moments that stood out to you from our last session? For example, were there any realizations about how seeking support is a sign of strength, or moments when you felt more prepared to take active steps toward healing?

Additionally, how have you been doing since our last meeting? Have you had any opportunities to engage with any of the homework tasks we assigned? Perhaps you could share a bit about your progress or any challenges you've faced.

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to see you too. One moment that really stood out to me last time was when we talked about how seeking support isn't a sign of weakness, but actually a sign of strength. That idea really resonated with me, especially since I've always been so hard on myself.

Since our last meeting, I've been trying to follow through with the homework. I did some research and found a couple of local grief support groups, which was a big step for me. I even attended one of the meetings last week. It was... overwhelming, to be honest. Hearing other people's stories made me realize how much I've been bottling up. But it also felt good to know I'm not alone in this.

I also started drafting a conversation with my parents, but I haven't had the courage to actually call them yet. I keep overthinking it and worrying about how they'll react. I know they mean well, but I'm scared they might not understand or might worry too much.

Overall, I've been feeling a bit more hopeful, but there are still days when I feel really down and just want to bury myself in work. I guess I'm still struggling with finding the right balance.

Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's good to hear that you've been taking the steps we discussed and attending the support group meetings. Your courage to attend that first meeting, despite feeling overwhelmed, is a significant achievement. It's normal to feel a mix of emotions in such settings, and it's important to recognize that this is a healthy part of the process.

Let's break down some of the areas you mentioned:

1. **Seeking Support as a Sign of Strength**: I'm glad that realization has stayed with you. It's crucial to remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Everyone needs support at different times, and it's healthy to lean on others.

2. **Attending the Support Group**: You did incredibly well by attending the meeting. It can be tough to open up to strangers, but sharing your experiences with others who understand can provide relief and validation. Did there be any specific stories or interactions that stood out to you? It's also okay to take breaks between meetings if you need to.

3. **Planning to Talk with Your Parents**: It sounds like you've made good progress with drafting the conversation. Taking the time to prepare is a positive step. Sometimes, it helps to start the conversation with a small, non-threatening topic before diving into more sensitive issues. You might want to say something like, "I've been feeling really down lately, and I wanted to talk to you about what you might suggest or what you went through when you lost a loved one."

4. **Balancing Coping Mechanisms**: It's great that you're aware of the need to find a balance. Overworking can be a way to avoid dealing with feelings, but it's not sustainable. Consider integrating more self-care activities into your routine. Maybe you could try mindfulness exercises, physical activity, or engaging in hobbies that you've missed, like salsa dancing.

5. **Handling Emotions**: On days when you feel down, it might help to write down your feelings or thoughts. This can provide clarity and a sense of release. You could also practice grounding techniques, such as focusing on your senses, to help manage intense emotions.

Let's set some small, achievable goals for this week to help you continue moving forward:

1. **Connect with a Friend or Family Member**: Even if it's a short call or text, reach out to someone you trust. This can help you feel less isolated.
2. **Participate in a Support Group Session**: If you're comfortable, consider attending another session this week. It might feel easier with the experience you've already gained.
3. **Schedule a Call with Your Parents**: Try scheduling a call with them, perhaps starting with a light topic and then moving on to more serious matters.
4. **Engage in a Hobby**: Dedicate some time this week to an activity you enjoy, like salsa dancing, if possible, even if it's just a short session.

Remember, each small step forward is.

Patient: Thanks for breaking that down, Nova. It helps to have things laid out like that.

About the support group, there was one woman who shared her story about losing her husband. She talked about how she felt like she was drowning in grief at first, but over time, she found ways to cope and even started volunteering to help others. It made me realize that even though it feels like I'm stuck right now, there could be a way forward. I think I might go back next week.

As for talking to my parents, I've been rehearsing what I want to say, but I'm still nervous. I'll try to schedule a call with them this week, like you suggested. Maybe I can ease into it by asking about their day first.

I did try to get back into salsa dancing, but I felt really out of practice and almost embarrassed. I ended up leaving early. It was a bit of a setback, but I know I need to keep trying. Maybe I'll start with some online classes or just practice at home for now.

Your goals for this week sound doable. I'll try to reach out to a friend I haven't talked to in a while and see if they want to catch up. And I'll definitely aim to attend another support group session.

Thanks for the encouragement, Nova. It helps to have someone to talk through these things with.

Therapist: : You're welcome, Alicia. I'm glad the breakdown and the goals help you feel more grounded and focused. Here are a few additional tips to support you as you move forward:

1. **Support Group Attendance**: Attending another support group can be incredibly beneficial. You might find it helpful to arrive a bit earlier and get settled in before the meeting starts. This can give you a sense of control and reduce anxiety. Additionally, sharing your own story in a group, even if it's small, can be empowering and provide a sense of connection with others.

2. **Rehearsing and Talking to Parents**: Practicing what you want to say is a great strategy. You could also consider writing down your conversation points and using a script. This can give you confidence and help you stay on track. Remember, it's okay to be honest and vulnerable. Your parents care about you and want to support you. You might start by saying something like, "I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately and I'm not sure how to cope. I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences."

3. **Salsa Dancing**: Reconnecting with salsa dancing can be a great way to boost your mood and engage in a fun activity. Starting with online classes can be a low-pressure way to get back into it. You might also find it helpful to practice at home, even if it's just for a few minutes at a time. This can help you build confidence gradually.

4. **Connecting with Friends**: Reaching out to a friend can provide emotional support and a sense of connection. Sometimes, just chatting can help you feel less isolated and more connected. Consider scheduling a video call or a walk if you can.

5. **Self-Care and Grounding Techniques**: Continue to integrate self-care activities into your routine. This could include meditation, deep breathing exercises, or simply taking breaks to do something you enjoy. Grounding techniques can be particularly helpful during moments of intense emotion. For example, you can focus on five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.

Remember, healing is a process, and it's okay to have ups and downs. Keep setting small, achievable goals, and celebrate each step forward, no matter how small it may seem.

Let's schedule a follow-up session in a week to check in on your progress. How does that sound for you?

Patient: Thanks for the additional tips, Nova. They really help to break things down even further.

About the support group, I think arriving early is a good idea. It might help me feel less rushed and more prepared. I'll try to share a bit of my story next time too. It might be scary, but I know it could help.

For talking to my parents, I'll definitely use a script. I think that'll make it easier to stay focused and not get sidetracked by my nerves. I'll start with something light, like asking about their day, and then ease into the heavier stuff.

As for salsa dancing, I'll look into some online classes. It's a good way to ease back into it without feeling too much pressure. I might even try practicing at home with some music to get used to the movements again.

Reaching out to a friend sounds like a good plan. I'll schedule a video call with someone I haven't talked to in a while. It'll be nice to catch up and maybe even get some advice or just a listening ear.

I'll also keep up with the self-care and grounding techniques. They really do help, especially on days when I feel overwhelmed.

Scheduling a follow-up session in a week sounds good to me. It'll be helpful to check in and see how things are going. Thanks for all
