Therapist: Welcome back, Alicia! Congratulations on completing 13 sessions of CBT. It's wonderful to see the progress you've made. Before we dive into the new topics, I'd like to acknowledge and reinforce the progress you've made so far.

You've been actively engaging in salsa dancing classes and workplace social interactions, which has helped you build confidence and develop active listening skills. You've also started to explore the connection between salsa dancing and your family memories, particularly with your grandmother.

I'm particularly impressed with your understanding of being genuinely interested in others leading to more meaningful connections. You've also recognized that small talk can lead to deeper conversations and that being imperfect in social situations is acceptable.

As we move forward, I'd like to focus on a few areas that you've mentioned wanting to work on. You've expressed a desire to continue building your social confidence, particularly in preparing for upcoming social events. Can you tell me more about the upcoming work event that you mentioned last time? What are some concerns or anxieties you're experiencing around it?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a challenging journey, but I do feel like I'm making some progress, especially with the salsa dancing and social interactions. The upcoming work event is a big deal for me. It's a company-wide networking event where I'll be expected to mingle with senior executives and other team leads. I'm worried about making small talk and keeping the conversation going. I don't want to come across as awkward or uninterested. Plus, there's the added pressure of representing my team well. I'm also concerned about feeling out of place since I'm still relatively new to the leadership role.

Therapist: Alicia, I'm so proud of you for being honest about your concerns and anxieties around the upcoming work event. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge what's been holding you back.

First, let's break down your concerns. You're worried about making small talk and keeping the conversation going. You're also concerned about representing your team well and feeling out of place due to your relatively new leadership role. These are all valid concerns, but I want to challenge you to reframe them in a way that's more empowering.

Rather than focusing on avoiding awkwardness or appearing uninterested, let's focus on what you can control: being genuinely interested in the people you're talking to, actively listening, and asking open-ended questions. Remember, we've worked on these skills before, and I'm confident that you have the tools to navigate these conversations.

Regarding representing your team well, I want to remind you that you've already demonstrated your capabilities in your current role. You've been actively engaging with your colleagues, and your confidence in social situations has grown significantly. It's natural to feel some pressure, but try not to put too much emphasis on perfection. Instead, focus on being yourself and showing your team's value in the best way you can.

Lastly, let's address the feeling of being out of place due to your new leadership role. This is a common experience many people face, especially in a new position. Remember that everyone starts somewhere, and it's okay to learn and grow alongside others.

For our next steps, I'd like to propose a few exercises to help you feel more prepared for the work event. How do you feel about practicing some role-playing scenarios with me, where we simulate conversations with senior executives or team leads? This can help you build confidence in handling similar situations. What do you think?

Patient: That sounds like a good idea, Nova. Role-playing scenarios could definitely help me feel more prepared. I think practicing conversations with senior executives or team leads would be especially useful. It might help me get more comfortable with the types of questions they might ask or the topics they might bring up. I'm a bit nervous about it, but I know it's for the best. Let's go ahead with that.

Therapist: Alicia, I'm so glad you're open to role-playing scenarios. This will not only help you build confidence in handling similar situations but also allow you to practice active listening, asking open-ended questions, and being genuinely interested in others.

Before we begin, let's set some ground rules. Remember that this is a safe space for you to experiment and try new things without fear of judgment. I'll be playing the role of a senior executive or team lead, and I'll respond in a way that's challenging but still respectful.

To start, let's create a scenario. What type of conversation would you like to practice? Would you like to discuss a specific topic, such as a project or a company initiative, or would you prefer to practice more general small talk?

Also, remember that during our role-playing, I'll be providing you with feedback, but it won't be evaluative. Instead, it will be constructive, focusing on specific skills or areas where you can improve. You'll be able to learn and grow from these interactions.

Lastly, please keep in mind that our goal is not to create a perfect conversation but to focus on progress, not perfection. We're working on building your confidence and skills, and it's okay to make mistakes. Can you take a deep breath, relax, and let's begin?

Shall we start with a scenario?

Patient: Sure, let's start with a scenario where I'm discussing a project with a senior executive. I think that would be a good place to start since it's something I deal with regularly at work. Let's imagine I'm meeting with the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) to discuss the progress of a new AI project my team is working on. I'll take a deep breath and relax. Let's begin.
