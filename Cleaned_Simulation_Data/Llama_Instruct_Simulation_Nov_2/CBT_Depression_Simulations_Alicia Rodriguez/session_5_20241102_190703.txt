Therapist: Hello again, Alicia. It's wonderful to see you again in our 5th session. I'm glad we could review the progress we've made so far, and I'm impressed by how far you've come in just four sessions.

Before we dive into today's session, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made in implementing the strategies we discussed in our previous sessions. It takes a lot of courage and effort to set boundaries, reach out to new social connections, and adjust to a new environment.

What's been going on for you since our last session? Have you had a chance to try out any of the strategies we discussed, such as setting up a "shutdown ritual" or taking small steps towards salsa dancing? How have you been feeling about managing your work stress, building social connections, and dealing with feelings of isolation and grief?

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to be back. Since our last session, I did try setting up a "shutdown ritual" at work. I make sure to close my laptop and leave the office by 7 PM every day. It's been tough, but I'm trying to stick to it. I even had a brief conversation with my manager about it, and surprisingly, they were supportive.

As for salsa dancing, I haven't gone to any classes yet, but I did join a local salsa group on social media. It's a small step, but it feels manageable.

Managing work stress has been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days are better than others. I still get those moments of intense pressure and self-doubt, especially when I make a small mistake. But I'm trying to remind myself that it's okay to not be perfect all the time.

Dealing with isolation and grief is still hard. I miss my grandmother a lot, and sometimes it feels like the loneliness is overwhelming. But I'm trying to be patient with myself and take things one day at a time.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your experiences and progress, Alicia. It takes a lot of courage to try new things and be vulnerable about your challenges.

It sounds like you've been making some great attempts to implement the strategies we discussed in our previous session. Setting up a "shutdown ritual" and having a supportive conversation with your manager is a great start to establishing better work-life balance. And joining a local salsa group on social media is a small but significant step towards building social connections.

I'm also glad to hear that you're being kind to yourself and reminding yourself that it's okay to not be perfect all the time. That's a huge accomplishment, and it takes a lot of self-compassion to acknowledge and accept those moments of self-doubt.

However, it also sounds like you're still struggling with feelings of isolation and grief. That's completely understandable, especially when you're adjusting to a new environment and navigating the loss of a loved one. Can you tell me more about what's been going on for you in terms of feelings of isolation and grief? What are some of the specific things that have been triggering these emotions, and how have you been coping with them?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's been a bit of a mixed bag, honestly. The shutdown ritual has helped a little, but I still find myself thinking about work even when I'm not there. I guess old habits die hard.

As for the isolation and grief, it's been tough. I think the main trigger is just being in a new city where I don't have many friends or family. Every time I walk around and see people with their friends or families, it makes me miss my grandmother even more. I feel like I'm constantly comparing myself to others and feeling like I'm falling short.

I've been trying to cope by throwing myself into work more, but that just makes me feel even more exhausted and disconnected. I've also been reading more sci-fi novels to escape, but it's not really helping with the loneliness. I guess I'm just trying to find a balance, but it's hard when everything feels so overwhelming.

Therapist: Alicia, I can sense the complexity of your emotions and the challenges you're facing. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, especially when adjusting to a new environment and dealing with the loss of a loved one.

Firstly, let's acknowledge that it's okay to still be struggling with these feelings, even after making progress in previous sessions. It's a sign of your growth and willingness to confront your emotions.

Regarding your shutdown ritual, it's great that you're making an effort to disconnect from work-related tasks outside of work hours. However, the fact that you're still thinking about work when you're not there might indicate that you're still not fully disconnecting. We might need to explore ways to further establish a clear separation between your work and personal life.

Regarding your feelings of isolation and grief, I want to gently challenge the thought patterns that are making you feel like you're falling short and comparing yourself to others. These thoughts can be incredibly damaging and perpetuate feelings of loneliness.

Let's work together to reframe these thoughts in a more compassionate and realistic way. Instead of comparing yourself to others, can we focus on what you can control and what you're doing to build connections and a sense of community in your new city? Your interest in salsa dancing is a great start, and we can build on that.

Additionally, I'd like to suggest an exercise to help you cope with feelings of loneliness and isolation. Have you considered practicing acts of self-care that bring you joy and comfort? This might include things like taking a relaxing bath, practicing yoga, or even just taking a short walk outside. By prioritizing your own needs and engaging in activities that bring you pleasure, we can work on reducing feelings of loneliness and increasing feelings of connection to yourself.

Lastly, let's talk about the idea of throwing yourself into work to cope with emotions. While it might provide temporary relief, it's likely contributing to your exhaustion and feelings of disconnection. We might need to explore alternative coping strategies that don't rely on overworking.

How do these suggestions sound, Alicia? Are there any specific areas you'd like to focus on or any questions you have?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your understanding and suggestions. I think the idea of reframing my thoughts and focusing on what I can control is something I need to work on. It's easy to get caught up in comparing myself to others, especially when I see people who seem to have it all together.

As for self-care, I haven't really been doing much of that lately. I guess I've been so focused on work and trying to cope that I've neglected taking care of myself. I like the idea of taking a relaxing bath or going for a walk. It sounds simple, but it might help me feel more grounded.

Regarding overworking, I know it's not healthy, but it's become such a habit. I feel like I need to prove myself, especially in my new role. But I also know that it's not sustainable. Maybe we can explore some alternative coping strategies that don't involve work.

I think focusing on reframing my thoughts and finding healthier ways to cope with my emotions would be a good place to start. Do you have any specific exercises or techniques in mind for reframing thoughts and finding alternative coping strategies?

Therapist: It sounds like we're making progress, Alicia, and that's something to be proud of. I'm glad you're willing to explore new ways of thinking and coping.

One exercise we can try is called "thought records." It's a simple yet powerful tool to help you identify and challenge negative thought patterns. Here's how it works:

1. Whenever you notice yourself thinking something negative or critical, write it down in a journal or on a sticky note.
2. Next to that thought, write down the evidence that supports it. For example, if you think, "I'm a failure," you might write down specific examples of times when you felt like a failure.
3. Then, write down alternative, more balanced thoughts that challenge the original negative thought. For instance, "I made a mistake, but I can learn from it and move forward."
4. Finally, rate how convincing the original negative thought was, and then rate how convincing the alternative thought is.

This exercise can help you become more aware of your thought patterns and develop more compassionate and realistic ways of thinking.

As for alternative coping strategies, we can explore a few options. Have you considered engaging in activities that bring you a sense of flow or engagement, such as hobbies or creative pursuits? These can help distract you from negative thoughts and emotions while also providing a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment.

We can also work on developing a "self-care menu" that includes a list of activities that bring you joy and comfort. This could include things like taking a relaxing bath, practicing yoga, or simply taking a short walk outside.

Lastly, let's talk about your need to prove yourself in your new role. I'm not sure if this is related to your desire for perfectionism or something else, but it's worth exploring. Can you tell me more about what drives this need to prove yourself?

Also, I'd like to suggest a homework assignment: For the next week, commit to engaging in at least one self-care activity per day. It can be as simple as taking a few deep breaths or going for a short walk. See if this helps you feel more grounded and connected to yourself.

What do you think, Alicia? Is this something you're willing to try?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. The thought records exercise sounds interesting. I think it could help me become more aware of my negative thoughts and find ways to challenge them. I'll definitely give it a try.

As for alternative coping strategies, I do enjoy coding and reading sci-fi novels, but I haven't really been making time for them lately. I guess I could start by setting aside some time each day to do something I enjoy, whether it's coding a personal project or reading a new book.

Regarding the need to prove myself, I think it's a combination of things. Part of it is definitely my perfectionism, but I also feel like I need to prove myself to my team and my manager, especially since I'm one of the few women and even fewer Latinas in a leadership position. It's like I'm constantly trying to justify my promotion and prove that I deserve to be there.

I'm willing to try the self-care homework assignment. I think it's a good idea to start small and commit to one self-care activity per day. It might help me feel more balanced and less overwhelmed.

Thanks for the suggestions, Nova. I'm looking forward to seeing how these strategies work for me.

Therapist: It sounds like we've made some great progress, Alicia. I'm impressed by your willingness to try new strategies and exercises. The thought records exercise can be a powerful tool in helping you become more aware of your negative thoughts and develop more compassionate and realistic ways of thinking.

I'm also glad to hear that you're willing to explore alternative coping strategies, such as engaging in activities that bring you a sense of flow or engagement, like coding or reading. And setting aside time each day for self-care is a great way to prioritize your own needs and well-being.

Regarding your need to prove yourself, it's understandable that you feel pressure to justify your promotion and prove yourself in a male-dominated industry. However, I want to gently challenge the idea that you need to constantly prove yourself. What if, instead of trying to prove yourself, you focus on being your authentic self and delivering high-quality work? What if you focus on building relationships with your colleagues and manager, rather than trying to prove yourself to them?

Let's work together to develop a more compassionate and realistic mindset around your self-worth and identity. You are not defined by your job or your position, but by your values, passions, and strengths. Can you tell me more about what you value most about yourself and your work? What are your core strengths and passions that drive you?

Also, I'd like to suggest a thought experiment: Imagine yourself in a hypothetical scenario where you've achieved a high level of success and recognition in your industry. What would you be proud of? What qualities and strengths would you attribute to your success? What would you be doing in that scenario to feel fulfilled and satisfied?

Let's explore this thought experiment together, and see if we can uncover some insights about what truly drives you and gives you a sense of purpose.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your encouragement and support. I think the thought experiment you suggested is a good way to explore what truly drives me and gives me a sense of purpose.

When I imagine myself in a hypothetical scenario where I've achieved a high level of success and recognition in my industry, I think I would be proud of my ability to innovate and solve complex problems. I've always been passionate about technology and using it to make a positive impact on people's lives. I would also be proud of my resilience and determination, especially in the face of challenges and setbacks.

In that scenario, I would be doing work that allows me to use my creativity and problem-solving skills to develop innovative solutions. I would also be mentoring and supporting other women and minorities in the tech industry, helping them navigate the challenges and barriers they face.

I think these qualities and strengths are what drive me and give me a sense of purpose. I value my ability to innovate, solve problems, and make a positive impact. I also value my resilience and determination, which have helped me overcome many obstacles in my career.

I'm starting to see that my self-worth and identity are not solely tied to my job or position, but to my values, passions, and strengths. It's a work in progress, but I'm willing to explore this more and develop a more compassionate and realistic mindset around my self-worth and identity.

Therapist: It seems like we've made some excellent progress in this session, Alicia. I'm so proud of you for being willing to explore new strategies and exercises. It takes a lot of courage to confront negative thought patterns and develop more compassionate and realistic ways of thinking.

Firstly, let's summarize the key takeaways from this session:

1. We explored the thought records exercise, which can help you become more aware of your negative thoughts and develop more compassionate and realistic ways of thinking.
2. We discussed alternative coping strategies, such as engaging in activities that bring you a sense of flow or engagement, like coding or reading. We also talked about setting aside time each day for self-care.

I'd also like you to reflect on your core strengths and passions, and how they align with your values and goals. Additionally, let's set a goal to work on building your self-care routine and prioritizing your own needs and well-being.

Before we end this session, I'd like to leave you with a few final thoughts:

I think the thought records exercise will be a good way to become more aware of my negative thoughts and develop more compassionate and realistic ways of thinking. I'll definitely keep practicing it and see how it goes.

As for self-care, I'm committed to engaging in at least one self-care activity per day. I think it's important to prioritize my own needs and well-being, especially given how much I've been neglecting myself lately.

Reflecting on my core strengths and passions has been eye-opening. It's helped me see that my self-worth and identity are not solely tied to my job or position, but to my values, passions, and strengths. I'm looking forward to exploring this more and developing a more compassionate and realistic mindset around my self-worth and identity.

I think the final thoughts you shared are really important. It's easy to forget that my self-worth and identity are not solely tied to my job or position, and that it's okay to make mistakes and face challenges. I'll continue to practice self-compassion and challenge negative thought patterns.

Before we wrap up, I'd like to give you a homework assignment to work on building your self-care routine. For the next week, commit to engaging in at least one self-care activity per day. It can be as simple as taking a few deep breaths, going for a short walk, or practicing yoga. The key is to prioritize your own needs and well-being.

You have the power to reframe your thoughts, develop more compassionate and realistic ways of thinking, and prioritize your own needs and well-being.

Before we end this session, I'd like to leave you with a quote from Brené Brown: "The most courageous act is still to think for yourself. Aloud."

Remember to be brave and speak your truth, Alicia. You are capable of amazing things, and I'm honored to be a part of your journey.

Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or explore before we end this session?
