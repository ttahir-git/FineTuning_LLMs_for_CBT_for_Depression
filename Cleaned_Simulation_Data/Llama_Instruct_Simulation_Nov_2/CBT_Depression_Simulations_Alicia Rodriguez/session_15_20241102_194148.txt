Therapist: Hello Alicia. It's great to see you again for our 16th session. I'm glad you've been reflecting on our previous conversations and practicing some of the techniques we've discussed.

Before we dive into what's been happening since our last session, I want to acknowledge how brave it is to continue working through these challenges. It's clear that you're committed to making progress and improving your well-being.

Can you tell me a bit about what's been on your mind since our last session? What are some of the thoughts, feelings, or experiences that have come up for you?

Patient: Hi Nova. Thanks for the acknowledgment, it means a lot. Since our last session, I've been trying to practice those techniques, but it's been tough. I've been listening to salsa music at home, which has been nice, but I haven't actually gone back to dancing yet. I keep making excuses, like being too tired or not having the right clothes.

Work has been really intense. My team is working on a big project, and I've been putting in long hours. I've noticed that when I start feeling self-doubt, I try to use the reframing technique, but it doesn't always stick. I still catch myself thinking, "What if they find out I'm not as good as they think?"

I've also been feeling really lonely. I miss my grandmother a lot, and it's hard to connect with people here. I tried to reach out to a coworker for coffee, but I ended up canceling at the last minute because I felt anxious about it.

So, yeah, it's been a mix of trying to make progress and feeling stuck at the same time.

Therapist: Alicia, it sounds like you've been facing a lot of challenges since our last session. It's great that you've been making an effort to practice the techniques we discussed, even if it's been tough. It's also okay that you're not feeling perfect about it.

It sounds like your self-doubt is still a significant issue for you, especially in the context of your work. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to be a leader, and it's normal to feel uncertain at times. The thought "What if they find out I'm not as good as they think?" is a common one, but it's also a thought that can be reframed. Let's explore ways to reframe that thought together.

Regarding your salsa dancing, it's understandable that you're hesitant to start again. However, I want to ask you to consider what's driving your excuses. Are you afraid of failure, or are you afraid of something else? Sometimes, our excuses can be a way of protecting ourselves from feelings of vulnerability or discomfort.

It's also great that you're acknowledging your loneliness. Feeling lonely can be a really painful experience, especially when it's related to the loss of a loved one like your grandmother. It might be helpful to explore ways to connect with others in a more meaningful way, rather than just trying to fit in with a coworker's plans. What do you think might be one small step you could take this week to connect with someone in a more authentic way?

Lastly, it's clear that you're feeling stuck in a lot of ways. Can you think of one small thing that you've been wanting to do, but have been putting off? What would happen if you took a small step towards doing that thing this week?

Patient: Thanks for understanding, Nova. It helps to know that it's normal to feel uncertain as a leader. When you say to reframe the thought "What if they find out I'm not as good as they think?", can you give me an example of how I might do that? I'm not sure how to change that thought.

About the salsa dancing, I think you're right that I'm afraid of feeling vulnerable. I haven't danced in a while, and I'm worried I won't be as good as I used to be. It feels like a big step to go back, even though I know it could be good for me.

Regarding connecting with others, I think I need to be more intentional about it. Maybe I could join a salsa class or a book club. I've been wanting to join a salsa class for a while, but I keep putting it off. What would happen if I took a small step towards doing that thing this week? I guess I'd feel more connected and maybe less lonely.

Lastly, I've been wanting to start a small side project related to AI ethics, something I'm passionate about but haven't had the time for. I could spend just an hour this week researching and outlining the project. That feels doable and might give me a sense of accomplishment.

Therapist: Alicia, it's great that you're open to exploring new ways to reframe your thoughts. When we encounter a negative thought like "What if they find out I'm not as good as they think?", it can be helpful to challenge it by asking yourself some questions. For example, you could ask yourself:

* What's the evidence for this thought? Is it based on past experiences or assumptions?
* Is this thought serving me in some way? Is it helping me prepare for a specific scenario or is it holding me back?
* What would be the worst that could happen if my team found out I'm not as good as they think? Would it really be catastrophic?
* What would I say to a friend who had a similar thought? Would I encourage them to think that way?

By asking yourself these questions, you can start to challenge the negative thought and reframe it in a more balanced way. For example, you could say to yourself, "I'm doing my best with the resources I have, and I'm confident in my abilities. I'm not perfect, but I'm learning and growing as a leader."

Regarding your salsa dancing, it's great that you're recognizing your fears and excuses. Remember that vulnerability can be a good thing! It can lead to growth and connection with others. Taking small steps towards dancing again, like joining a class or finding a dance partner, can help you build confidence and momentum.

I love that you're thinking about joining a salsa class! That's a great way to connect with others who share your passion for dance. And your idea to start a small side project on AI ethics is also exciting. Spending just an hour this week researching and outlining the project can be a great way to start making progress and feeling more accomplished.

Let's set a specific goal for this week. Can you commit to taking that hour to research and outline your side project? And maybe, just maybe, you can also take a small step towards joining a salsa class or finding a dance partner. What do you think?

Patient: Alicia, it's clear that you're feeling a lot of pressure and self-doubt, especially about your work. I want to remind you that it's okay to not be perfect. You're doing your best, and that's enough. Let's take a moment to challenge that negative thought.

Think about a time when you felt confident and capable at work. What were you doing? What skills were you using? How did it feel? Now, try to bring that feeling of confidence into your current situation. You can say to yourself, "I have done great work before, and I can do it again. I am growing as a leader and learning every day."

It's also great that you're considering ways to connect with others, even if it's something small like joining a salsa class. Reconnecting with something you love, like dancing, can be a powerful way to reduce loneliness and build confidence.

And I love your idea about starting a side project on AI ethics. It sounds like a meaningful and fulfilling project that could also contribute to your professional growth. Just taking that first small step of researching and outlining the project can make a big difference.

Let's break it down into actionable steps:
- This week, commit to spending an hour researching and outlining your AI ethics project.
- Consider taking a small step towards joining a salsa class or finding a dance partner.

Therapist: It seems we've reached a point in the session where we can reflect on the progress made and set goals for the next steps. Let's summarize the key points:

1. Alicia has been practicing the techniques we discussed in previous sessions, including thought reframing, self-compassion statements, and breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable steps.
2. She has been experiencing self-doubt and uncertainty, especially in the context of her work as a leader.
3. She has been hesitant to start dancing again, fearing vulnerability and feelings of not being good enough.
4. She has been feeling lonely and disconnected from others, and is eager to take small steps towards connecting with others and finding meaningful activities.
5. She has identified a passion project on AI ethics that she'd like to start, but has been putting it off due to lack of time and self-doubt.

Now, let's set some specific goals for the next steps:

* This week, Alicia will commit to spending an hour researching and outlining her AI ethics project.
* She will take a small step towards joining a salsa class or finding a dance partner.
* She will continue to practice thought reframing and self-compassion statements to help manage her self-doubt and uncertainty.
* She will make a conscious effort to connect with others and engage in activities that bring her joy and a sense of purpose.

How do these goals feel to you, Alicia? Are there any other areas you'd like to focus on or any additional goals you'd like to set for yourself?

Patient: Those goals sound good, Nova. I think they're manageable and will help me make some progress.

I'll commit to spending an hour this week on my AI ethics project. I've been wanting to start it for a while, and I think it will be fulfilling.

As for the salsa class, I'll look into joining one this week. It's something I've been putting off, but I know it could be good for me.

I'll also keep practicing thought reframing and self-compassion statements. It's been helping a bit, but I still have moments of self-doubt.

Connecting with others is still a challenge, but I'll try to be more intentional about it. Maybe I can reach out to a coworker for a casual coffee or join a book club.

Thanks for the support, Nova. It helps to have these goals to work towards.
