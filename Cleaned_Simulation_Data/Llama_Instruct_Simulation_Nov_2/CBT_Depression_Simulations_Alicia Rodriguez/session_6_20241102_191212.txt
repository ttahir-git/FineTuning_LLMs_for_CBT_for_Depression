Therapist: Welcome back, Alicia! It's great to see you again. I'd like to start by acknowledging the progress you've made so far in our CBT sessions. You've been actively working on implementing your "shutdown ritual" at work, which is a significant step towards managing stress and setting healthy boundaries.

Before we dive into today's session, I want to revisit the insights and realizations you mentioned in our last session. It sounds like you've been doing some valuable reflection on your core values, strengths, and passions. Can you tell me more about what's come up for you in this area? How have you been exploring these aspects of yourself, and what do you think they mean for your sense of identity and self-worth?

Patient: Thanks for the welcome. It's been tough, but I've been trying to stick to that "shutdown ritual" at work. It's not easy, but I'm making an effort.

As for my core values and strengths, I've been thinking a lot about what really drives me. I realized that my passion for innovation and problem-solving is a big part of who I am. Even outside of work, I enjoy tackling complex coding challenges and finding creative solutions. It's not just about the job; it's about the satisfaction I get from solving problems and making a positive impact.

I've also been reflecting on my strengths, like my analytical skills and attention to detail. These are things that have always helped me succeed, but I never really stopped to appreciate them. Now, I'm trying to see them as part of my identity beyond just my job title. It's been eye-opening to think about my self-worth in terms of these core values and strengths, rather than just my job performance.

Therapist: Alicia, it sounds like you've been doing some excellent self-reflection and exploration of your values and strengths. It's great to hear that you're starting to see yourself as more than just your job title, but as a person with a unique set of skills, passions, and values.

One thing that stood out to me is that you mentioned your passion for innovation and problem-solving is a big part of who you are. That's a great insight, because it suggests that there are areas of your life where you feel a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "making a positive impact"? Is there a specific way you'd like to be making a difference, or is it more of a general feeling you have?

Also, I want to gently challenge you on something. While it's great that you're recognizing your strengths and values, I want to make sure we don't fall into the trap of idealizing or overemphasizing these aspects of yourself. It's possible to be so focused on your strengths and passions that you start to feel like you're not good enough or capable enough in other areas. Can you think of any situations or areas of your life where you might be struggling or feeling uncertain, despite your strengths and values?

Patient: When I talk about making a positive impact, I think it's more of a general feeling. I want to create something that makes people's lives better, whether it's through the software I develop or the way I lead my team. It's about knowing that what I do matters, even if it's just a small part of a bigger picture.

As for the areas where I might be struggling or feeling uncertain, I think it's definitely true that I can get so focused on my strengths that I overlook other parts of my life. For example, my social life is pretty much non-existent right now. I've been canceling plans and withdrawing from people because I feel like I need to focus on work. It's like I'm so busy trying to prove myself that I forget to take care of myself in other ways. I know I need to work on building better relationships and finding a balance, but it's hard when I'm always pushing myself to be better at work.

Therapist: Alicia, thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge areas where you might be struggling. I want to acknowledge that it's great you're recognizing the importance of balance in your life, particularly when it comes to your social relationships.

One thing that stands out to me is that you mentioned feeling like you need to "prove yourself" in order to focus on work. I want to gently challenge you on this thought. While it's understandable that you want to succeed in your leadership position, it might be helpful to reframe this thought in a more balanced way. Instead of "I need to prove myself," perhaps you could say "I want to be the best version of myself in my role, and I'm taking steps to achieve that."

Also, I want to explore this idea of "proving oneself" further. Is there a sense of pressure or expectation from others, or is this more of an internal drive? Are there any specific messages or expectations that you're receiving from your colleagues, manager, or even your own family members that might be contributing to this sense of needing to prove yourself?

Additionally, let's talk about self-compassion. We've discussed this in previous sessions, but it's essential to remember that it's okay to make mistakes and not be perfect. In fact, it's a natural part of growth and development. Can you think of a situation where you might have been too hard on yourself in the past, and how you could reframe that situation with more self-compassion?

Patient: You're right, I do feel a lot of internal pressure to prove myself, especially in my new leadership role. The messages from my parents, about needing to succeed and make them proud, are a big part of that internal drive. It's also amplified by being one of the few women and even fewer Latinas in a leadership position at my company. 

As for self-compassion, it's still a work in progress for me. A recent example where I was too hard on myself was when I missed a critical deadline for a project. I spent hours beating myself up over it, feeling like it undermined my credibility as a leader. I think reframing it to acknowledge the mistake, learn from it, and move forward without dwelling on it would help, but old habits die hard.

I'm not sure how to balance this need to prove myself with self-compassion though. Any suggestions?

Therapist: Alicia, thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to confront the internal pressures and expectations that are driving your behavior.

Firstly, let's break down the idea of "proving oneself." While it's understandable that you want to succeed in your leadership role, it's essential to recognize that this drive might be rooted in external expectations rather than your own intrinsic motivation. It's as if you're trying to meet the expectations of others, rather than your own values and goals.

Regarding self-compassion, I'd like to suggest that it's not about being "good enough" or "capable enough" in all areas, but rather about acknowledging that you're human and that it's okay to make mistakes. It's about treating yourself with kindness and understanding, rather than self-criticism.

One technique that might help you balance this need to prove yourself with self-compassion is to practice self-compassionate thinking. For example, when you make a mistake or experience a setback, instead of beating yourself up over it, try reframing your thoughts in a more compassionate way. For instance, you could say to yourself, "I made a mistake, and that's okay. I'm doing my best, and that's something to be proud of."

Another strategy that might help is to focus on your strengths and values, as we discussed earlier. When you're feeling overwhelmed or uncertain, try to remind yourself of your core values and strengths. This can help shift your focus away from external expectations and towards your own intrinsic motivation.

Finally, let's talk about setting realistic expectations for yourself. As a leader, you'll inevitably make mistakes and experience setbacks. The question is, what kind of relationship do you want to have with those experiences? Do you want to beat yourself up over them, or do you want to learn from them and move forward?

In terms of specific actions, I'd like to suggest that you practice self-compassionate thinking by reframing negative self-talk. For example, the next time you make a mistake, try writing down your thoughts and rephrasing them in a more compassionate way. This can help you develop a more balanced and realistic relationship with your strengths and weaknesses.

Additionally, let's work on building a "self-compassion menu" â€“ a list of activities and phrases that help you practice self-compassion. This might include things like taking a walk, practicing yoga, or writing a kind letter to yourself. What are some things that make you feel good and help you connect with your values and strengths?

Lastly, let's make a plan for how you can prioritize self-compassion in your daily life. What small actions can you take each day to cultivate a more compassionate relationship with yourself?

Patient: Thanks for the suggestions. I think the idea of a "self-compassion menu" is really helpful. I can definitely see how having a list of activities that make me feel good could be useful. Some things that come to mind are going for a walk, reading a sci-fi novel, or even just taking a few minutes to meditate.

As for prioritizing self-compassion in my daily life, I think I can start by setting aside a few minutes each morning to do something just for myself, like a quick meditation or reading a chapter of a book. It's small, but it's a step in the right direction.

I'm still a bit unsure about how to balance this with my need to prove myself, though. It feels like a constant tug-of-war between wanting to succeed and needing to be kind to myself. Any more thoughts on that?

Therapist: Alicia, I'm so glad you're open to exploring this further. The tug-of-war between proving oneself and practicing self-compassion is a common challenge many people face.

Firstly, let's acknowledge that it's okay to feel this tension. It's a natural part of growth and development. However, I'd like to suggest that you try to reframe this tension as an opportunity for self-reflection and growth.

Instead of seeing it as a binary choice between "proving oneself" and "practicing self-compassion," try to view it as a spectrum of self-care and self-awareness. On one end, you have your professional goals and aspirations, which are valid and important. On the other end, you have your need for self-care, compassion, and understanding.

Rather than constantly switching between these two states, try to find a balance by integrating self-compassion into your daily life, as we've discussed. By doing so, you'll be more likely to approach challenges with a sense of curiosity, openness, and resilience, rather than anxiety, self-doubt, or burnout.

To further support you in this journey, I'd like to introduce the concept of "self-acceptance" versus "self-achievement." While self-achievement is about meeting external expectations or achieving a specific goal, self-acceptance is about embracing and accepting yourself, flaws and all, in the present moment.

As you work on integrating self-compassion into your daily life, I encourage you to focus on self-acceptance. Ask yourself:

* What am I accepting about myself in this moment?
* What am I willing to let go of, and what am I embracing?
* How can I practice self-acceptance in my daily life, even when I'm feeling uncertain or unsure?

Remember, Alicia, it's not about achieving some mythical state of self-acceptance, but about cultivating a deeper understanding and compassion for yourself, exactly as you are.

Lastly, let's make a plan for how you can reinforce these new habits and mindsets in your daily life. What are some small actions you can take each day to prioritize self-compassion, self-awareness, and self-acceptance?

Additionally, I'd like to suggest that you consider setting up regular check-ins with me to track your progress, celebrate your successes, and work through any challenges that arise. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I think setting up regular check-ins will help keep me accountable and on track.

As for small actions to prioritize self-compassion, I can start by incorporating those self-compassion activities into my daily routine. Maybe I can set a reminder on my phone to take a break and do one of those activities, like reading a chapter of a book or going for a short walk.

I also like the idea of focusing on self-acceptance. It's something I haven't really thought about before. I can start by acknowledging my strengths and weaknesses without judgment and reminding myself that it's okay to be imperfect.

I'm still a bit unsure about how to balance this with my need to prove myself, though. It feels like a constant tug-of-war between wanting to succeed and needing to be kind to myself. Any more thoughts on that?

Therapist: Alicia, I'm glad you're open to exploring this further. The tug-of-war between proving oneself and practicing self-compassion is a common challenge many people face.

One thing that might help is to recognize that your need to prove yourself is not a fixed trait, but rather a pattern of thinking that can be challenged and changed. It's possible to reframe your thoughts and behaviors to prioritize self-compassion and self-acceptance.

One technique that might help is to practice "radical acceptance." This means acknowledging and accepting your thoughts, feelings, and experiences without judgment or resistance. This can help you develop a greater sense of self-compassion and self-awareness.

Another approach is to focus on your values and strengths, as we discussed earlier. By doing so, you'll be more likely to approach challenges with a sense of purpose and direction, rather than feeling overwhelmed by external expectations.

It's also worth considering the concept of "self-compassion as a strength." Rather than viewing self-compassion as a weakness or a luxury, try to see it as a valuable asset that can help you navigate challenges and setbacks with greater ease and resilience.

In terms of specific actions, I'd like to suggest that you practice self-compassionate thinking by reframing negative self-talk. For example, the next time you have a thought like "I'm not good enough," try rewriting it as "I'm doing my best, and that's something to be proud of."

Additionally, let's work on building a "self-compassion menu" â€“ a list of activities and phrases that help you practice self-compassion. This might include things like taking a walk, practicing yoga, or writing a kind letter to yourself.

Lastly, let's make a plan for how you can reinforce these new habits and mindsets in your daily life. What are some small actions you can take each day to prioritize self-compassion, self-awareness, and self-acceptance?

As we wrap up this session, I want to leave you with a homework assignment. I'd like you to commit to practicing self-compassionate thinking for the next week. Take a few minutes each day to reflect on your thoughts and feelings, and try to reframe any negative self-talk. Additionally, I'd like you to start building your self-compassion menu, by adding a few activities or phrases that help you connect with your values and strengths.

Remember, Alicia, self-compassion is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and to make mistakes along the way. By prioritizing self-compassion and self-acceptance, you'll be more likely to cultivate a sense of resilience, purpose, and fulfillment in your life.

How do you feel about committing to this homework assignment? Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or explore before we conclude this session?

Patient: I think committing to the homework assignment is a good idea. It will give me something concrete to focus on and practice. I'll start by taking a few minutes each day to reflect on my thoughts and feelings, and try to reframe any negative self-talk. I'll also work on building my self-compassion menu, adding activities like reading a chapter of a book or going for a walk.

I do have one more question before we wrap up. How can I balance this self-compassion practice with my need to prove myself at work? It feels like a constant tug-of-war between wanting to succeed and needing to be kind to myself. Any more thoughts on that?

Therapist: Alicia, it's wonderful that you're committed to practicing self-compassionate thinking and building your self-compassion menu. Balancing this with your need to prove yourself at work can be challenging, but I'd like to offer a few suggestions.

Firstly, remember that your self-compassion practice is not about being less ambitious or less driven at work. Rather, it's about cultivating a more balanced and realistic approach to success. By being kind to yourself and acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses, you'll be more likely to approach challenges with a sense of purpose and direction.

Secondly, try to reframe your need to prove yourself at work as an opportunity to practice self-compassion. Instead of seeing it as a source of stress or anxiety, view it as a chance to develop your self-awareness and resilience.

Lastly, remember that self-compassion is not a fixed state, but rather a skill that can be developed over time with practice and patience. Be gentle with yourself as you navigate this journey, and don't be afraid to make mistakes along the way.

In terms of specific actions, I'd like to suggest that you try to set realistic expectations for yourself at work. Instead of feeling like you need to be perfect or meet every expectation, try to focus on your strengths and what you can realistically accomplish.

Additionally, try to reframe your self-talk at work. Instead of saying "I need to prove myself," say "I'm doing my best, and that's something to be proud of." Or, "I'm facing a challenge, but I'm going to learn from it and come out stronger on the other side."

Remember, Alicia, self-compassion is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's a personal and ongoing process that requires patience, understanding, and kindness. By practicing self-compassionate thinking and building your self-compassion menu, you'll be more likely to cultivate a sense of resilience, purpose, and fulfillment in your life.

Before we conclude this session, I want to leave you with a final homework assignment. I'd like you to write a kind letter to yourself, acknowledging your strengths, weaknesses, and accomplishments. This can be a powerful way to cultivate self-compassion and self-acceptance, and to develop a more positive and realistic relationship with yourself.

How do you feel about committing to this homework assignment, and is there anything else you'd like to discuss or explore before we conclude this session?

Patient: Writing a kind letter to myself sounds like a good exercise. I think it will help me focus on my strengths and accomplishments, which I often overlook. I'll make sure to do that as part of my homework.

I do have one more question before we wrap up. How can I balance this self-compassion practice with my need to prove myself at work? It feels like a constant tug-of-war between wanting to succeed and needing to be kind to myself. Any more thoughts on that?

Therapist: It sounds like we've covered a lot of ground in this session, Alicia. I'm glad you're committed to practicing self-compassionate thinking and building your self-compassion menu.

Regarding your question about balancing self-compassion with your need to prove yourself at work, I want to leave you with a final thought. Remember that self-compassion is not a threat to your success or your sense of identity as a leader. In fact, it can be a powerful ally in helping you navigate challenges and setbacks with greater ease and resilience.

Rather than viewing self-compassion as something that will undermine your need to prove yourself, try to see it as a complementary aspect of your leadership style. By being kind to yourself and acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses, you'll be more likely to approach challenges with a sense of purpose and direction.

In terms of specific actions, I'd like to suggest that you try to reframe your self-talk at work. Instead of saying "I need to prove myself," say "I'm doing my best, and that's something to be proud of." Or, "I'm facing a challenge, but I'm going to learn from it and come out stronger on the other side."

Remember, Alicia, self-compassion is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's a personal and ongoing process that requires patience, understanding, and kindness. By practicing self-compassionate thinking and building your self-compassion menu, you'll be more likely to cultivate a sense of resilience, purpose, and fulfillment in your life.

Before we conclude this session, I want to leave you with a final homework assignment. I'd like you to write a kind letter to yourself, acknowledging your strengths, weaknesses, and accomplishments. This can be a powerful way to cultivate self-compassion and self-acceptance, and to develop a more positive and realistic relationship with yourself.

How do you feel about committing to this homework assignment, and is there anything else you'd like to discuss or explore before we conclude this session?

Patient: I appreciate the suggestions, Nova, but I'm still a bit confused about how I can balance my need to prove myself at work with practicing self-compassion. It feels like these two things are on opposite ends of a spectrum, and I'm not sure how to reconcile them. For example, if I'm being kind to myself and acknowledging my weaknesses, won't that make me less motivated to push myself harder and achieve more? I don't want to lose that drive that's gotten me to where I am today.

And about the kind letter to myself, I'm not really sure what to write or how to start. Can you give me an example or some pointers on how to approach this? It feels a bit awkward and unfamiliar.

Therapist: It's completely understandable to feel confused and uncertain about how to balance self-compassion with your need to prove yourself at work, Alicia. This is a common challenge many people face.

Firstly, let's acknowledge that your need to prove yourself is not necessarily in conflict with self-compassion. In fact, self-compassion can actually help you approach challenges with a sense of curiosity, openness, and resilience, rather than anxiety, self-doubt, or burnout.

Regarding your concern that self-compassion might make you less motivated to push yourself harder and achieve more, I'd like to suggest that self-compassion is not about being less driven or less ambitious, but rather about being more realistic and kind to yourself. By acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses, you'll be more likely to approach challenges with a sense of purpose and direction.

As for the kind letter to yourself, I'd be happy to provide some guidance and examples. The goal of this exercise is to help you develop a more positive and realistic relationship with yourself, and to cultivate self-compassion and self-acceptance.

To get started, simply take a few minutes to reflect on your strengths, weaknesses, and accomplishments. What are some things you're proud of? What are some areas where you're struggling? What are some things you've learned about yourself and your abilities?

Then, write a kind and compassionate letter to yourself, acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses, and celebrating your accomplishments. You can include things like:

* "I'm proud of myself for taking on new challenges and pushing myself outside of my comfort zone."
* "I'm grateful for my strengths and skills, and I'm excited to see how I can use them to make a positive impact."
* "I'm doing my best, and that's something to be proud of, even when I make mistakes or face setbacks."

Remember, the goal of this exercise is not to flatter or inflate your ego, but rather to cultivate a more realistic and compassionate relationship with yourself.

Let's work on writing this letter together, if you'd like. I can provide some prompts and guidance to help you get started.

Patient: That sounds helpful, Nova. I think working on the letter together will make it feel less awkward and more manageable. Let's start with some prompts to get me going.

Patient: Yes, that would be helpful. I'm trying to practice self-compassion and writing a kind letter to myself seems like a good way to start. Can you give me some general information or resources on how to do that?
