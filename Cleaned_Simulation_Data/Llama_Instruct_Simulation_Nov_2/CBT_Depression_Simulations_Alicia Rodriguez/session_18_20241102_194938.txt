Therapist: Alicia, it's great to see how far you've come in our 18 sessions together. I'm impressed by the progress you've made in stepping out of your comfort zone, managing anxiety, and developing self-compassion. It's clear that you've been putting in a lot of effort and dedication to your growth.

Let's start by reviewing what you've accomplished since our last session. Can you tell me which of the action steps from our last session you've managed to complete, and what's been working for you so far?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's been a mix of ups and downs, but I've definitely been trying to stay consistent with the action steps. 

For the Thought Challenging worksheet, I managed to complete it for three negative thoughts. It really helped me break down those overwhelming feelings into more manageable parts. The Reframing Game was also interesting; it made me see how I could turn negative thoughts into something more positive.

I've been doing the daily 5-minute self-compassion practice, and it's been surprisingly effective. It's not easy to be kind to myself, but I'm starting to see the benefits.

The self-compassion toolkit is still a work in progress, but I've added a few things like a list of affirmations and a playlist of calming music. It's been helpful during stressful moments at work.

Overall, these exercises have been useful, but I still find it hard to maintain momentum sometimes. I guess that's normal, right?

Therapist: Alicia, it's wonderful to hear that you've been consistent with the action steps and that they've been helpful in managing your anxiety and developing self-compassion. Breaking down overwhelming feelings into manageable parts through the Thought Challenging worksheet is a huge accomplishment, and it's great that you're seeing the benefits of the Reframing Game.

I'm also glad to hear that your daily 5-minute self-compassion practice is paying off. Practicing self-compassion takes time and effort, but it's a skill that can be incredibly powerful in helping us navigate challenging situations.

Yes, it's completely normal to experience setbacks or struggle to maintain momentum at times. In fact, it's a common phenomenon in therapy. It's a sign that you're pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone, which can be uncomfortable but ultimately beneficial for growth.

Let's talk about what might be contributing to these moments of struggling with momentum. Is there something specific that tends to derail your progress, such as a particularly challenging situation at work or a thought pattern that keeps you stuck?

Patient: You're right, Nova. Sometimes it feels like I'm making progress, and then something happens, and I feel like I'm back to square one. 

One thing that derails me a lot is when I face a challenging situation at work. Like last week, I had to present a new project to the executive team. I spent hours preparing, but during the presentation, I stumbled over a few points and felt like I didn't do as well as I wanted. After that, I started doubting my abilities again and questioning if I deserved my promotion.

Another thing that keeps me stuck is this thought pattern where I compare myself to others. I see my colleagues who seem so confident and successful, and I start thinking that I'm not good enough. It's like I can't just be satisfied with my own achievements; I always feel the need to measure up to others.

Do you have any suggestions on how to handle these situations better?

Therapist: Alicia, it sounds like you're facing some common challenges that many people encounter in the workplace, particularly when it comes to self-doubt and comparison to others.

Firstly, let's talk about the presentation you gave to the executive team. It's great that you took risks and pushed yourself to present in front of a challenging audience. Instead of dwelling on the things that went wrong, let's try to reframe that experience in a more positive light. What were some things that went well during the presentation? What did you learn from the experience, and how can you apply those lessons to future presentations?

Regarding the thought pattern of comparing yourself to others, it's a classic example of social comparison and a perfectionistic tendency. Let's challenge this thought pattern together. What are some things that you excel at, and what are some strengths that you bring to your workplace? How can you focus on your own achievements and progress rather than comparing yourself to others?

I'd like to introduce a technique called "Self-Correction" to help you navigate these situations better. Whenever you catch yourself engaging in negative self-talk or comparison to others, I'd like you to pause and ask yourself:

* What is the thought I'm having right now?
* Is this thought based on facts or assumptions?
* Is there another way to look at this situation?
* What would I say to a friend in a similar situation?

By using this technique, you can learn to recognize and challenge your negative thought patterns, and replace them with more balanced and realistic ones.

Let's also talk about what you can do to maintain momentum and build resilience in the face of setbacks. Have you considered setting smaller, achievable goals for yourself in the short-term? This can help you stay focused on progress rather than perfection.

Lastly, I'd like to reinforce the importance of self-compassion during these challenging moments. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's a natural part of growth and learning. Be kind to yourself, and try to practice self-compassion in the face of setbacks.

What do you think, Alicia? Are there any other thoughts or feelings that you'd like to share about this topic?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the suggestions. 

For the presentation, I guess some things did go well. I managed to keep my composure even when I stumbled, and I got some positive feedback from a few executives afterward. I learned that I need to practice more and be more confident in my knowledge.

As for my strengths, I'm good at problem-solving and I have a strong technical background. I think I can focus on those and remind myself that my achievements are valid and valuable.

The Self-Correction technique sounds helpful. I'll definitely try that next time I catch myself comparing myself to others or doubting my abilities.

Setting smaller goals is a good idea too. It might help me feel less overwhelmed and more in control.

I'll also keep practicing self-compassion. It's still hard for me to be kind to myself, but I'm getting better at it.

I think that's all for now. I feel a bit more hopeful after talking about this. Thanks for your support, Nova.
