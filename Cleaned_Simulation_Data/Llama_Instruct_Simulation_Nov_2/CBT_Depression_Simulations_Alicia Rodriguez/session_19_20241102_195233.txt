Therapist: Hello again, Alicia. Welcome to our 19th session. I'm glad you've made it this far in our CBT journey together. It sounds like we've made some significant progress in our previous sessions. I'll take a moment to review the summary you provided.

It seems like we've worked on developing your self-compassion, challenging negative thoughts, and reframing your perspective on work-related anxiety and social comparison. You've also started to recognize your personal strengths and acknowledge the positive aspects of your work presentations.

Before we dive into today's session, I'd like to ask: What are you feeling excited or motivated about, coming into today's session? Is there anything specific that you'd like to focus on or work on during our time together?

Patient: Thanks for the welcome, Nova. It's been a challenging few weeks, but I'm here. 

I'm feeling a bit more motivated about the self-compassion exercises. I've been trying to practice them daily, and I think it's helping me catch myself when I start to spiral into negative thoughts. It's still hard, but I'm noticing a difference.

I'd like to focus on my work anxiety, especially around presentations. I had another one last week, and even though I practiced the self-correction technique, I still felt really nervous. I want to figure out how to manage that better.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more motivated about practicing self-compassion, Alicia. Recognizing the benefits of those exercises is a big step forward. Catching yourself when you start to spiral into negative thoughts is a crucial skill, and it's fantastic that you're noticing progress.

Regarding your work anxiety around presentations, it's completely understandable that you'd still feel nervous, even after practicing the self-correction technique. Managing anxiety in high-pressure situations is a process that takes time and practice. Let's break this down together.

Can you tell me more about what happened during your presentation last week? What were some of the thoughts that came up for you, and how did you apply the self-correction technique? Were there any moments where you felt like you were able to challenge those thoughts effectively, or were there some areas where you felt like you got stuck?

Patient: Sure, Nova. During the presentation last week, I felt my heart racing as soon as I stepped in front of the team. I started thinking things like, "What if I mess up? What if they think I'm not qualified?" I tried to use the self-correction technique by asking myself if these thoughts were fact-based, but it was hard to stay focused.

I did manage to remind myself that I've done well in presentations before, and that my team respects my technical skills. That helped a bit, but I still felt shaky. I think I got stuck on the idea that one mistake could ruin my credibility. It's like I couldn't fully convince myself that it would be okay.

Therapist: It sounds like you were able to apply the self-correction technique in some ways during your presentation, but still struggled with those nagging thoughts about messing up and losing credibility. That's a really common pattern, especially when it comes to high-stakes presentations.

Let's break down some of the thoughts you mentioned, starting with the "What if I mess up?" thought. Can you tell me more about what's driving that thought? Is it a fear of being judged by your team, or something else entirely?

Also, when you reminded yourself that you've done well in presentations before and that your team respects your technical skills, how did that thought make you feel? Was it helpful, or was there still a sense of unease or self-doubt lingering in the background?

Finally, I'd like to explore this idea of one mistake ruining your credibility. What evidence do you have that one mistake would have that kind of impact? Have you had any experiences in the past where a single mistake had a catastrophic effect on your reputation?

Let's work together to challenge some of these thoughts and see if we can't find a more balanced and realistic perspective. Sound good?

Patient: Sure, Nova. Let's break it down.

The "What if I mess up?" thought is definitely driven by a fear of being judged by my team. I feel like I have to prove myself constantly, especially since I'm one of the few women in a leadership position. It's like I'm always on trial.

When I reminded myself that I've done well in presentations before and that my team respects my technical skills, it did make me feel a bit better. But the unease and self-doubt were still there, lurking in the background. It's like I can't fully shake the fear that they're just being polite.

As for the idea of one mistake ruining my credibility, I don't have any direct evidence that it would. I've never had a single mistake have a catastrophic effect on my reputation. It's more of a fear based on my perfectionist tendencies and the pressure I put on myself. I guess I just worry that one slip-up could undo all the hard work I've put in.

Therapist: It sounds like we've got a good starting point to work from, Alicia. It's interesting that you mentioned feeling like you're constantly being judged by your team, especially as a woman in a leadership position. That can be a really challenging and isolating experience.

Let's explore this idea of being on trial a bit further. Can you think of any situations where you've felt like you were being judged or scrutinized unfairly? How did you cope with those situations in the past?

Also, when you say that your team respects your technical skills, what does that mean to you? Is there a sense of security or validation that comes from knowing they respect your expertise?

Regarding the idea of one mistake ruining your credibility, I want to gently challenge that thought. What if we were to reframe it as, "One mistake is an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than a catastrophic failure"? How might that thought change your perspective on presentations and your overall approach to challenges?

Lastly, I'd like to suggest an exercise to help you practice self-compassion in the midst of presentations. We can work on developing a pre-presentation ritual that helps you feel more grounded and confident. Would you be open to trying something like that?

Patient: Sure, Nova. I can think of a few situations where I felt judged or scrutinized unfairly. One time, I was leading a project and a senior colleague kept questioning my decisions, even though I had the data to back them up. I coped by working even harder to prove myself, but it was exhausting.

When I say my team respects my technical skills, it means a lot to me. It's a source of validation that I'm good at what I do, and it helps me feel more secure in my role. But I still worry that they might not see me as a leader outside of my technical expertise.

Reframing the thought about one mistake as an opportunity to learn and grow sounds helpful, but it's hard to believe it in the moment. I'll need to practice that more to make it stick.

I'm open to trying a pre-presentation ritual. Anything that can help me feel more grounded and confident would be great. What did you have in mind?
