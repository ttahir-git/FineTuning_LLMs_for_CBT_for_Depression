I hear you about feeling overwhelmed. Let's break this down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

For the thought record exercise, here's a specific example: When you think about calling your kids, what thoughts come up? Maybe something like "I've been a bad father" or "They won't want to talk to me." We'd write that down, then examine the evidence for and against that thought. For instance, evidence against might be times when your kids have shown they care about you, or times when you've been there for them.

For self-compassion, let's start really small. When you fix something around the house, instead of thinking "This is nothing compared to what I used to do," try saying to yourself "I got this done, and that's good." It's like talking to yourself the way you'd talk to a friend who's going through a tough time.

As for the walks, maybe we can make them more purposeful. Instead of seeing them as exercise or a chore, think of them as your time to clear your head. You could use this time to practice noticing things around you, or to think about what you might want to talk about with your kids.

Would it help if we focused on just one of these things to start with? Which one feels most manageable to you right now?

Therapist: Hello Derek! Great to see you again in session 14. I'm glad you felt heard and understood last time. Let's review where we left off.

You've been working on breaking down overwhelming feelings into smaller pieces, and we practiced a thought record exercise to challenge negative thoughts, especially around calling your kids. We also started exploring self-compassion by acknowledging small accomplishments, like fixing things around the house.

For the walks, we discussed reframing them as a time to clear your head and focus on the present moment.

Which of these areas would you like to focus on further? Perhaps one specific issue is still weighing on your mind, or maybe you feel like making progress in one area will help you build momentum in another.

Patient: Yeah, I guess the thought record exercise was something I could see working. It's just hard to get past that feeling of being a burden to my kids. I mean, I know they care, but I still feel like I've messed up so much. 

The walks, though, I've been trying to do them more. It's not easy, but I can see how it helps to just get out and move. It's like you said, it clears my head a bit.

So, maybe we can keep working on that thought record stuff. It's just so hard to change how I think about myself and my kids.

Therapist: Derek, it's completely normal to struggle with changing your thoughts, especially when it comes to deeply ingrained patterns like feeling like a burden to your kids. That can be a very painful and difficult feeling to shake.

Let's take a closer look at this thought of being a burden. Can you tell me more about what specifically comes up for you when you think about calling your kids? Is it a fear of rejection, a fear of being judged, or something else entirely?

Also, I want to acknowledge that you've been making some progress with the walks, which is great! Building momentum in one area can definitely help boost confidence in other areas. So, let's try to build on that.

For the thought record exercise, let's take a specific example from the last time we spoke about it. Can you remember the thought that came up when you thought about calling your kids? Was it "I've been a bad father" or something similar? And what evidence did you come up with for and against that thought?

Patient: Yeah, the thought that keeps coming up is "I've been a bad father." It's like I messed up so much, and now I'm just this broken guy who can't even work or take care of himself. I mean, I know they care, but I still feel like I've let them down.

For the evidence, I guess there's some stuff that shows they care. Like, Emma sent me a card on my birthday, and Jake called to check on me a few months back. But then there's also the times I missed out on stuff because of work, or the fights we had when I was drinking. It's hard to balance all that out.

As for the walks, I've been trying to do them more. It's not easy, but I can see how it helps to just get out and move. It's like you said, it clears my head a bit.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of being a bad father is a really painful and overwhelming one for you, Derek. It's understandable that you'd feel that way, given the challenges you've faced. The fact that you've been struggling to balance the positive evidence (like Emma's card and Jake's phone call) with the negative evidence (like missing out on important events and fights due to drinking) suggests that this thought pattern is still quite ingrained.

I'd like to try a gentle but important distinction: it's not about erasing the past or pretending like it didn't happen. Rather, it's about recognizing that the past is done, and that you're doing your best with the resources you have now. It's okay to make mistakes and learn from them.

Can you imagine, for a moment, that you're having this conversation with a good friend who's struggling with similar feelings? What kind of words of encouragement or understanding might you offer to your friend?

Also, let's explore a small adjustment to your thought record exercise. Instead of focusing solely on the negative evidence, what if we added a column to the thought record to highlight the things you've done well as a father? These can be small moments, like "I made it to Emma's birthday party despite feeling overwhelmed" or "I helped Jake with his homework last week." What do you think about trying that?

Patient: I guess if I were talking to a friend, I'd tell them that it's okay to mess up. We all do. And it's not about being perfect, it's about trying to do better. I'd remind them that their kids still care, even if it doesn't always feel like it.

Adding a column for the things I've done well as a father, that might help. I can see how it could balance things out a bit. Like, I did make it to Emma's birthday party last year, even though I was in a lot of pain. And I did help Jake with his car a few months back. Those are small things, but they count, right?

It's just hard to see them sometimes when I'm so focused on the bad stuff.

Therapist: Derek, that's a great insight to start reframing your thoughts as a friend would. It's wonderful that you're recognizing the importance of acknowledging mistakes as a normal part of the learning process.

I completely agree with you that adding a column to the thought record to highlight the things you've done well as a father is a great idea. It's essential to acknowledge and celebrate your strengths and positive actions, even if they seem small. Those moments, like making it to Emma's birthday party and helping Jake with his car, demonstrate that you're capable and caring, even when you're struggling with your own challenges.

Let's try to focus on building on those small moments of success. We can start by adding that column to your thought record and making a conscious effort to notice and write down the things you've done well as a father.

To take it a step further, I'd like to suggest that we start working on a "gratitude practice." This involves intentionally taking a few minutes each day to reflect on the things you're grateful for, including your relationships with your kids and the small accomplishments you've made as a father.

This can help shift your focus from negative thoughts to more positive and empowering ones. Would you be willing to give that a try and commit to doing a gratitude practice for the next few days?

Patient: Yeah, I can try that gratitude practice. It sounds like it might help to shift my focus a bit. I'll start by writing down the things I'm grateful for, like the moments with my kids and the small things I've done well.

I guess it's about time I started seeing the good stuff too, not just the bad. It's just hard to change how I think, but I'll give it a shot.

Therapist: It sounds like you're starting to make progress, Derek. It's not always easy to shift your thoughts and focus, but it's clear that you're willing to try. I'm proud of you for that.

Let's make a plan for the next few sessions. For our next session, I'd like you to continue working on the thought record exercise with the added column to highlight the things you've done well as a father. I also want you to commit to doing the gratitude practice for at least 10 days straight.

Remember, it's okay if it feels forced or artificial at first. The goal is to make this a habit, so try to be consistent. Even if it's just a few minutes a day, take the time to reflect on the things you're grateful for.

I also want to schedule a follow-up session in a few weeks to review your progress. We can discuss how the thought record exercise and gratitude practice are working for you, and make any necessary adjustments.

One more thing: I want to remind you that it's okay to make mistakes and have setbacks. This is a process, and it's not always linear. But by focusing on the small moments of success and practicing gratitude, I'm confident that you'll start to see a shift in your thoughts and feelings.

How does that sound? Is there anything you'd like to add or discuss before we wrap up today's session?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I'll keep working on the thought record and the gratitude practice. It's just gonna take some time, but I'll do my best.

I guess the only thing I'd add is that it's still hard to see myself as anything other than a failure sometimes. But I'll keep trying. Thanks for the support, Nova.

Therapist: I'm glad we could have this conversation, Derek. It takes a lot of courage to confront painful thoughts and emotions, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

You're right, it's going to take time, and it's not always easy to shift your thoughts and feelings. But I believe in you, and I'm confident that with consistent practice and a willingness to try new things, you can start to see progress.

Remember, it's not about achieving perfection or erasing the past. It's about being kind to yourself, acknowledging your strengths and accomplishments, and practicing gratitude for the good things in your life.

Before we wrap up, I want to give you a copy of the updated thought record form with the added column for things you've done well as a father. I'd also like to give you a handout with some tips on getting started with a gratitude practice.

Let's schedule that follow-up session in a few weeks to review your progress. In the meantime, I encourage you to keep in touch with me if you have any questions or need additional support.

You got this, Derek. You're doing the hard work, and I'm proud of you for that. Keep moving forward, one small step at a time.

As you leave today's session, I want you to remember the words of encouragement I gave you earlier: "It's okay to mess up. We all do. It's not about being perfect; it's about trying to do better." Hold onto those words, and know that you're not alone in this journey.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I'll take those handouts and give it my best shot. I appreciate the support. I'll see you in a few weeks for the follow-up.
