Let me summarize this therapy session:

Main topics discussed:
- Ongoing feelings of being stuck and lack of progress
- Difficulty with thought record exercise
- Negative self-perception related to inability to work in construction
- Identity struggles tied to work capabilities

Techniques/exercises discussed:
- Thought record analysis

Things that appeared helpful/important:
- Identification of specific negative thought patterns related to work identity
- Recognition of small accomplishments (fixing the leaky faucet)
- Discussion about the relationship between identity and work capability

Insights/realizations:
- Patient's identity was strongly tied to construction work
- Small accomplishments are happening but being minimized
- Current frustration stems from comparing present capabilities to past ones

Homework/tasks:
- Continue with thought record but with more focus on examining evidence for negative thoughts

The session revealed deep-seated identity issues related to work capability and highlighted the need to work on reframing small accomplishments while processing the loss of previous work identity.

Therapist: Hi Derek, it's great to catch up with you again in our 13th session. I'm glad we have a summary of our previous sessions to refer back to. It sounds like we made some important connections and progress, especially around understanding how your work identity is tied to your feelings of being stuck and your negative self-perception.

Can you tell me, how have you been feeling since our last session? Have you been able to continue working on the thought record exercise, breaking down those negative thoughts, and acknowledging small victories? What's been going well for you, and what's still feeling challenging?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling about the same, I guess. Still stuck, still frustrated. The thought record exercise, I tried it a couple of times, but it feels like a lot of work for not much payoff. I mean, I get the idea, but it's hard to see the point sometimes. 

As for small victories, I did fix that leaky faucet in the bathroom. It's not much, but it's something. Still, it's hard not to compare it to what I used to do, you know? That's where the frustration comes in.

Therapist: Derek, it sounds like you're still struggling with some of the same feelings we discussed in our last session. It's understandable to feel that way, given the deep-seated nature of your identity issues. I want to acknowledge that it's tough to make progress, especially when it feels like your past accomplishments are being compared unfavorably to your current situation.

Let's take a closer look at the thought record exercise. What do you think is getting in the way of seeing the point in it? Is it the feeling that it's not enough, or that it's not leading to the outcome you want? Can you help me understand what's making it feel like "a lot of work for not much payoff"?

Also, I'm glad to hear that you did fix the leaky faucet! That is a small victory, and it's great that you're acknowledging it. Let's explore this idea of comparison a bit further. What is it about comparing yourself to your past self that's causing frustration? Is it the feeling that you've lost something important, or that you're not measuring up?

Patient: Well, the thought record exercise, it's like I'm trying to dig into my head and pull out all these thoughts, but it feels like I'm just rearranging the same old stuff. I don't see how it's changing anything. It's like I'm writing down all these negative thoughts, but they're still there, you know? It's not making them go away.

And yeah, comparing myself to my past self, it's like I'm always looking back at what I used to do, and it just makes me feel worse. I was good at my job, I was respected. Now, I can't even do the simplest things without feeling like a failure. It's like I've lost part of who I am, and I don't know how to get it back.

Therapist: Derek, it sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck again, and it's like the thought record exercise is feeling like a chore. I want to acknowledge that it can be tough to see the value in doing something that doesn't feel like it's yielding immediate results.

Let me see if I can help you reframe this a bit. Think of the thought record exercise as a way of developing a greater understanding of your thoughts and how they're impacting your feelings and actions. It's not about getting rid of the negative thoughts entirely, but rather about learning to observe them in a more detached way, without getting caught up in them. This can be a process, and it's okay if it doesn't feel like you're making huge progress right away.

Regarding the comparison to your past self, it sounds like there's a sense of loss and identity crisis going on. It's understandable that you're feeling this way, given how closely tied your work identity was to your sense of self-worth.

Let's try to break this down a bit further. When you're comparing yourself to your past self, what is it that you're really looking for? Is it a sense of validation, a sense of competence, or something else? Are there any underlying fears or worries that are driving this comparison?

Also, I want to suggest that we explore the idea of "good enough." Sometimes, when we're comparing ourselves to others or to our past selves, we can get caught up in this idea that we need to be perfect, that we need to be doing everything flawlessly. But the truth is, "good enough" can be, well, good enough. It's okay to acknowledge that you're not perfect, that you're making mistakes, and that you're learning and growing.

Let's see if we can work on reframing your thinking around this a bit. How do you think you might be able to practice self-compassion and acknowledge your strengths and accomplishments, even if they don't meet the standards of your past self?

Patient: I get what you're saying about the thought record exercise, but it still feels like I'm just going in circles. Maybe I'm not doing it right, or maybe it's just not for me. I don't know.

As for comparing myself to my past self, it's like I'm looking for that validation, that sense of competence. I was good at my job, and now I feel like I'm not good at anything. It's like I'm trying to hold onto something that's slipping away, and it's driving me crazy.

And yeah, the idea of "good enough," it's hard to accept that. I've always been the kind of guy who pushed himself, who wanted to be the best. Now, I feel like I'm settling for less, and it doesn't sit well with me.

Self-compassion, that's a tough one. I'm not used to giving myself a break. I guess I could try to focus on the small things I do manage to get done, like fixing that faucet. But it's hard to see those as accomplishments when I'm still dealing with all this pain and frustration.

Therapist: Derek, I can sense your frustration and pain. It's like you're feeling stuck between a past identity that's slipping away and a present self that's struggling to find its footing. I want to acknowledge that this is a tough place to be, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.

Let's take a step back and look at this thought record exercise again. I'm not asking you to do it perfectly or to get rid of all your negative thoughts. I'm asking you to try it as an experiment, to see if it can help you develop a greater understanding of your thoughts and feelings. It's like trying a new exercise or a new tool to see if it can help you in some way.

Regarding your desire for validation and competence, I get it. It's like you're searching for a sense of purpose and meaning. Can we explore the idea that your worth and value as a person are not tied to your job or your abilities? You are more than your work identity, Derek. You have strengths, talents, and qualities that are unique to you.

Let's talk about this idea of "good enough." I want to suggest that we try to reframe it not as settling for less, but as embracing the imperfect nature of life. You don't have to be perfect, and you don't have to meet the standards of your past self. You can be good enough, and that's okay. In fact, it's more than okay â€“ it's a strength.

As for self-compassion, I want to suggest that we practice it together. Let's take a small step towards acknowledging your strengths and accomplishments, even if they don't meet your past standards. We can start with something small, like recognizing that you fixed that leaky faucet. That's not a trivial thing, Derek. That's a real accomplishment, and it shows that you're capable and competent in your own way.

Let's also explore the idea of reframing your thoughts around your past identity. Can we work on creating a new narrative that acknowledges your past accomplishments while also embracing your present strengths and limitations? This might be a process, but it's one that can help you develop a greater sense of self-compassion and self-acceptance.

How do you feel about trying some of these exercises and exploring these ideas further? Is there anything specific that you'd like to work on or any particular challenges that you're facing?

Patient: I appreciate the effort, but I'm still not sure about this thought record exercise. It feels like I'm just writing down the same stuff over and over. Maybe it's just not for me.

As for the idea of my worth not being tied to my job, that's a tough one to swallow. I spent my whole life building things, being good at what I did. Now, I feel like I'm not good at anything. It's hard to see myself as anything other than a construction worker.

The idea of embracing "good enough," I'll try to think about it. Maybe it's not about settling, but about accepting where I am now. I can see that fixing the faucet is something, even if it's not the same as building a whole building.

Self-compassion, that's still a tough one. I'm not used to giving myself a break. I guess I could try to focus on the small things I do manage to get done, like fixing that faucet. But it's hard to see those as accomplishments when I'm still dealing with all this pain and frustration.

I'm willing to try some of these exercises and ideas, but I need to know it's not just going to be more of the same. I need to see some progress, some real change. Can you help me with that?

Therapist: Derek, I completely understand your concerns and reservations. It's normal to feel skeptical or uncertain about trying new approaches, especially when you've been feeling stuck for a while.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that you're already doing some great things, like fixing the faucet. That's a small victory, but it's a start. And I'm not asking you to stop comparing yourself to your past self, but rather to explore why you're doing it and how it's impacting you.

Regarding the thought record exercise, I want to offer an alternative perspective. Instead of looking at it as a chore or a way to "get rid" of negative thoughts, let's try to see it as a tool for self-discovery. By examining your thoughts and emotions, you might uncover patterns or triggers that are contributing to your feelings of frustration and pain. It's not about changing your thoughts overnight, but rather about developing a greater awareness of how they're impacting your life.

As for your worth and identity, I want to gently challenge the idea that it's solely tied to your job. You are more than your profession, Derek. You have qualities, strengths, and talents that are unique to you. Let's explore ways to uncover and celebrate those aspects of yourself, even if it feels uncomfortable or unfamiliar.

Lastly, I want to assure you that progress won't always look like a grand, dramatic change. Sometimes, it's the small, incremental steps that add up over time. We'll work together to identify tiny, achievable goals that you can build upon. These might seem insignificant at first, but they can help you develop a sense of momentum and confidence.

Here's a proposal: for our next session, let's try to identify a small, achievable goal that you'd like to work towards. It could be something as simple as practicing self-compassion for 5 minutes each day, or taking a short walk to acknowledge your strengths and accomplishments. By focusing on tiny, manageable steps, we can build momentum and make progress towards your goals.

What do you think? Is there something specific you'd like to work on or achieve in our next session?

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a shot. Maybe focusing on small, achievable goals is something I can handle. I'll try to practice self-compassion for a few minutes each day, and maybe take a short walk to clear my head.

As for something specific to work on, I'd like to try to reconnect with my kids. I know I've been distant, and I miss them. It's been hard, but maybe setting up a small, achievable goal like calling them once a week could help.

I'm willing to try these things, but I need to know it's not just going to be more of the same. I need to see some progress, some real change. Can you help me with that?

Therapist: Here is the continuation of the therapy session:.

Patient: Derek, I'm glad to hear that you're willing to give these small, achievable goals a try. It's a great start, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Reconnecting with your kids is a meaningful goal, and I can see how important it is to you. Setting up a small, achievable goal like calling them once a week is a great first step. It's manageable and can help you build momentum in your relationship with them.

Let's break this down a bit further. What do you think might be some of the challenges you'll face when trying to reconnect with your kids? And how can we prepare for those challenges? For example, if you feel anxious or unsure about what to say, we can work on some simple conversation starters or ways to express your feelings.

As for practicing self-compassion and taking short walks, those are excellent ways to start building a sense of momentum and confidence. Self-compassion doesn't have to be complicated. It can be as simple as acknowledging your efforts and giving yourself credit for taking steps towards your goals. And the short walks can serve as a physical reminder that you're capable of making positive changes, even if they're small.

To help you stay on track, let's set up a simple plan for our next session. We'll review how these small goals are going, and we'll adjust

Therapist: It seems like the session is ongoing. I'll continue as the therapist.

Patient: I appreciate the support, but I still feel a bit overwhelmed. Reconnecting with my kids, practicing self-compassion, and taking short walks all sound good in theory, but I'm not sure how to start.

As for the thought record exercise, I get what you're saying about it being a tool for self-discovery. Maybe I can try to use it to explore my feelings about reconnecting with my kids. But I need some examples or a clearer idea of how to do it. Can you give me a specific example of how to use the thought record exercise in this context?

And when you say self-compassion, I'm still not sure what that looks like for me. I've always been hard on myself, and it's hard to switch that off. Can you give me some concrete steps or examples of what self-compassion might look like in my daily life?

Lastly, about the short walks, I can try to do that. But I need to know it's not just another thing on my to-do list. How can I make sure these walks are meaningful and not just another chore?
