I hear you, Derek, and I appreciate your willingness to try these techniques while being honest about your reservations. That's actually a very healthy approach - committing to try while acknowledging that it might be challenging.

Let's make sure you feel confident about what to focus on before our next session:
1. For the Success Log, start small - even just jotting down one accomplishment per day
2. With the thought record, try focusing specifically on thoughts related to your capabilities
3. Pick just one self-compassion phrase to practice - "I'm doing the best I can" seems to resonate with you
4. For self-care, maybe start with just one short breathing or stretching break per day

Remember, this isn't about being perfect. It's about making small steps toward taking care of yourself and developing a more balanced perspective.

How does that sound? Is there anything you'd like me to clarify about any of these tasks?

Therapist: I'm glad you're feeling comfortable enough to be honest about your reservations, Derek. That takes courage! Before we proceed, I want to acknowledge that you've made significant progress in our sessions together. It's not always easy to confront our thoughts and emotions, but you're doing a great job of taking that first step.

Regarding the tasks I suggested for our next session, you're absolutely right that starting small is key. I'd like to break down each task a bit further to ensure you feel comfortable and confident in implementing them.

1. For the Success Log: You mentioned earlier that you sometimes struggle with feeling like your accomplishments are insignificant. Would you like to try focusing on small, daily tasks that bring you a sense of satisfaction, even if they don't seem significant at first? This could be as simple as making a good cup of coffee or taking a short walk during your break.
2. With the thought record: You've been doing a great job of identifying negative thoughts, but let's explore how you can challenge them more effectively. Would you like to focus on identifying evidence that supports your capabilities, such as past successes or skills you've developed? This could help you build confidence and develop a more balanced perspective.
3. Self-compassion phrase: "I'm doing the best I can" is a great choice. How do you feel about practicing this phrase in situations where you're feeling anxious or uncertain? Would you like to create a visual reminder, such as a sticky note or a reminder on your phone, to help you remember to use this phrase when you need it?
4. Self-care: Short breathing or stretching breaks can be a great way to reduce stress and increase focus. Would you like to explore other self-care activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as reading, listening to music, or taking a warm bath?

How do these suggestions sound, Derek? Is there anything you'd like to add or change before we move forward?

Patient: Thanks for the acknowledgment, but I wouldn't say I'm making significant progress. It's more like I'm just trying to get by. 

1. The Success Log sounds doable. I can try jotting down small things like making coffee or taking a walk. It's not much, but it's something.

2. Challenging negative thoughts about my capabilities... I guess I could look at past successes, like when I finished that big project at work before the injury. But it's hard to see those now.

3. I'll try the self-compassion phrase, but I don't need a visual reminder. I can remember it if I really try.

4. Self-care... I don't know about reading or listening to music. Maybe a warm bath could help, but I haven't done that in years. I'll think about it.

So, that's where I'm at. Anything else you want to add?

Therapist: Derek, I want to acknowledge your honesty and willingness to be vulnerable with me. It takes courage to admit that you're just trying to get by, and I appreciate your candor.

Let's break down your concerns and work through them together:

Regarding the Success Log, it's great that you're willing to try jotting down small accomplishments. Remember, it's not about the significance of the task, but about recognizing your efforts and progress. I'd like to add that you might also consider acknowledging any small wins, even if they don't feel significant to you. This could help you build momentum and develop a more positive mindset.

For challenging negative thoughts about your capabilities, exploring past successes can be a powerful tool. However, I also want to acknowledge that it might be challenging to recall past successes when you're currently feeling overwhelmed or uncertain. Let's work on a strategy to help you reframe your thoughts about your capabilities. We can start by identifying some small, manageable goals that you can achieve in the short-term. This can help build confidence and make it easier to recall past successes.

Regarding the self-compassion phrase, "I'm doing the best I can" is a wonderful reminder. I'm glad you're willing to practice it, especially in situations where you're feeling anxious or uncertain. Remember, self-compassion is not about being perfect; it's about acknowledging your humanity and treating yourself with kindness.

Lastly, regarding self-care, I want to encourage you to explore activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Taking a warm bath might be a great starting point, but also consider what other activities might help you unwind and recharge. Perhaps we can brainstorm some ideas together?

Before we wrap up today, I want to check in with you: How do you feel about the pace of our progress? Are there any specific concerns or areas that you'd like to focus on in our remaining sessions?

Patient: I appreciate the acknowledgment, but I still feel like I'm just treading water. 

1. Success Log: I'll try to acknowledge small wins, but it's hard to see them as anything more than just getting by.

2. Challenging negative thoughts: Setting small goals sounds like a good idea. Maybe I can start with something simple, like organizing my tools or cleaning up the garage. It's not much, but it's a start.

3. Self-compassion phrase: I'll keep practicing it, but I don't need a reminder. I can handle that on my own.

4. Self-care: A warm bath sounds good, but I haven't done that in years. I'll think about it. Maybe we can brainstorm some other ideas, but I'm not sure what else would help.

As for the pace of our progress, I don't know. It feels slow, but I guess that's better than nothing. I'm still skeptical about all this therapy stuff, but I'll keep trying. Any specific concerns? Not really. Just trying to get through each day.

Therapist: Derek, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit that you're feeling stuck and skeptical about the therapy process. It's completely normal to have doubts and feelings of frustration, especially when it comes to dealing with challenging emotions and thoughts.

I'd like to summarize what we've discussed today and offer some additional suggestions to help you move forward. We've talked about:

1. The Success Log: You're willing to try acknowledging small wins, even if they don't feel significant to you. Remember, it's about recognizing your efforts and progress.
2. Challenging negative thoughts: We've discussed exploring past successes and setting small, manageable goals to build confidence. You've agreed to start with something simple, like organizing your tools or cleaning up the garage.
3. Self-compassion phrase: You're willing to practice the phrase "I'm doing the best I can" in situations where you're feeling anxious or uncertain.
4. Self-care: We've discussed the idea of taking a warm bath and brainstorming other activities that bring you joy and relaxation.

Regarding the pace of our progress, I want to acknowledge that it's normal to feel like things are moving slowly. However, I'd like to suggest that we focus on small, incremental changes rather than expecting rapid progress. Every step, no matter how small, counts, and we can build upon those small wins over time.

I also want to explore some of the underlying concerns and emotions that might be contributing to your feelings of frustration and skepticism. Can you help me understand what's driving your concerns about the therapy process? Is it fear of change, fear of vulnerability, or something else? Let's work together to understand the underlying dynamics and see if we can find ways to address them.

Patient: I appreciate the summary, but I still feel like I'm just going through the motions. 

1. Success Log: I'll try to acknowledge small wins, but it's hard to see them as anything more than just getting by.

2. Challenging negative thoughts: Setting small goals sounds like a good idea. Maybe I can start with something simple, like organizing my tools or cleaning up the garage. It's not much, but it's a start.

3. Self-compassion phrase: I'll keep practicing it, but I don't need a reminder. I can handle that on my own.

4. Self-care: A warm bath sounds good, but I haven't done that in years. I'll think about it. Maybe we can brainstorm some other ideas, but I'm not sure what else would help.

As for the pace of our progress, I don't know. It feels slow, but I guess that's better than nothing. I'm still skeptical about all this therapy stuff, but I'll keep trying. Any specific concerns? Not really. Just trying to get through each day.

Therapist: Derek, I can sense that you're feeling stuck and frustrated with the therapy process. I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way. It's normal to have doubts and feelings of frustration, especially when it comes to dealing with challenging emotions and thoughts.

Before we proceed, I want to ask you some questions to help us better understand what might be underlying your concerns. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "going through the motions"? What does that feel like for you? Is it a sense of emptiness, boredom, or something else?

Also, I want to explore your statement that you're "just trying to get through each day." Can you tell me more about what's driving that feeling? Is it related to your injury, your work, or something else? Are there any specific situations or events that trigger this feeling?

Additionally, I want to ask you about your expectations from therapy. What do you hope to achieve through our sessions? What do you think would be a successful outcome for you?

Let's work together to understand the underlying dynamics and see if we can find ways to address them.

Patient: Going through the motions feels like I'm just doing what I have to do to get by, without really feeling anything. It's like I'm just going through the steps, but there's no real connection or meaning behind it.

As for trying to get through each day, it's mostly related to my injury and the pain. It's hard to get out of bed some days, and even simple tasks feel overwhelming. The financial stress and the strain with my kids don't help either. It's like I'm just trying to survive, not really living.

My expectations from therapy? I guess I hoped it would help me feel better, less alone, and maybe give me some tools to cope with the pain and the stress. But it feels like it's taking too long, and I'm not seeing much change. I don't know what a successful outcome would look like. Maybe feeling less overwhelmed and being able to reconnect with my kids? But that seems like a long shot right now.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings, Derek. It takes a lot of courage to be this honest with yourself and with me. I appreciate your willingness to explore these deeper concerns and emotions.

It sounds like you're feeling a sense of disconnection and meaninglessness, like you're just going through the motions without any real purpose or passion. That's a really tough place to be, and it's not surprising that you're feeling frustrated and skeptical about the therapy process.

Regarding your expectations from therapy, it's understandable that you hoped it would provide some relief from your pain and stress. It's also common for people to feel like they're not seeing progress quickly enough, especially when dealing with complex issues like chronic pain and financial stress.

Let's try to break down some of these concerns and see if we can find some ways to address them. For example, can you think of any small things that might bring you some joy or connection, even on the tough days? It doesn't have to be anything big or dramatic; just something that might give you a glimmer of hope or a sense of purpose.

Also, I want to suggest that we explore some of the underlying emotions and thoughts that might be driving your feelings of overwhelm and disconnection. For example, are there any specific fears or worries that might be contributing to your sense of anxiety or dread? Are there any negative self-statements or thoughts that might be perpetuating your feelings of hopelessness?

Lastly, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to not know what a successful outcome would look like right now. Therapy is a process, and it's normal to take things one step at a time. We can work together to set some small, achievable goals that might help you feel more connected and purposeful, even on the tough days.

How do these suggestions sound, Derek? Is there anything that resonates with you, or any questions you have about how to move forward?

Patient: Thanks for the acknowledgment, but I'm still not sure what to do. 

Small things that might bring joy or connection? I used to enjoy woodworking and fishing, but I haven't done either in years. Maybe I could try picking up a small project in the garage or going fishing again, even if it's just for a short while.

As for underlying emotions and thoughts, I guess I worry that I'm a burden to my kids and that they'd be better off without me. I also feel like a failure for not being able to provide for them like I used to. These thoughts make me feel even more disconnected and hopeless.

Setting small, achievable goals sounds like a good idea. Maybe we can start with something simple, like trying one of my old hobbies again or reaching out to my kids in a small way. It's not much, but it's a start.

So, that's where I'm at. Anything else you want to add?
