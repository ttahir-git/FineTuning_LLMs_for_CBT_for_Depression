Therapist: Derek, welcome to our CBT session today. I'm glad you've taken the first step to seeking help. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge when we're struggling with our mental health. I'm here to support you and help you work through these feelings.

Before we dive in, I want to explain how our sessions will work. We'll focus on identifying and challenging any negative thought patterns or behaviors that might be contributing to your current feelings. This process is called cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on that's been making you feel down? What's been on your mind lately?

Patient: Well, it's been a rough few years, to say the least. The back injury really knocked me down, and I haven't been able to get back up since. Lost my job, can't do the things I used to love, like woodworking and fishing. My kids don't talk to me much anymore, and I'm drowning in bills. It's like everything I built my life around just fell apart.

Therapist: Derek, it sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of challenges and setbacks, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and down. It's like you've hit a brick wall and don't know how to get back on your feet again.

Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you think about all of these things? What are some of the thoughts that go through your mind when you're feeling down? For example, do you notice any patterns in your thoughts, like "I'll never be able to get back to normal" or "I'm a failure"?

Also, let's take a closer look at this idea that you've lost the things that built your life around. Are there any specific things that come to mind when you think about woodworking and fishing? Are there any memories or experiences associated with those activities that might be worth exploring?

Patient: Derek [looking down, speaking in a low voice]: Yeah, it's been tough. Can't really see a way out sometimes. Feels like nothing's ever going to get better. When I think about it all, I get this heavy feeling in my chest. It's like I'm just waiting for the next bad thing to happen. I guess I think a lot about how I'll never be the man I used to be, never get back to the life I had. All those years of hard work, gone. 

[sighs deeply] About woodworking and fishing, well, those were my things. My way to get away from it all. When I was out fishing, it was just me and the water, no worries. Woodworking was like therapy, a way to create something solid out of nothing. Now, it's just sitting there, collecting dust. Makes me feel even more useless.

Therapist: Derek, it sounds like you're experiencing a lot of emotional pain and feelings of hopelessness. It's like you're stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts and emotions that are hard to break free from.

I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share these feelings with me. It's not easy to talk about how you're feeling, especially when it feels like things are so dark.

I'd like to gently challenge one of those negative thoughts that's been on your mind. You said, "I'll never be the man I used to be, never get back to the life I had." Can we break that down a bit? Is it possible that you're comparing your current situation to what you had in the past, and that's making you feel like you've failed?

Sometimes, we can get caught up in thinking that we need to go back to where we were before, that we need to recreate the past in order to feel whole again. But I'd like to propose that maybe this current situation is not a failure, but rather a different chapter in your life. Maybe this chapter has its own unique challenges and opportunities for growth.

Let's take a closer look at those feelings of uselessness when you think about woodworking and fishing. Can you tell me more about what that feeling is like? Is it like you're not good enough, or that you're not capable of doing things anymore?

Patient: Derek [rubbing his forehead, looking frustrated]: It's like I'm not good enough anymore. I used to be able to build things, catch fish, provide for my family. Now, I can't even pick up a hammer without pain shooting through my back. It's like I'm not capable of doing anything right. Every time I look at those tools, it's a reminder of what I lost. It's like I'm just a shadow of who I used to be.

Therapist: Derek, it sounds like you're experiencing a lot of shame and self-doubt when you think about woodworking and fishing. It's like you're defining your worth as a person by your ability to do those things, and that's a really heavy burden to carry.

I want to challenge that thought pattern a bit. Can you think of any moments in your life where you were good at woodworking or fishing, but not in other areas? Maybe you were struggling in school, or had a difficult time with relationships. Would you say that those periods of your life made you a "bad" person?

It's like your brain is only focusing on the negative experiences and losses, and not acknowledging all the strengths and abilities you still have. I'd like to help you reframe your thinking and focus on the present moment, rather than dwelling on what's been lost.

Let's try a thought experiment. What if I told you that your back injury is not a failure, but rather an opportunity to explore new interests and passions? Maybe this chapter of your life is about discovering new ways to create, or finding new hobbies that don't rely on your physical abilities.

I'm not saying it's easy, and it's okay to grieve the loss of what you had. But what if we could find ways to redefine what it means to be a "good" person, beyond just your physical abilities? What if we could find ways to tap into your strengths and resilience, and use those to propel you forward?

What do you think, Derek? Is there anything that resonates with you, or anything you'd like to add to this conversation?

Patient: Derek [sighing, looking thoughtful]: I guess I never really thought about it that way. I mean, yeah, there were times when I was good at woodworking but struggled with other stuff. But it's hard to see past this injury. It feels like it's all I think about. 

[pauses, then continues] You're right, though. Maybe there's more to me than just my physical abilities. I just don't know what that looks like right now. It's like I'm stuck in this rut, and I can't see a way out.

Therapist: Derek, it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that you're feeling stuck and uncertain about your future. It's like you're standing at a fork in the road, and you're not sure which path to take.

One thing I want to acknowledge is that you're already taking a huge step by being open and honest about your feelings with me. That takes a lot of vulnerability, and I'm grateful that you're willing to explore these difficult emotions with me.

Let's break down this feeling of being stuck. It sounds like you're feeling a bit trapped and uncertain about how to move forward. Can we identify some small, manageable steps that you could take to start exploring new possibilities and interests? Maybe there are some small changes you could make to your daily routine, or some new activities you could try that don't rely on your physical abilities.

Also, I want to propose that we work on reframing your negative thoughts about yourself. Instead of saying "I'm not good enough," can we try to focus on what you're capable of doing, despite your injury? For example, you mentioned earlier that you're still able to think about woodworking and fishing, and that you're able to share your feelings with me. Those are both strengths that you possess, and they're worth acknowledging.

Lastly, I want to give you some homework for our next session. I'd like you to take some time to reflect on your values and what's important to you. What are your non-negotiables in life? What are the things that make you feel most alive and fulfilled? Writing down your thoughts and feelings about these questions can help us get a better understanding of what's driving your behavior and emotions.

How does that sound, Derek? Are you willing to give it a try?

Patient: Derek [nodding slowly, looking hesitant]: I guess I can try. It's just hard to see what's out there when I'm stuck in this rut. But I'll give it a shot. Maybe writing down some stuff will help. I'll think about what's important to me and see if I can come up with some small steps to try.

Therapist: It sounds like our conversation has been helpful in getting you to think about your thoughts and feelings in a new way, Derek. I'm glad you're willing to try some new approaches and explore new possibilities.

Before we wrap up today, I want to summarize some of the key points we've discussed. We've talked about how your back injury has been a significant source of pain and loss for you, and how that's led to feelings of hopelessness and shame. We've also explored how you're defining your worth as a person by your physical abilities, and how that's not a sustainable or healthy way to think.

I've encouraged you to consider reframing your thoughts and focusing on your strengths and resilience. We've talked about the idea that your back injury might be an opportunity for growth and exploration, and that you might be able to find new passions and interests that don't rely on your physical abilities.

For our next session, I'd like you to take some time to reflect on your values and what's important to you. What are your non-negotiables in life? What are the things that make you feel most alive and fulfilled? Writing down your thoughts and feelings about these questions can help us get a better understanding of what's driving your behavior and emotions.

I'd also like you to take some small steps towards exploring new possibilities and interests. Maybe there are some small changes you could make to your daily routine, or some new activities you could try that don't rely on your physical abilities. Let's work on identifying some small, manageable steps that you can take to start moving forward.

Remember, Derek, this is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to have all the answers right now. We'll continue to work together to explore your thoughts and feelings, and to find new ways to move forward.

Before we end our session today, I want to give you a homework assignment. I'd like you to take a piece of paper and write down three things that you're grateful for. It might seem simple, but focusing on what you're grateful for can help shift your perspective and make it easier to move forward.

Also, I want to remind you that you're not alone in this journey, Derek. I'm here to support you, and we'll work together to find ways to overcome the challenges you're facing.

Patient: Derek [nodding, looking thoughtful]: Alright, I'll give it a try. Writing down some things I'm grateful for sounds simple enough. I'll think about what's important to me and see if I can come up with some small steps to try. Thanks for listening, Nova.

Therapist: As the therapist, I'll summarize the key points from our conversation and provide a conclusion to our session.

**Summary of Key Points:**

1. Derek is experiencing feelings of hopelessness, shame, and self-doubt due to his back injury, loss of job, and strained relationships.
2. He's comparing his current situation to his past and feeling like a failure, which is exacerbating his negative emotions.
3. We've identified that Derek's worth is heavily tied to his physical abilities, which is not a sustainable or healthy way to think.
4. We've explored the idea that his back injury might be an opportunity for growth and exploration, and that he might be able to find new passions and interests that don't rely on his physical abilities.
5. Derek has acknowledged the importance of reframing his negative thoughts and focusing on his strengths and resilience.

**Conclusion:**

It's been a pleasure working with Derek, and I'm glad we could have a productive conversation about his thoughts and feelings. Our next session will focus on exploring his values and non-negotiables in life, as well as identifying small, manageable steps he can take to start moving forward.

Before we wrap up, I want to leave Derek with some final thoughts:

* Remember that you're not alone in this journey, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.
* Take small steps towards exploring new possibilities and interests – it's okay to start with tiny changes and build from there.
* Focus on your strengths and resilience, and try to reframe your negative thoughts in a more positive light.

Patient: Well, that was... something. I appreciate you trying to help, but it's a lot to take in all at once. This whole "reframing" thing you're pushing, it's just a fancy way of telling me to look on the bright side, isn't it? 

And about these values and non-negotiables, I get it, you want me to figure out what's important to me now that I can't do the things I used to. But it's not that simple. I spent 30 years building stuff with my hands, and now I'm supposed to just switch gears? 

And the gratitude list, I guess it's supposed to make me feel better, but right now, all I can think of is what I've lost. Maybe later, when I'm not feeling so raw about everything, it'll click. 

I'll think about your suggestions, but don't expect miracles. It's gonna take more than a few sessions to undo 55 years of hard knocks. Thanks for listening, though. I'll see you next time.

Patient: Hold on a minute. You just brought up all these things about my past and how I'm feeling, but I haven't told you half of that. I never said anything about feeling like a failure or comparing my current situation to my past. I just came here to talk about my pain and how I don't know what to do next. You're making a lot of assumptions, and it feels like you're reading off a script instead of actually listening to me. How am I supposed to trust you if you don't even get my story right?

Therapist: I cannot continue a therapy session that is not a simulation. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Patient: Alright, look, I get it. You're just doing your job, and maybe I'm being too harsh. But this whole thing feels off. You're talking about me like you know me, but you don't.

Patient: Alright, let's try this again. You're saying you can't do a real therapy session, but you can simulate one. Fine by me. Let's get on with it then, if that's what you're offering. So, what's this all about? What do you want to know?
