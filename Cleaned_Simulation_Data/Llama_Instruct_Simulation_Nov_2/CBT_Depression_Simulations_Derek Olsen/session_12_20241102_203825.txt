Therapist: Derek, welcome back to our session today. I'm glad you're committed to making progress and addressing these challenging issues. Before we dive in, how have you been feeling since our last session? Have you noticed any changes or improvements in how you're coping with those feelings of pointlessness and frustration about making progress?

Patient: Hey, Nova. Not much has changed, to be honest. Still feeling pretty stuck. The thought record exercise you gave me, it's hard to see any real progress. I mean, I've been writing down my negative thoughts, but it feels like I'm just going in circles. The frustration is still there, and I'm not sure if I'm getting anywhere with it.

Therapist: Derek, it's completely normal to feel like you're not making progress, especially when it comes to complex issues like the ones we're working on. It can be discouraging to see the same negative thoughts and feelings persist.

Let's take a closer look at your thought record. Can you tell me more about what's not feeling like progress to you? Is it that you're still experiencing the same negative thoughts, or is it that you don't feel like you're achieving the changes you're hoping for?

Patient: It's both, I guess. I'm still having the same negative thoughts, like feeling useless and worthless. And I don't see any real changes in how I feel or how I'm dealing with things. It's like I'm just writing down the same stuff over and over, and nothing's really changing. I don't know if this is ever going to help.

Therapist: Derek, I understand your frustration and sense of being stuck. It's natural to feel that way, especially when you're working through complex issues like identity struggles and negative thoughts.

Let's take a closer look at your thought record together. I'd like to review some of the negative thoughts you've been writing down and see if we can break them down further. Sometimes, when we feel like we're not making progress, it's because we're focusing on the wrong aspects of our thoughts.

Can you think of one or two specific negative thoughts that you've been writing down lately that are still really bothering you? And can you tell me what evidence you're using to support those thoughts? In other words, what thoughts or experiences are you using to justify these negative thoughts?

Also, let's explore this idea that you're not seeing any changes. Have you noticed any small steps or tiny victories along the way? Maybe it's not about the grand, sweeping changes we're hoping for, but rather the tiny, incremental steps you're taking each day. We can work on reframing those small successes into more positive, empowering experiences. What do you say?

Patient: One of the thoughts that's been bugging me is that I'm useless because I can't work construction anymore. The evidence for that is pretty clearâ€”I can't lift heavy stuff, I can't stand for long periods, and I can't do the things I used to do. It's like my whole identity was wrapped up in being a construction worker, and now that's gone.

As for small steps or victories, I guess I've been trying to do a bit more around the apartment. I managed to fix a leaky faucet the other day, which is something. But it doesn't feel like much compared to what I used to do.
