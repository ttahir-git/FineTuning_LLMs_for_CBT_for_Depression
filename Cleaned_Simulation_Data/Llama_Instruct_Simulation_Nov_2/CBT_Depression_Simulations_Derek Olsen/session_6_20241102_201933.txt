Therapist: Hello Derek! Great to see you again in our 7th session. I've reviewed our previous sessions, and I'm impressed with the progress you've made so far. It's wonderful to hear that you've been practicing Positive Self-Talk, breaking down tasks into manageable pieces, and adapting activities to accommodate your physical limitations.

Before we dive into the current session, I'd like to acknowledge the insights you've gained. Recognizing the value of small moments of connection with your family and understanding the importance of self-compassion in managing frustration with physical limitations are significant breakthroughs. These realizations will likely have a positive impact on your overall well-being.

As we move forward, what specific areas would you like to focus on in this session? Are there any challenges or concerns that have arisen since our last meeting that you'd like to discuss?

Patient: Thanks for the kind words, but I wouldn't say I'm making "progress" exactly. It's more like I'm just trying to get by day to day. 

As for what I want to focus on... I guess I'm still struggling with this whole self-compassion thing. I don't really get why it's supposed to help. I mean, I know my back hurts and I can't do the things I used to, but I don't see how telling myself "it's okay" is going to change that. 

And I did try breaking down that woodworking project, but it just feels like I'm never going to finish it. I get frustrated and end up just walking away. Maybe if you could explain this self-compassion stuff a bit more, give me an example or something, that might help me understand it better.

Therapist: Derek, thank you for your honesty. It's completely normal to feel like you're just trying to get by day to day, especially when dealing with chronic pain and physical limitations. It takes a lot of courage to show up and continue to work on these challenges.

I'd be happy to help you understand self-compassion better. Self-compassion isn't about ignoring your pain or limitations, but rather about treating yourself with kindness, understanding, and acceptance when you're struggling. It's about recognizing that it's okay to not be okay, and that you're doing the best you can.

Let me give you an example. Imagine you're working on that woodworking project, and you get frustrated because you can't do the tasks you used to. Instead of beating yourself up with self-criticism, saying "you're a failure" or "you'll never finish this," try saying to yourself, "Oh, I'm really struggling with this right now. It's frustrating, and my back is hurting. That makes sense. I'm going to take a break and come back to this later when I'm feeling more capable."

Notice how that's different from just ignoring your frustration or limitations? By acknowledging your emotions and accepting your limitations, you're not giving up; you're actually giving yourself permission to rest and recharge. This can help you come back to the task with a clearer mind and a more positive attitude.

In terms of the "it's okay" phrase, it's not about waving a magic wand and making your pain disappear. It's about recognizing that you're human, and it's okay to experience pain, frustration, or disappointment. It's a way of being kind to yourself, rather than judgmental or critical.

Does this example help you see self-compassion in a new light, or is there still something that's not clicking for you?

Patient: Yeah, I get what you're saying about not beating myself up. That makes sense. I guess I just never thought about it that way before. 

But here's the thing - I did try that "take a break" approach with the woodworking. I even broke it down into smaller tasks like you suggested. But when I came back, I still couldn't do it. My back just won't let me. So it feels like I'm just delaying the inevitable frustration. 

I don't know, maybe I'm just too stubborn to accept that I can't do the things I used to. It's like I keep hoping that if I just try hard enough, I'll get back to where I was. But that's not happening. 

Maybe you could give me another example, something that's not related to my back or woodworking. Something that might help me see this self-compassion thing in a different way.

Therapist: Derek, I completely understand your concerns and frustrations. It's like you're feeling stuck between trying to hold on to what you used to be able to do and accepting your current limitations.

Let me give you an example that might help you see self-compassion in a different light. Imagine you're having a tough day, and you're feeling anxious or overwhelmed. Instead of beating yourself up with self-criticism, try saying to yourself, "Ah, I'm really feeling anxious right now. That's a tough feeling. I'm going to take a few deep breaths and try to relax. It's okay to not be perfect, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes."

Notice how this approach acknowledges your emotions and gives yourself permission to feel them, rather than trying to push them away or judge yourself for feeling that way? It's like you're saying, "I've got this, and it's okay if I don't have it all together right now."

Another example might be if you're worried about not being able to spend as much time with Jake as you used to. Instead of beating yourself up about it, try saying to yourself, "I'm really missing my old ability to spend time with Jake, and that's okay. I'm doing the best I can with the energy I have right now. I'm going to find ways to connect with him that feel manageable for me, even if it's not the same as before."

Does this help you see self-compassion as more than just a way to ignore your struggles, but rather as a way to acknowledge and accept them?

Patient: Yeah, I get what you're saying about acknowledging my feelings instead of pushing them away. That makes sense. 

But here's the thing - I've tried that with Jake. I mean, I've told myself it's okay that I can't do the things I used to with him. But it still feels like I'm letting him down. Like he deserves better than what I can give right now. 

I don't know, maybe I just need to hear it from him that it's okay. But I can't bring myself to ask him that. It feels too weak, too needy. 

Maybe you could help me figure out how to talk to him about this without feeling like I'm burdening him or making him feel sorry for me.

Therapist: Derek, I'm glad we're exploring this further. It's completely understandable that you're concerned about how Jake might react to your limitations, and it's great that you're thinking about how to approach this conversation.

Let's break it down. When you're feeling like you're letting Jake down, try to acknowledge that thought and reframe it in a more compassionate way. Instead of thinking "I'm letting him down," try saying "I'm feeling really concerned about not being able to spend as much time with Jake like I used to. That's making me feel guilty and anxious." Notice how you're acknowledging your emotions and recognizing that they're coming from a place of concern?

When it comes to talking to Jake, it might be helpful to start with a conversation about your feelings and limitations, rather than asking for his permission or validation. You could try saying something like, "Hey Jake, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind. I'm feeling really overwhelmed with my back pain and it's making it hard for me to keep up with our activities like we used to. I'm worried that you might be feeling like I'm not as involved as I used to be, but I want you to know that it's not because I don't care or want to spend time with you, it's just that my body is really limiting me right now."

By framing it in this way, you're taking ownership of your limitations and expressing your concerns, rather than making Jake feel responsible for your pain or limitations. This can help shift the focus from feeling like you're letting him down to feeling like you're having an open and honest conversation about your situation.

How does that sound? Does that feel like a more approachable way to talk to Jake about this?

Patient: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I don't want Jake to feel like he has to take care of me or anything. I just want him to understand why I can't do the things I used to. I'll try that approach next time we talk. Thanks for the help.

Therapist: It sounds like Derek is making progress in understanding self-compassion and how to apply it in his life. He's starting to see that self-compassion isn't about ignoring his struggles or limitations, but rather about acknowledging and accepting them with kindness and understanding.

Derek's concerns about talking to Jake about his limitations are understandable, but the therapist's suggestions can help him approach the conversation in a more open and honest way. By framing it as a conversation about his feelings and limitations, rather than asking for permission or validation, Derek can take ownership of his situation and express his concerns in a way that feels more authentic.

In the next session, it would be helpful to continue working with Derek on applying self-compassion in different situations and exploring ways to maintain open and honest communication with Jake. It may also be helpful to discuss strategies for managing feelings of guilt or anxiety related to his limitations, and to provide support and encouragement as Derek continues to navigate this challenging time.

Some potential topics to explore in the next session could include:

* Continuing to practice self-compassion in daily life, such as using positive affirmations or engaging in self-care activities
* Discussing ways to maintain relationships with friends and family while managing physical limitations
* Exploring strategies for managing feelings of guilt or anxiety related to limitations
* Practicing open and honest communication with Jake about limitations and feelings
* Discussing ways to adapt activities and hobbies to accommodate physical limitations

Overall, it seems like Derek is making progress in understanding and applying self-compassion, and the therapist's guidance and support can continue to help him navigate this challenging time.

Patient: Derek, I'm glad to hear that you're willing to try that approach with Jake. It's a big step, and I'm here to support you through it.

Before we wrap up today's session, I want to touch on something you mentioned earlier about feeling like you're just trying to get by day to day. It's important to recognize that even small steps forward are progress. You're not just surviving; you're actively working on understanding and managing your emotions and limitations. That's something to be proud of.

For our next session, I'd like to continue exploring self-compassion and how it can help you in different areas of your life. We can also delve deeper into strategies for managing feelings of guilt or anxiety related to your limitations. Additionally, I'd like to hear more about how your conversation with Jake goes and any insights you gain from it.

How does that sound to you? Are there any other specific areas you'd like to focus on in our next session?

As for talking to Jake, I haven't had the chance yet. I'm still working up the nerve to have that conversation. But I'll let you know how it goes when I do. 

For our next session, I'd like to focus on managing the guilt and anxiety. It's been eating at me, and I need some practical ways to deal with it. 

Also, I've been thinking about my hobbies. Maybe there's a way to adapt them so I can still enjoy them without pushing myself too hard. Could you give me some ideas on how to do that?

Therapist: Derek, I'm glad you're feeling more comfortable with the concepts of self-compassion and task breakdown. Managing guilt and anxiety can be a challenging but important aspect of coping with chronic pain and physical limitations.

Regarding adapting your hobbies, that's a great area to explore. Many people find that adapting activities can help them maintain a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

1.  **Modify the activity**: Instead of giving up your hobby entirely, try modifying it to accommodate your physical limitations. For example, if you enjoy woodworking but struggle with manual labor, consider switching to a less physically demanding craft, such as wood carving or whittling.
2.  **Find an assistive device**: Explore assistive devices that can help you continue engaging in your hobby. For example, if you enjoy gardening but struggle with bending or heavy lifting, consider using a garden cart or ergonomic gardening tools.
3.  **Adapt your workspace**: Modify your workspace to make it more accessible and comfortable for you. This might involve adjusting the height of your workbench, using a comfortable seating option, or incorporating ergonomic principles into your workspace design.
4.  **Take regular breaks**: Break down your hobby into smaller, more manageable chunks, and take regular breaks to rest and recharge. This can help you avoid exhaustion and maintain your enthusiasm for the activity.
5.  **Seek out community resources**: Look for local resources, such as adaptive sports programs or disability-specific hobby groups, that can provide support and guidance as you adapt your activities to your needs.

These are just a few ideas to get you started. I'd be happy to help you brainstorm more ideas or explore specific adaptations that might work for you.

In terms of managing guilt and anxiety, we can work on developing some practical strategies for reframing negative thoughts and practicing self-forgiveness. We can also explore ways to communicate your needs and boundaries with others, which can help reduce feelings of guilt and anxiety related to your limitations.

For our next session, I'd like to focus on developing a personalized plan for managing guilt and anxiety related to your physical limitations. We can also continue to explore adapting your hobbies and activities to accommodate your needs.

Are there any specific areas you'd like to focus on or any questions you have for me before our next session?

Patient: I appreciate the ideas for adapting my hobbies. I'll definitely look into those. 

As for managing guilt and anxiety, I think I need help with reframing negative thoughts. I tend to get stuck on thinking that I'm not good enough or that I'm a burden. 

Could you give me an example of how to reframe a negative thought? I think seeing it in action might help me understand better.

Therapist: Derek, reframing negative thoughts can be a powerful tool in managing guilt and anxiety. I'd be happy to give you an example.

Let's say you have the thought: "I'm not good enough because I can't do the things I used to." A negative thought like this can lead to feelings of guilt and anxiety. To reframe it, we can try to identify the underlying assumption and challenge it.

For example, we might say: "I'm not good enough because I can't do the things I used to." But is that really true? Can you be good enough even if you can't do the things you used to? Maybe you're good enough in other ways, like being a caring partner, friend, or family member.

A more balanced thought might be: "I'm not the same person I used to be, but that doesn't mean I'm not good enough. I'm still capable of many things, and I'm doing the best I can with my limitations." Notice how this reframed thought acknowledges your limitations while also emphasizing your strengths and capabilities?

Another example might be: "I'm a burden to my family because I can't help out as much as I used to." This thought might lead to feelings of guilt and anxiety. To reframe it, we might say: "I may not be able to help out as much as I used to, but that doesn't mean I'm a burden. My family loves me and values my presence, even if I'm not as physically capable as I used to be."

Remember, reframing negative thoughts is not about denying reality or pretending everything is fine when it's not. It's about challenging unhelpful assumptions and finding more balanced, compassionate ways to think about yourself and your situation.

For our next session, I'd like to help you develop a personalized plan for managing guilt and anxiety related to your physical limitations. We can work on identifying specific negative thoughts, reframing them in a more balanced way, and developing strategies for practicing self-forgiveness and self-compassion. Sound good?

Patient: Yeah, those examples help a lot. I can see how reframing those thoughts could make a difference. 

For our next session, I'd like to focus on developing that personalized plan for managing guilt and anxiety. I think having a clear plan will make it easier to put these ideas into practice. 

Thanks for the help today. I'll see you next time.
