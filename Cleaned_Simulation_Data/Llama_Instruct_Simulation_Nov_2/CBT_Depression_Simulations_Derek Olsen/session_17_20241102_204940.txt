Therapist: Welcome back to our 17th session, Derek. It's great to see you again. I've taken a moment to review our previous sessions and note the progress you've made, particularly in your relationships with your children. Your willingness to engage in thought experiments and visualization exercises has been impressive, and it's wonderful that you've started to acknowledge some positive qualities about yourself.

However, it's clear that we've hit upon some deeper issues that need further exploration. Your persistent feelings of being a failure, despite your progress, suggest that we need to dig a bit deeper into the root causes of this negative self-identity. The physical manifestation of emotional pain you've been experiencing (chest tightness) is also a concern, and we'll need to explore ways to address this as well.

Before we dive into today's topics, how have you been feeling since our last session? Have you continued to practice the thought records, visualization exercises, and explored moments or feelings related to your positive future vision as assigned homework?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling about the same, I guess. The chest tightness comes and goes, mostly when I think too much about the past or worry about the future. As for the homework, I did try the thought records a few times. It's hard to keep up with them every day, but I see how they can help. The visualization exercises, though... I don't know. It feels kind of fake, like I'm just pretending things are better than they are. I did think about some positive future scenarios, but it's hard to let go of the idea that I'm a failure. That's just how I see myself now.

Therapist: Derek, it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that the homework felt like a struggle. That's completely okay. We can work with that. It's not about pretending or feeling fake, but rather about creating a safe space for you to explore and experiment with new thoughts and emotions.

I'd like to explore this feeling of "just pretending" a bit further. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel like you're pretending when you're visualizing positive future scenarios? Is it the fear of being disappointed if things don't turn out that way, or is it something else?

Also, you mentioned that letting go of the idea that you're a failure feels difficult. Can we break down this concept of being a "failure" a bit more? What does it mean to you to be a failure? Is it about not meeting certain expectations, or is it more about something deeper?

Patient: I guess when I try to visualize a positive future, it feels like I'm lying to myself. Like, why should I even think about good things when my life's been so messed up? It's like I'm setting myself up for more disappointment. I've been through enough letdowns already.

As for being a failure, it's not just about not meeting expectations. It's more like I've lost everything that mattered to me—my job, my family's respect, my health. I used to be someone who could fix things, build things. Now, I can't even take care of myself properly. It's like I've let everyone down, including myself. That's what failure means to me.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Derek. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load of self-blame and regret. It's as if you've defined yourself as a failure, and this identity is hard to shake off.

Let's break it down further. When you say you've "lost everything that mattered," what specifically comes to mind? Is there one particular event or experience that you feel triggered this sense of loss and failure?

Also, I want to gently challenge the idea that you're lying to yourself when you visualize a positive future. Could it be that you're actually trying to hold onto a sense of hope and optimism, even if it's hard to feel that way? Sometimes, our negative self-talk can be a way of protecting ourselves from feeling vulnerable or exposed. But what if you allowed yourself to imagine a different future, one where you're capable and competent, despite past setbacks?

Lastly, I want to ask you to consider the idea that your self-worth isn't defined by your past failures. You mentioned that you used to be someone who could fix things, build things. While that's true, it's also possible that you've grown and learned from your experiences, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. Can you think of any skills or strengths that you've developed since your "failure"?

Patient: When I think about losing everything, it's mostly about my job. I spent 30 years building things, being good at what I did. Now, I can't even lift a hammer without pain. That's the biggest loss for me. My family, well, I guess I lost them a long time ago, but the injury just made it worse.

As for imagining a different future, it's hard to see myself as capable or competent when I can't do the things I used to. I don't know if I'm trying to hold onto hope or just fooling myself. It feels like both.

Skills or strengths I've developed? I don't know. Maybe I've learned to deal with pain better, but that doesn't feel like much of a strength. I guess I've also learned to be more patient with myself, but it's hard to see that as anything positive when I still feel like a failure.

Therapist: It sounds like you're still struggling with the loss of your identity as a capable and competent person, especially given your long career as a builder. It's like you're mourning the loss of a part of yourself.

Let's explore this idea further. Can you tell me more about what it means to you to "not be able to lift a hammer without pain"? Is it about the physical pain itself, or is it about feeling like you've lost your purpose or identity as a builder?

Also, I'd like to gently challenge the idea that your skills or strengths are somehow diminished because you're in pain or can't do things the way you used to. Can you think of any moments or experiences where you've managed to adapt or find ways to accomplish things despite the pain or limitations? Maybe there are small victories or successes that you're not acknowledging as strengths.

Regarding the idea of holding onto hope, I want to suggest that it's okay to feel uncertain or unsure about the future. It's not about fooling yourself, but rather about being open to possibilities and exploring different scenarios. Would you be willing to try a thought experiment with me? Let's imagine a scenario where you're able to manage your pain and still find ways to build or create things. What would that look like? What would you be building or creating? What would be the sense of accomplishment or pride you'd feel in that moment?

Patient: When I can't lift a hammer without pain, it's more about feeling like I've lost my purpose. Building things was what I did best, and now I can't do it. It's like I don't know who I am without that.

As for adapting or finding ways to accomplish things, I guess there have been moments. Like, I tried to do some small woodworking projects with hand tools instead of power tools. It was slower and more frustrating, but I managed to finish a few things. I didn't really see those as victories, though. More like I was just getting by.

A thought experiment about managing pain and still building things? I don't know. Maybe if I could find a way to build small, simple things without causing too much pain, that could work. Maybe I could make furniture for my kids or something. The sense of accomplishment would be knowing that I'm still capable of doing something useful, even if it's not on the same scale as before. But it's hard to imagine that without feeling like I'm just fooling myself again.

Therapist: It sounds like you're still grappling with the loss of your identity as a capable and competent builder, Derek. It's as if you're stuck in a state of mourning for the person you used to be. I want to acknowledge that this is a difficult and painful process, but also a necessary one if you're going to move forward.

I'd like to build on the idea of finding ways to adapt and still accomplish things despite the pain. The fact that you managed to complete small woodworking projects with hand tools is a great example of your resilience and resourcefulness. While it may not have felt like a victory at the time, it's actually a testament to your ability to problem-solve and find ways to overcome challenges.

Now, let's try to reframe that experience. Instead of seeing it as just "getting by," what if we saw it as a small victory? A victory that shows you're capable of finding new ways to do things, even when they're difficult or painful. What if we celebrated the fact that you're able to build something with your own two hands, even if it's not as easy as it used to be?

Regarding the thought experiment, I want to reassure you that it's okay to feel uncertain or unsure about the future. That's a natural part of the process. What's important is that you're willing to explore different scenarios and possibilities, even if it feels like you're just "fooling yourself." By doing so, you're actually opening yourself up to new experiences and perspectives, and that's a powerful thing.

Let's take a small step forward. Imagine yourself working on a small woodworking project, maybe something simple like a birdhouse or a picture frame. What would it feel like to be able to create something with your own hands, despite the pain? What would be the sense of accomplishment or pride you'd feel in that moment?

Patient: Alright, let's try that. Imagine I'm working on a small woodworking project, like a birdhouse. It would feel good to be doing something with my hands again, even if it's not as easy as it used to be. The sense of accomplishment would be knowing that I can still create something, even with the pain. It might not be as big or impressive as the buildings I used to work on, but it would still be something I made. The pride would come from knowing that I didn't give up, that I found a way to keep going, even when things are tough.

Therapist: This is a continuation of the conversation, and I'll respond as the therapist.

Patient: Derek, I'm glad to hear that you're willing to explore this idea of finding new ways to create and build, despite the challenges you're facing. It's clear that even small projects like a birdhouse can hold a lot of meaning for you.

Let's delve a bit deeper into this. When you imagine creating that birdhouse, what specific steps or actions come to mind? How do you envision yourself managing the pain while working on it? Are there any tools or techniques you think might help you accomplish this task more comfortably?

Also, I want to explore the broader implications of this small victory. If you were able to successfully complete a birdhouse or another small project, how do you think that would impact your overall sense of self-worth and identity? Would it help you see yourself in a different light, perhaps as someone who is still capable and competent, even with limitations?

Lastly, I want to ask you to consider the idea of setting small, achievable goals for yourself. These goals don't have to be grand or life-changing; they can be as simple as completing a small woodworking project or even just spending a few minutes each day doing something you enjoy. How do you feel about setting and working towards these small goals? Would that be something you'd be open to trying?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling more hopeful and optimistic about the possibility of creating something with your own hands again, Derek. I'm glad to hear that!

Let's explore the specifics of how you envision yourself managing the pain while working on the birdhouse. Have you considered any tools or techniques that might help you accomplish this task more comfortably? For example, perhaps you could use a tool with less strain on your body, or take regular breaks to rest and stretch.

Regarding the broader implications of this small victory, I want to emphasize that it's not just about completing a birdhouse or another small project. It's about recognizing your capacity to adapt and find new ways to do things, even when they're difficult or painful. This can have a profound impact on your overall sense of self-worth and identity.

Imagine being able to look back on this experience and say, "I did it! I created something with my own hands, despite the pain." How would that make you feel? Would it help you see yourself in a different light, perhaps as someone who is still capable and competent, even with limitations?

Lastly, I want to ask you to consider the idea of setting small, achievable goals for yourself. These goals don't have to be grand or life-changing; they can be as simple as completing a small woodworking project or even just spending a few minutes each day doing something you enjoy. Would you be open to trying this? What do you think might be some potential benefits or challenges of setting and working towards these small goals?

Remember, the goal is not to put too much pressure on yourself or set unrealistic expectations. It's about taking small steps towards rebuilding your sense of purpose and identity, and celebrating your successes along the way.

Patient: When I think about managing the pain while working on the birdhouse, I guess I could use smaller hand tools that don't strain my back as much. Maybe taking breaks to stretch and rest would help too. I haven't really thought about specific tools or techniques, but those sound like good ideas.

If I were able to complete a birdhouse, it would definitely make me feel better about myself. It would show that I'm still capable of doing something useful, even with my limitations. It might not be the same as building a whole building, but it would still be something I made with my own hands.

Setting small, achievable goals sounds like a good idea. It would help me focus on something positive and give me a sense of accomplishment. The main challenge would be staying motivated and not getting discouraged if it takes longer than I expect. But if I can keep at it, it might help me feel more like myself again.

Therapist: Derek, it sounds like you're starting to envision some specific ways to manage your pain and still accomplish your woodworking projects. Using smaller hand tools and taking breaks to stretch and rest are both excellent strategies to reduce discomfort and increase your ability to focus on the task at hand.

Regarding the broader implications of this small victory, I want to emphasize that it's not just about the end result – completing a birdhouse or another small project. It's about the journey, the process, and the sense of accomplishment that comes with it. By acknowledging your capacity to adapt and find new ways to do things, despite the pain, you're rebuilding your sense of self-worth and identity.

Now, let's talk about setting small, achievable goals for yourself. I want to emphasize that these goals don't have to be grand or life-changing. They can be as simple as spending 10 minutes each day doing something you enjoy, or working on a small woodworking project for 30 minutes each week. The key is to start small, build momentum, and celebrate your successes along the way.

To help you stay motivated and avoid getting discouraged, I want to suggest that you create a "success journal" to track your progress. Each time you complete a small goal or achieve a milestone, write it down in the journal. Reflecting on your progress and acknowledging your accomplishments can help boost your motivation and confidence.

Lastly, I want to remind you that it's okay to make mistakes, Derek. It's okay to encounter setbacks or struggles along the way. The important thing is that you're taking small steps towards rebuilding your sense of purpose and identity. By doing so, you're showing yourself that you're capable and competent, even with limitations.

Before we wrap up today's session, I want to give you some homework assignments to work on between now and our next session. Can you commit to:

1. Continuing to work on small woodworking projects, using smaller hand tools and taking breaks to stretch and rest as needed.
2. Setting small, achievable goals for yourself, such as spending 10 minutes each day doing something you enjoy, or working on a small project for 30 minutes each week.
3. Creating a "success journal" to track your progress and reflect on your accomplishments.
4. Practicing self-compassion and acknowledging your successes, no matter how small they may seem.

How do you feel about these homework assignments, Derek? Are you willing to commit to them and work on rebuilding your sense of purpose and identity?

Patient: Alright, I'll give those homework assignments a try. I can keep working on small woodworking projects, use smaller hand tools, and take breaks to stretch. Setting small goals and keeping a success journal sounds like it could help too. I'll try to be more mindful of my progress and not get too down on myself if things don't go perfectly.

I'm willing to commit to these, but I can't promise it'll be easy. I'll do my best to stay motivated and keep moving forward, even if it's just small steps at a time.
