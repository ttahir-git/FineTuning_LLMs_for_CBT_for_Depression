Thank you for your clear direction, Naomi. Let's plan to focus on those two key areas in our next session. Before we end today's session, I want to make sure we have a clear plan moving forward.

**Homework for Next Session:**

1. For communicating with your mom:
- Write down specific examples of situations where communication has been challenging
- Brainstorm what you'd ideally like to express to her about your identity
- Note any specific concerns or fears you have about these conversations

2. For academic/mental health balance:
- Track your daily activities and stress levels for the next week
- Identify times when you feel most overwhelmed
- List current self-care practices that help you manage stress

3. Consider downloading one or two of the suggested apps to try before our next session

**Final Thoughts:**
You've shown great insight today in recognizing what you need to work on. Remember to be patient with yourself as you practice these new skills and strategies.

Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end today's session?

Therapist: Welcome back, Naomi. Congratulations on making it to your 12th session! I'm glad to see that we've been able to work through some significant topics together.

You've made a lot of progress in identifying areas where you'd like to see improvement, and I'm impressed by your willingness to take on new skills and strategies. Before we wrap up today, I want to check in with you about your homework. Have you had a chance to start working on the tasks we discussed for next time?

Also, I want to hear more about how you're feeling about the upcoming conversations with your mom. Are there any specific concerns or fears that are standing out to you right now?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the welcome back. It's been a challenging but insightful journey so far.

Regarding the homework, I've started jotting down some examples of challenging communication with my mom. It's been tough, especially when she still uses feminine pronouns and seems disappointed by my appearance. I've also brainstormed what I'd ideally like to express to her, like how important it is for me to be seen and respected for who I am.

As for the academic/mental health balance, I've been tracking my daily activities and stress levels. I notice that I feel most overwhelmed around midterms and when I have multiple deadlines close together. I've been trying to incorporate more self-care practices, like taking short walks and cooking vegetarian meals, which help a bit.

For the upcoming conversations with my mom, my biggest fear is that she won't understand or will react negatively, which could strain our relationship further. I'm also worried about how my dad might react, as he tends to be more traditional and less open-minded.

Therapist: Naomi, thank you for being so open and honest about your experiences and concerns. It takes a lot of courage to explore these topics, and I'm proud of the progress you've made so far.

It sounds like you've taken a good first step in identifying specific examples of challenging communication with your mom, which will be helpful in our next session. It's also great to hear that you've been able to brainstorm what you'd like to express to her about your identity. Remember, your identity and self-expression are valid and deserve respect.

Regarding your academic/mental health balance, it's not surprising that you feel overwhelmed during midterms and when you have multiple deadlines close together. This is a common challenge many students face. I'm glad to hear that you've been incorporating self-care practices, such as short walks and cooking vegetarian meals. These small moments of self-care can make a big difference in your well-being.

Now, let's talk more about the upcoming conversations with your mom. It's completely understandable that you're worried about how she might react. However, I want to encourage you to focus on what you can control, which is your own expression and communication of your needs. It might be helpful to reframe your thinking around this conversation. Instead of worrying about how your mom might react, try to focus on what you want to achieve in this conversation, which is to be seen and respected for who you are.

We can also work on some strategies to help you feel more prepared and confident for these conversations. Perhaps we can explore some role-playing exercises to help you practice expressing yourself in a way that feels authentic and comfortable for you.

What do you think? Is there anything in particular that you'd like to focus on or work on in our next session?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. It means a lot to hear that you're proud of the progress I've made.

I think the role-playing exercises sound like a good idea. It could help me feel more prepared and less anxious about the conversation with my mom. I'm also curious about any other strategies you might suggest for managing my stress during busy academic periods.

For our next session, I'd like to focus on both the role-playing exercises and any additional self-care strategies that could help me during intense academic times. I'm open to trying new things, especially if they can make a difference in how I cope with stress.
