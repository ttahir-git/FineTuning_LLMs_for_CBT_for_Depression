Therapist: Welcome back, Naomi! I'm glad we can continue our work together. Before we dive in, how did you find the homework tasks and thought records practice? Were there any challenges or successes you'd like to share from the past week?

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to be back. I found the thought records practice really helpful, especially when I was feeling overwhelmed by a deadline. I was able to identify some of those all-or-nothing thinking patterns, like when I thought, "If I don't get this paper perfect, I'm a failure." Reframing that into something more compassionate, like "It's okay to make mistakes; I'm still learning," made a big difference.

However, I did struggle a bit with asking for help. I had a lab report that was due, and even though I knew I needed assistance, I hesitated to reach out to my professor. I ended up staying up all night trying to figure it out on my own, which wasn't great for my mental health. I guess I still have some work to do on that front.

Therapist: Great to hear that the thought records practice has been helpful for you, Naomi! It's amazing how often we can get stuck in those all-or-nothing thinking patterns, and reframing them can make such a big difference in how we feel.

I'm also glad you acknowledged your struggles with asking for help. That's a big step, and it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling with that. It's completely normal to have trouble asking for help, especially if you're someone who values independence or perfectionism.

Can we explore this a bit further? What do you think was going through your mind when you hesitated to ask for help from your professor? Was there a specific fear or thought that was holding you back?

Patient: Yeah, I think part of it was the fear of being seen as incompetent or not good enough. I've always been the "smart one" in my family, and I guess I carry that expectation with me. The thought that kept popping up was, "If I ask for help, they'll think I'm not capable." It's like I was trying to prove something to myself and others, even though it was causing me more stress.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that with me, Naomi. It sounds like you were caught in a bit of a perfectionistic trap, where you felt like you had to prove your worth by doing things on your own, even when it's not necessary.

It's interesting that you mentioned feeling like the "smart one" in your family. Can you tell me more about what that means to you, and how that expectation has shaped your behavior over time?

It's also worth exploring the idea that asking for help doesn't mean you're incompetent or not good enough. In fact, it's often a sign of strength and self-awareness. By asking for help, you're acknowledging that you need support, and that's okay.

Let's try to reframe that thought, "If I ask for help, they'll think I'm not capable." Can we turn that into something more compassionate and realistic? For example, "I'm taking a step towards asking for help, and that takes courage." or "I'm acknowledging that I need support, and that's okay." How does that sound?

Patient: That makes sense. Being the "smart one" in my family has always been a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's a source of pride and validation, but on the other, it puts a lot of pressure on me to always be the best. I think it's shaped my behavior in a way that makes me hesitant to show any vulnerability or weakness, even if it means pushing myself too hard.

Reframing that thought to something like, "I'm taking a step towards asking for help, and that takes courage," does feel a bit more empowering. It's a reminder that it's okay to need support and that asking for help is a positive step, not a sign of failure. I'll try to keep that in mind moving forward.

Therapist: I'm glad we could explore this further, Naomi. It sounds like you're starting to see how your perfectionistic tendencies and need for validation are connected to your behavior. Recognizing this pattern is a huge step forward, and I'm proud of you for being so self-aware.

I want to build on the reframing exercise we did. Let's take it a step further. Can you think of other situations where you might be able to apply this reframed thought? For example, what if you're struggling with a project at work or a personal goal? Would you be willing to ask for help, knowing that it's a sign of strength and not weakness?

Also, let's talk about self-compassion. We discussed this in our previous session, but I want to check in with you about how you've been practicing self-compassion. Have you been able to treat yourself with kindness and understanding when you make mistakes or ask for help?

Remember, self-compassion is not about being perfect; it's about being gentle and understanding with yourself as you navigate life's challenges. Can you tell me about a time when you've been able to practice self-compassion, and how it made you feel?

Finally, I'd like to introduce a new technique to help you build confidence in asking for help. It's called the "Ask for Help" script. Would you like to try it out? The script is a simple phrase that you can use when asking for help, such as, "Hi, I'm having trouble with [insert task]. Can you help me understand [specific aspect]?" or "I'm feeling overwhelmed with [task]. Can we break it down together?"

Let me know if you're interested in trying this out, and we can practice it together.

Patient: Sure, I can think of a few situations where I could apply that reframed thought. For example, when I'm struggling with a research project, I often feel like I have to do everything on my own. But now, I can remind myself that asking for help is a sign of strength and not weakness. I could ask my lab partner or a professor for guidance, knowing that it's okay to need support.

As for self-compassion, I've been trying to practice it more, especially when I make mistakes. Last week, I missed a deadline for a paper because I was feeling overwhelmed. Instead of beating myself up, I told myself, "It's okay, Naomi. You're doing your best, and it's okay to ask for an extension." It felt a bit strange at first, but it also made me feel less anxious and more understanding of my own struggles.

I'm definitely interested in trying out the "Ask for Help" script. It sounds like a practical way to approach asking for help without feeling like I'm burdening others. Can you give me an example of how to use it in a real situation?

Therapist: Here is the continuation of the conversation:.

Patient: Absolutely, Naomi. Let's walk through an example of how you might use the "Ask for Help" script in a real situation.

Imagine you're working on a complex lab experiment, and you're stuck on a particular step. You're feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to proceed. Here's how you could use the script:

1. Identify the specific task or aspect you need help with: "I'm having trouble with the data analysis step of our lab experiment."
2. Phrase your request clearly and respectfully: "Can you help me understand how to interpret the results?"

So, the full script might look like this:
"Hi [Lab Partner's Name], I'm having trouble with the data analysis step of our lab experiment. Can you help me understand how to interpret the results?"

This approach helps you be specific about what you need help with, which makes it easier for the other person to assist you. It also frames the request in a way that acknowledges your effort and willingness to learn, rather than making it seem like you're asking for a complete handout.

Would you like to practice this script with me? We can role-play a scenario where you need to ask for help with a task or project. This will help you get comfortable with the phrasing and build your confidence in asking for help.

Let me know if you're ready to give it a try!

Therapist: I'd be happy to continue the conversation as the therapist.

Patient: Great! Let's role-play a scenario where you need to ask for help with a task or project. Imagine you're working on a group project for one of your classes, and you're struggling with a particular section of the report. You want to ask one of your group members for assistance.

Here's how you might use the "Ask for Help" script:

1. Identify the specific task or aspect you need help with: "I'm having trouble with the literature review section of our group project."
2. Phrase your request clearly and respectfully: "Can you help me understand how to structure it better?"

So, the full script might look like this:
"Hi [Group Member's Name], I'm having trouble with the literature review section of our group project. Can you help me understand how to structure it better?"

This approach helps you be specific about what you need help with, which makes it easier for the other person to assist you. It also frames the request in a way that acknowledges your effort and willingness to learn, rather than making it seem like you're asking for a complete handout.
