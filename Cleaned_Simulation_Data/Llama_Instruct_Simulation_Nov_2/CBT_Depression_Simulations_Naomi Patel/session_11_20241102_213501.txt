Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's wonderful to see you again in session 12. I'd love to hear how you've been doing since our last session. You mentioned in your summary that you've been practicing the "pause, breathe, and reframe" technique, and that's great to hear. Can you tell me a bit more about how that's been going for you? Have you found yourself using it in daily situations, especially with your family regarding pronouns and identity?

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to be back. The "pause, breathe, and reframe" technique has actually been really helpful. I've started using it more often, especially when I feel overwhelmed or when I'm about to interact with my family. It gives me a moment to collect myself before diving into a potentially stressful conversation. 

With my family, I've been trying to use it before correcting them on pronouns. It's made those moments less confrontational and more about calmly explaining how I feel. It's still not perfect, but it's definitely an improvement.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It takes a lot of courage to use this technique, especially when it's with family. I'm glad to hear that it's been helpful for you. It sounds like you're making progress in using this technique to manage your emotions and interact with your family in a more calm and assertive way.

I notice that you mention it's "not perfect" yet, and that's okay. CBT is all about small steps towards change, and it sounds like you're taking some great steps. Can you tell me more about what "not perfect" means in this context? What do you think would need to happen for you to feel like you're using the technique more effectively with your family?

Also, I'm curious - what do you think is the most challenging part of using this technique with your family? Is it a particular family member, a specific situation, or something else?

Patient: Yeah, "not perfect" means there are still moments when I get flustered or forget to use the technique. For example, last week, my mom called me "she" in front of some relatives, and I just snapped at her without pausing or breathing. It led to an argument, and I felt really bad afterward.

I think for me to use the technique more effectively, I need to set more reminders or cues for myself. Maybe putting sticky notes around my room or setting phone alerts. It's easy to forget when I'm in the heat of the moment.

The most challenging part is definitely dealing with my mom. She's the one who still struggles the most with my identity. Anytime we're in a social setting or around extended family, she reverts back to old habits. It's frustrating because I know she loves me, but it feels like she's not trying hard enough to understand.

Therapist: Naomi, it sounds like you're being very honest with yourself about the challenges you're still facing, and that's a great sign of growth. It's understandable that you'd feel frustrated with your mom's behavior, especially when it feels like she's not making enough effort to understand you.

One thing to keep in mind is that you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to them. The "pause, breathe, and reframe" technique can be a powerful tool in helping you respond more calmly and assertively, even when faced with difficult situations.

Let's explore this idea of setting reminders or cues for yourself to use the technique. It might be helpful to brainstorm some specific strategies that could work for you, such as the sticky notes or phone alerts you mentioned. What about other ideas, like putting a note on your bathroom mirror or setting a specific phrase that you repeat to yourself before interacting with your family?

Also, I want to gently challenge your assumption that your mom "isn't trying hard enough" to understand you. While it's true that she may not be using the pronouns you prefer, it's also possible that she's struggling with her own biases or discomfort. This doesn't mean she doesn't love you, but rather that she may need more education or support to understand and respect your identity.

Can you think of a time when your mom did try to use the correct pronouns, and how that felt for you? Was there something specific that helped her understand and change her behavior in that moment?

Patient: You're right, I can't control how others behave, but I can control my response. Setting reminders is a good idea. I like the idea of a specific phrase to repeat before interacting with my family. Maybe something like "stay calm, stay patient."

As for my mom, you're right; she might be struggling with her own biases. I remember a time when she accidentally used the right pronouns during a casual conversation. It felt really validating, like she was finally getting it. I think what helped was me showing her articles and videos about non-binary identities. It wasn't a one-time thing; it took multiple conversations and resources for her to start getting it.

I guess I need to be more patient and keep providing her with information. It's just hard when it feels like progress is so slow.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making great progress in using the "pause, breathe, and reframe" technique, and it's wonderful that you're taking steps to adapt it to your specific needs, such as setting reminders or cues for yourself. Remembering to repeat a specific phrase like "stay calm, stay patient" can be a powerful way to help you stay grounded in those moments when you might feel overwhelmed.

I'm also glad that we could have a nuanced conversation about your mom's behavior and the complexities surrounding her understanding of your identity. It's understandable that progress might feel slow, but it's great that you're recognizing the importance of providing her with resources and information to help her better understand.

Let's talk more about what it means to be patient and understanding with your mom. What does patience look like for you in this context? Is it about tolerating her mistakes, or is it about having a genuine desire to help her learn and grow alongside you?

Also, I want to gently suggest that instead of focusing on "progress" being slow, we might frame it as "incremental steps towards understanding and connection." Every small step forward, no matter how slow it may feel, is a testament to the effort and dedication you're both putting in.

Lastly, I'd like to introduce a new concept to explore: self-compassion in the face of frustration. When you feel frustrated with your mom's behavior, what are some kind and understanding things you can say to yourself in that moment? Can you practice acknowledging and accepting your emotions, rather than beating yourself up over them?

Patient: Patience in this context means being willing to have ongoing conversations and providing her with resources without expecting immediate change. It's about recognizing that she's trying, even if it's not perfect. I guess it's more about having a genuine desire to help her learn and grow alongside me.

I like the idea of framing it as "incremental steps towards understanding and connection." It makes the process feel more positive and less frustrating.

Self-compassion in the face of frustration is something I struggle with. When I feel frustrated with my mom, I usually tell myself things like "Why can't she just get it?" or "I shouldn't have to explain this again." But I see how that's not helpful. Maybe I can practice saying things like "It's okay to feel frustrated, but it's also okay to give her time to learn." Or "I'm doing my best, and that's enough."

It's hard to shift my mindset, but I think it could make a big difference in how I handle these situations.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making some great strides in your progress, Naomi. I'm impressed by your willingness to explore new strategies and perspectives, particularly in regards to your relationship with your mom. It's not always easy to acknowledge and work with someone who may be struggling to understand your identity, but it's clear that you're committed to finding ways to communicate and connect with her.

I want to emphasize that patience, in this context, is not about tolerating your mom's mistakes, but about being willing to engage in ongoing conversations and provide her with the resources she needs to grow and learn. It's a sign of strength and understanding that you're recognizing her efforts and wanting to help her improve.

The idea of framing progress as "incremental steps towards understanding and connection" is a wonderful way to reframe your mindset. It can be easy to get caught up in the idea that progress should be rapid, but it's essential to remember that growth and change take time, especially when working with someone who may be struggling to understand.

Regarding self-compassion in the face of frustration, I'm so glad you're recognizing the importance of acknowledging and accepting your emotions, rather than beating yourself up over them. Practicing self-compassion can be challenging, but it's an essential tool for maintaining your emotional well-being, especially in situations where you feel frustrated or stuck.

Let's work on some specific self-compassion exercises that you can practice in the moments when you feel frustrated with your mom. What if, instead of saying "Why can't she just get it?" or "I shouldn't have to explain this again," you practiced saying something like "I'm feeling frustrated right now, but I'm doing my best to communicate with her. I'm proud of myself for trying to educate her and help her understand." Or, "It's okay to feel frustrated, but I'm also recognizing that she's trying to learn and grow."

Remember, the goal is not to change your mom, but to cultivate a sense of self-compassion and understanding that will help you navigate these challenging situations with greater ease.

Before we wrap up this session, I want to assign you some homework to practice these new skills. Can you commit to practicing the "pause, breathe, and reframe" technique in at least three different situations over the next week, and to writing down your thoughts and feelings in a journal after each situation? I'd also like you to practice self-compassion exercises in the face of frustration, and to come to our next session prepared to share any insights or challenges you've encountered.

How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds good, Nova. I'll commit to practicing the "pause, breathe, and reframe" technique in at least three different situations this week and journaling about them. I'll also work on those self-compassion exercises when I feel frustrated with my mom.

I'm looking forward to seeing how these practices help me in the coming week. Thanks for the guidance and support.
