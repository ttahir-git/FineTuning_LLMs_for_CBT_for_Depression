Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again for our 4th session. I want to start by acknowledging the progress you've made so far, and I'm impressed with the effort you've put into practicing new coping strategies and thought records. 

Let's dive deeper into what we discussed last time and see how you've been doing with implementing those strategies. What have you been working on since our last session? Have you found any challenges in using the "Ask for Help" script, or have you made any progress with thought records and stress management?

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to be back. Since our last session, I've been focusing on a few things. I've been trying to use the "Ask for Help" script more, especially when I feel overwhelmed with my coursework. It's been a bit awkward at first, but I think it's getting easier. I even asked a classmate for some study tips last week, and it went better than I expected.

With the thought records, I've been keeping them up, especially when I start feeling stressed about my deadlines. It's helping me to see how my thoughts can spiral out of control sometimes. I'm still working on being more compassionate with myself when I make mistakes, but it's a process.

For stress management, I've been sticking to my routine of cooking, writing poetry, and doing some yoga. Cooking has been a great way to unwind, and I feel more connected to my cultural roots while doing it. Poetry has also been a good outlet for expressing my feelings.

Overall, I think I'm making progress, but there are still moments when I feel really stuck. I had a particularly tough day last week where I felt like I couldn't concentrate at all, and I ended up cutting myself again. It's frustrating because I thought I was doing better, but I guess it's a reminder that this is a long journey.

Therapist: Naomi, it's great to see you've been actively working on implementing the strategies we discussed. It's wonderful that you're using the "Ask for Help" script more and finding it's getting easier. Asking for help is indeed a sign of strength, and it's great that you're practicing it.

It's also fantastic that you're keeping up with your thought records, especially when feeling stressed about deadlines. Recognizing how your thoughts can spiral out of control is a huge step, and it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that. And I'm glad to hear that you're being kind to yourself, even when making mistakes. That's a crucial part of developing a compassionate mindset.

I'm also delighted to hear that you're enjoying your stress management routine, especially cooking and writing poetry. It's great that you're finding activities that bring you joy and help you unwind. Remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's normal for setbacks to occur. What's important is that you're acknowledging your struggles and being kind to yourself.

The fact that you cut yourself last week is a reminder that you're working with a complex issue, and it's not something that's going to disappear overnight. But it's not a failure either. It's a signal that you're pushing yourself too hard, and it's time to take a step back and reassess your approach.

Can you tell me more about what happened last week? What was going on that made you feel overwhelmed, and what do you think triggered the self-harm?

Also, let's talk about your values-based approach. What do you think are some key values that you're trying to uphold in your daily life? Are there any values that you think are important to you, but you're struggling to live up to?

Patient: Last week was particularly tough because I had multiple deadlines all at once. I had a big research paper due, a presentation for my environmental science class, and a poetry submission for a local magazine. I felt like I couldn't keep up with everything, and the pressure was really intense. I started feeling like I was failing at everything, even though I knew logically that it was just a temporary situation.

The trigger for the self-harm was when I couldn't concentrate on my work, and I kept making mistakes. I felt like I was letting myself down, and the frustration built up until I couldn't handle it anymore. I know it's not a healthy way to cope, but in that moment, it felt like the only way to release the tension.

As for my values, honesty, compassion, and creativity are definitely the key ones for me. I try to be honest with myself and others, even when it's difficult. Compassion is important because I want to treat myself and others with kindness, especially when things get tough. Creativity is a big part of who I am, and I want to express myself through my writing and cooking.

However, I do struggle with living up to these values sometimes, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed. For example, I find it hard to be compassionate with myself when I make mistakes, and I tend to be overly critical. I also struggle with being honest about my feelings with my family
