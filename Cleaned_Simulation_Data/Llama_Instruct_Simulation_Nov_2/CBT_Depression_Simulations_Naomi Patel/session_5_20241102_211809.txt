Therapist: Welcome back to our 5th CBT session, Naomi! It's great to see you've made progress in implementing some of the strategies we discussed in the previous session. I'd like to acknowledge your efforts in asking for help, maintaining your stress management routine, and identifying your core values.

Before we dive into new topics, can you tell me a bit more about what's been on your mind since our last session? What are some of the things you've been struggling with, and what do you hope to work on during our time together today?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's been a mix of ups and downs since our last session. On the positive side, I've been sticking to my stress management routine, especially cooking and writing poetry. It really helps to have those outlets. But I've also had a few rough patches. I had another self-harm incident last week when I felt completely overwhelmed by a sudden influx of deadlines and a disagreement with my advisor. I'm still finding it hard to show self-compassion during those moments, even though I know it's something I need to work on. Today, I'd like to focus on how to better manage those overwhelming feelings and maybe explore some new coping strategies that don't involve self-harm.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your experiences and insights, Naomi. It sounds like you've made some good progress in your stress management routine, and that's something to be proud of. At the same time, it's completely understandable that you're struggling with self-harm incidents, especially when you feel overwhelmed.

Before we dive into new coping strategies, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling. It's a testament to your self-awareness and commitment to your well-being that you're willing to face these challenges head-on.

One thing that stood out to me is your recognition of the connection between overwhelming pressure and your self-harm behavior. This is a crucial insight, and we can definitely build on it. It's also interesting that you mentioned the disagreement with your advisor as a trigger. Can you tell me more about that interaction? What specifically felt overwhelming or upsetting about it?

Additionally, since you mentioned struggling with showing self-compassion during stressful periods, I'd like to explore that further. When you're in the midst of feeling overwhelmed, what are some thoughts or self-statements that pop up in your mind? Are there any specific self-criticisms or negative self-talk patterns that you're aware of?

Patient: The disagreement with my advisor was about my research progress. They wanted me to shift my focus to a different aspect of my project, which felt like a setback because I had already invested so much time and energy into the original direction. It felt like all my hard work was being dismissed, and I couldn't help but think, "Why can't I just get this right?" or "I'm not good enough." Those thoughts really spiraled, and I ended up feeling like I was failing at everything.

When I'm overwhelmed, I often tell myself things like, "You should be able to handle this," or "Everyone else seems to manage just fine, why can't you?" It's like I'm constantly comparing myself to others and coming up short. I know these thoughts aren't helpful, but they feel so automatic.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing more about the disagreement with your advisor and the thoughts that followed. It sounds like a really tough and frustrating situation. I want to acknowledge that it's completely reasonable to feel upset and uncertain when someone dismisses your hard work and ideas.

Those thoughts you mentioned, like "You should be able to handle this" or "Everyone else seems to manage just fine, why can't you?" are actually classic examples of all-or-nothing thinking and social comparison. These thought patterns can be really unhelpful, especially when you're already feeling overwhelmed.

It's great that you're aware of these thoughts, Naomi, because now we can start to work on reframing them. I'd like to introduce you to a technique called cognitive restructuring. We can work on identifying and challenging these negative thought patterns, and finding more balanced and realistic ways of thinking.

For example, instead of thinking "You should be able to handle this," what would happen if you told yourself, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now, and that's okay. I can take a step back and ask for help if I need it." Or instead of thinking "Everyone else seems to manage just fine, why can't you?", what if you said, "I don't know how others are doing it, but I can focus on my own strengths and weaknesses right now."

Let's practice some cognitive restructuring exercises to help you become more aware of your thoughts and start to challenge them in a more constructive way. Are you ready to give it a try?

Patient: Yes, I'm ready to give it a try. I think it's a good idea to start challenging those thoughts. It's just so automatic sometimes, and I don't even realize I'm doing it until after the fact. So, how do we start with this cognitive restructuring? Do you have an example or exercise we can use to practice?

Therapist: Let's start with a specific example that we've discussed already. You mentioned the thought "You should be able to handle this" during the disagreement with your advisor. Let's break it down together.

1. **Identify the thought**: You've already identified the thought as "You should be able to handle this."
2. **Evaluate the evidence**: Now, let's think about the evidence for and against this thought. Can you think of times when you've actually handled challenging situations successfully? Maybe there have been times when you felt overwhelmed, but you managed to find a solution or ask for help.
3. **Identify the underlying assumption**: What's the underlying assumption behind this thought? Is it that you're supposed to be perfect or that you're somehow failing if you don't handle everything on your own? Let's explore those assumptions together.
4. **Challenge the thought**: Once we've identified the evidence and assumptions, let's challenge the thought. What's a more balanced and realistic way of thinking about this situation? As I mentioned earlier, you could say to yourself, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now, and that's okay. I can take a step back and ask for help if I need it."

Now, let's try an exercise. I'll give you a scenario, and you can practice cognitive restructuring.

**Exercise:**

Imagine you're in a meeting with your academic advisor, and they're expressing concerns about your research progress. They're saying that you're not meeting deadlines, and you're starting to feel overwhelmed. Write down three thoughts that come up for you in response. Then, using cognitive restructuring, rewrite each thought in a more balanced and realistic way.

Take your time, and don't worry about getting it "right." This is a practice exercise, and it's okay if it takes some time to get the hang of it.

Patient: Sure, let's give it a try.

**Scenario:**

In a meeting with my academic advisor, they express concerns about my research progress, saying I'm not meeting deadlines, and I start to feel overwhelmed.

**Initial Thoughts:**

1. "I should be able to handle this on my own."
2. "Everyone else seems to be doing fine, why can't I?"
3. "I'm failing, and I'll never catch up."

**Rewritten Thoughts:**

1. "It's okay to feel overwhelmed. I can ask for help if I need it."
2. "I don't know how others are managing, but I can focus on my own progress and ask for support when needed."
3. "It's a setback, but I can create a plan to catch up and seek guidance from my advisor or peers."

How does that sound, Nova?

Therapist: **Therapist:** Naomi, your rewritten thoughts look great! It's fantastic that you were able to identify the negative thoughts and reframe them in a more balanced and realistic way. These new thoughts are much more helpful and empowering.

Let's break down what we've done here:

1. **Identify the thought**: You've successfully identified the initial thoughts that came up in response to the scenario.
2. **Evaluate the evidence**: By examining the evidence for and against each thought, you were able to see that there are alternative perspectives and that these thoughts might not be entirely accurate.
3. **Identify the underlying assumption**: You've caught on to the underlying assumptions behind these thoughts, such as the need to be perfect or the expectation that you should be able to handle everything on your own.
4. **Challenge the thought**: By rewriting the thoughts in a more balanced and realistic way, you've challenged the initial negative thoughts and replaced them with more helpful and constructive ones.

This exercise is just the beginning of your cognitive restructuring journey, Naomi. With practice, you'll become more aware of your thoughts and develop the skills to challenge and reframe them in a more helpful way.

Now, let's discuss how you can apply this technique to your daily life, especially when faced with overwhelming situations. Remember, cognitive restructuring is a skill that takes time and practice to develop, but the more you use it, the more effective it will become.

Here are some homework tasks to help you continue practicing cognitive restructuring:

1. **Thought records**: Keep a thought record for the next week, tracking your thoughts when you feel overwhelmed or anxious. Try to identify any negative thoughts, evaluate the evidence for and against them, and challenge them using cognitive restructuring.
2. **Self-compassion practice**: Commit to practicing self-compassion daily, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. This can involve activities like journaling, meditation, or simply taking a few deep breaths and acknowledging your emotions.
3. **Stress management routine**: Continue to maintain and expand your stress management routine, incorporating activities that bring you joy and help you relax.

By working on these tasks and continuing to practice cognitive restructuring, you'll become more confident in your ability to manage overwhelming situations and develop a more compassionate relationship with yourself.

How do you feel about these homework tasks, Naomi? Do you have any questions or concerns?

Patient: I think these homework tasks sound really helpful. I'm definitely going to keep a thought record for the next week. It's a good way to keep track of my thoughts and see how I can challenge them. I've also been trying to practice self-compassion more, so I'll keep doing that.

One thing I'm a bit concerned about is how to apply this technique in real-time, especially when I'm in the middle of a stressful situation. It's one thing to do it in a calm session like this, but it might be harder to remember and apply when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Do you have any tips for that?

Therapist: It's completely normal to feel uncertain about how to apply cognitive restructuring in real-time, Naomi. One tip I'd like to share with you is to start small and be kind to yourself. It might take some time to develop this skill, and it's okay if you don't get it right immediately.

One strategy you can try is to create a simple phrase or reminder that you can use in the moment when you feel overwhelmed. This could be something like, "Pause, breathe, and reframe." Repeat this phrase to yourself when you start to feel anxious or overwhelmed, and take a deep breath in as you say it. This can help you slow down and create a small moment of space to reframe your thoughts.

Another idea is to keep a small piece of paper or a note on your phone with a list of questions that you can ask yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed. For example, "What's the evidence for and against this thought?", "What's the underlying assumption behind this thought?", or "Is there a more balanced way of thinking about this situation?" These questions can help you shift your focus away from negative thoughts and towards more constructive and realistic ones.

Additionally, you might find it helpful to practice cognitive restructuring in low-stakes situations first. For example, when you're watching a movie or TV show and you start to get caught up in negative thoughts, you can try practicing cognitive restructuring on those thoughts. This can help you build your skills in a more relaxed and low-pressure environment.

Remember, the goal of cognitive restructuring isn't to eliminate negative thoughts entirely, but to learn how to manage them in a more constructive way. It's okay if you slip up sometimes, and it's okay to take your time developing this skill. With practice and patience, you'll become more confident in your ability to apply cognitive restructuring in real-time.

How do you feel about these suggestions, Naomi? Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Patient: Those suggestions make a lot of sense, Nova. I think having a simple phrase like "Pause, breathe, and reframe" is a good idea. It's something I can easily remember and use when I'm feeling overwhelmed. And keeping a list of questions on my phone is also a practical way to remind myself to challenge my thoughts.

I'll definitely start practicing in low-stakes situations first, like when I'm watching a movie or TV show. It'll be a good way to build up my skills without the added pressure of a high-stakes situation.

I think I'm ready to give this a try. I'll keep you updated on how it goes with the thought records and self-compassion practice. Thanks for the tips and support, Nova.
