Therapist: Hello Naomi, it's great to see you again. I've reviewed our previous sessions, and it's clear that we've made significant progress together. I'm impressed by your dedication to practicing new techniques and developing a better understanding of yourself and your relationships.

Before we dive into today's session, I want to acknowledge and build upon the progress you've made. You've been actively working on implementing the "pause, breathe, and reframe" technique, as well as developing assertive communication skills using "I-statements." These are excellent steps towards managing stress and setting healthy boundaries.

Can you tell me, Naomi, what's been the most challenging aspect of applying these techniques in high-stress situations or difficult meetings? Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that make it harder for you to implement the strategies we've discussed?

Also, how do you feel about your progress in building a support network? Have you reached out to any friends or family members, or perhaps explored online communities that align with your interests?

Patient: Hi Nova, it's good to see you too. I appreciate the acknowledgment of my progress—it feels validating.

The most challenging aspect of applying the "pause, breathe, and reframe" technique has been during intense academic deadlines. When I'm up against a paper submission or a lab report, the pressure feels overwhelming, and I find it hard to take that moment to pause and breathe. The urgency seems to override the technique, and I end up feeling even more stressed afterward.

As for assertive communication, I've been practicing "I-statements," but I still struggle when my parents don't respect my boundaries. They often revert to using feminine pronouns, despite my clear communication about my identity. It's disheartening and makes me feel like my efforts aren't being heard or respected.

Regarding my support network, I've been more active in the LGBTQ+ community here in Berkeley. I've joined a few online forums and local meetups, which have been really helpful. It's comforting to connect with people who understand my experiences. However, I haven't reached out to my family much lately because of the ongoing tension. I'm not sure how to bridge that gap yet.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your experiences and challenges, Naomi. It's great to see that you're making progress in various areas, and I appreciate your honest reflections.

Let's break down the two areas you mentioned: applying the "pause, breathe, and reframe" technique in high-stress situations and assertive communication with your parents.

Firstly, regarding academic deadlines, it sounds like the pressure and urgency can be overwhelming. Have you thought about what might be the underlying reason for this intense pressure? Is it the fear of not meeting expectations, the desire for academic perfection, or something else? Understanding the root cause might help us develop a more effective strategy to manage these feelings.

Regarding your assertive communication with your parents, it's essential to remember that you've been clear about your identity, and it's not your responsibility to educate them about it. It's great that you've been practicing "I-statements," but it might be helpful to explore ways to reframe their behavior as not being respectful of your boundaries, rather than focusing on their lack of understanding. Perhaps we can work on a script or a phrase that helps you communicate your needs more effectively.

It's also commendable that you've been actively engaging with the LGBTQ+ community here in Berkeley. This is a great way to build a support network, and it's wonderful that you're finding comfort and understanding among like-minded individuals. However, it's understandable that you're struggling with how to bridge the gap with your family. We can explore some strategies for gradually rebuilding a connection with them, while maintaining healthy boundaries.

Let's also touch on the idea of self-compassion. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes or struggle with implementing new techniques. This is a process, and it's not about being perfect; it's about learning and growing. Can you think of a self-compassionate phrase or message that you could use when you feel like you've messed up or struggled to apply a technique? This might help you develop a more positive relationship with yourself and your abilities.

How do these thoughts resonate with you, Naomi? Is there anything in particular that you'd like to explore or work on during today's session?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. Your insights are really helpful.

Regarding the academic pressure, I think it's a mix of fear of not meeting expectations and a desire for academic perfection. I've always been the "good student," and the thought of not living up to that standard is terrifying. I also feel like I have to prove myself in this new environment, which adds to the stress.

For assertive communication with my parents, I like the idea of reframing their behavior as not respecting my boundaries. Maybe something like, "When you use feminine pronouns, it makes me feel like my identity isn't being respected." I'll try that next time.

I appreciate the reminder about self-compassion. Sometimes I get so caught up in my mistakes that I forget to be kind to myself. A self-compassionate phrase could be, "It's okay to struggle; I'm learning and growing every day."

Today, I'd like to focus on strategies for managing academic stress, especially during deadlines. I want to find a way to integrate the "pause, breathe, and reframe" technique more effectively. Do you have any specific exercises or tips for that?

Therapist: Let's work on integrating the "pause, breathe, and reframe" technique into your academic stress management plan. 

One exercise we can try is to break down the technique into even smaller, more manageable steps. For instance, when you're feeling overwhelmed by a deadline, you can pause and acknowledge the feeling, then take a few deep breaths, and finally reframe the thought by reminding yourself of your past successes or accomplishments. By breaking it down into smaller steps, you can make the technique feel less overwhelming and more achievable.

Another strategy we can explore is to use the "implementation intentions" we discussed earlier. This involves specifying when and where you will practice the technique, as well as the specific steps you will take. For example, you might say to yourself, "When I'm working on a paper at 3 pm tomorrow, I will pause for 2 minutes, breathe deeply for 5 seconds, and reframe the thought by reminding myself that I've successfully completed similar tasks before."

It's also essential to identify some "pre-game" routines that can help you prepare for academic challenges. This might include activities like meditation, exercise, or even a quick walk outside to clear your head. By establishing a consistent routine, you can signal to yourself that it's time to focus and prepare for the task at hand.

Lastly, let's not forget the importance of self-compassion in this process. Remember, it's okay to make mistakes or struggle to implement the technique. The goal is not to be perfect, but to learn and grow. I encourage you to practice self-compassion by acknowledging your efforts, even when things don't go as planned.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. Breaking down the technique into smaller steps sounds really helpful. I think I can manage that better than trying to do it all at once.

I like the idea of implementation intentions, too. I'll try to set specific times and places to practice the technique. For example, "When I'm working on my lab report at 2 pm on Thursday, I will pause for 2 minutes, breathe deeply for 5 seconds, and remind myself that I've handled similar tasks before."

As for pre-game routines, I think a quick walk outside could be really beneficial. I often feel cooped up in my apartment when I'm working on assignments, so getting some fresh air might help clear my head.

I'll also keep practicing self-compassion. It's easy to forget that it's okay to struggle, but I know it's important for my mental health.

Thank you for these strategies. I feel more confident about managing my academic stress now.
