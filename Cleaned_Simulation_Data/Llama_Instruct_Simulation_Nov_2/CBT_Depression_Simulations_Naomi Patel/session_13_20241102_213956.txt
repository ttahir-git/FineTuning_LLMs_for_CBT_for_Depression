Therapist: Welcome back, Naomi! It's great to see you again in session #13. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge the progress you've made so far. It's wonderful to see you taking steps to prioritize self-care, track your stress levels, and work on reframing your approach to challenging conversations with your mother.

To start, how have you been since our last session? Have you noticed any significant changes or developments in how you're managing stress and communicating with your mother? And which of the techniques or exercises we discussed last time have been most helpful for you so far?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's good to be back. Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to the self-care practices and stress tracking, though it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. I did notice that taking walks and cooking more vegetarian meals have helped me feel a bit more grounded. 

The communication with my mom is still tough. I tried the role-playing exercise in my head, and it helped a little, but I haven't had the courage to actually have that conversation yet. I think I'm still scared of her reaction. 

The stress tracking has been really helpful, though. I can see that my stress levels spike around midterms and when I have multiple deadlines. It's given me a clearer picture of when I need to step back and take care of myself more.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your updates with me, Naomi. It's great to hear that you've been consistent with your self-care practices and stress tracking, even if it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. Those small steps are definitely progress, and it's wonderful that you've found some comfort in activities like taking walks and cooking.

Regarding your conversation with your mom, it's completely understandable that you're still hesitant. Fear of her reaction is a natural concern, and it's okay to take your time to prepare. I'd like to explore this further. Can you tell me more about what you're most afraid of happening when you talk to your mom about your gender identity? What are the specific concerns that are holding you back?

Patient: I think what I'm most afraid of is that she won't understand and that it will create a bigger rift between us. I'm worried she'll react with disappointment or sadness, and that it will make her feel like she's lost a daughter. I'm also scared that she'll use the wrong pronouns again, which would be really hurtful. 

The specific concerns holding me back are that I don't want to upset her, and I'm not sure how to explain it in a way that she'll really get it. I want her to see me as I am, but I'm afraid she'll only see it as a rejection of our culture and traditions.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your fears and concerns with me, Naomi. It's completely normal to worry about how someone we love will react to a difficult conversation. It sounds like you're afraid of being misunderstood, and that the conversation will lead to a rift between you and your mom.

Let's break down some of these concerns together. First, you mentioned that you're worried about your mom feeling disappointed or sad. Have you considered that her reaction might actually be a sign of love and concern, rather than rejection? That she might be struggling to understand, but ultimately wants what's best for you?

Regarding your mom's use of the wrong pronouns, I want to acknowledge that it can be hurtful. However, it might also be a sign that she's not yet aware of how her actions affect you. Would you be open to discussing with me some possible ways to explain how it impacts you, so that you feel more prepared for that conversation?

As for explaining your gender identity to your mom, it's great that you want to help her understand. Have you thought about how you could approach this conversation in a way that feels safe and authentic for you? Maybe we can brainstorm some strategies together to make this conversation feel less daunting.

Lastly, you mentioned that you're worried about your mom seeing your identity as a rejection of your culture and traditions. Can we explore this concern further? What do you think it would mean if your mom were to understand and accept your identity? How would that make you feel?

Let's take a step back and look at these concerns from a different perspective. What if, instead of being a source of fear, this conversation could be an opportunity for growth and understanding between you and your mom?

Patient: I appreciate you breaking it down like that, Nova. It does help to think about her reaction as a sign of love and concern rather than rejection. I guess I hadn't considered that she might be struggling to understand because she cares about me.

I'm definitely open to discussing ways to explain how her use of the wrong pronouns impacts me. It's been really hurtful, and I want her to understand that it's not just a small mistake but something that affects my sense of self.

For approaching the conversation, I think it would feel safer if I could start by sharing some resources or articles that explain non-binary identities in a way that might resonate with her. I also want to emphasize that my identity isn't about rejecting our culture but about embracing who I truly am.

If she were to understand and accept my identity, I think it would make me feel more seen and validated. It would mean a lot to have her support, even if it takes time for her to fully grasp it.

Thinking about this conversation as an opportunity for growth and understanding is a good perspective shift. It makes it feel less like a confrontation and more like a chance to build a deeper connection with her.

Therapist: Naomi, it sounds like you've had some valuable insights and reflections during our conversation today. It takes a lot of courage to consider your mom's perspective and to think about how you can approach this conversation in a way that feels safe and authentic for you.

I love the idea of sharing resources or articles with your mom to help her understand non-binary identities. That could be a great way to start the conversation and provide her with a foundation for understanding. And I'm glad you emphasized that your identity is not about rejecting your culture, but about embracing who you truly are. That's an important distinction to make.

It's also wonderful that you're thinking about what this conversation could mean for your relationship with your mom. If she were to understand and accept your identity, it would likely be a significant step forward in your relationship. It's great that you're focusing on the potential for growth and understanding, rather than just the fear of rejection or conflict.

As we move forward, I want to encourage you to continue exploring these ideas and feelings. It might be helpful to brainstorm some more specific strategies for approaching the conversation with your mom. What are some things you could say or do to make the conversation feel safer and more productive?

Also, I want to check in with you about your stress levels and self-care practices. How have you been feeling lately, and are there any new challenges or stressors that have come up? We can also discuss some additional strategies for managing stress and taking care of yourself, especially during this time.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to take your time with this conversation. You don't have to rush into it or force a particular outcome. Remember that you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Let's take a moment to pause and reflect on all the progress you've made so far.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the encouragement and the reminder that it's okay to take my time with this. 

For the conversation with my mom, I think I could start by asking her if we could have a calm, private talk when she's not stressed or busy. I could also prepare some points to share, like how my identity makes me feel more authentic and how it's not about rejecting our culture but embracing who I am. Maybe I could even suggest we watch a documentary or read an article together to start the conversation.

As for my stress levels, they've been pretty high lately. I had a big project deadline last week, and it was really overwhelming. I did manage to take some walks and cook more, which helped a bit, but I still felt pretty drained. I've also noticed that I've been avoiding some of my academic work because I'm scared of not doing well.

I think some additional strategies for managing stress could be really helpful. Maybe we could talk about some specific techniques or exercises that I can try when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I'm open to anything that might help me feel more in control and less anxious.

Therapist: It sounds like you've been making progress in many areas, Naomi. I'm proud of you for taking the time to reflect on your feelings and concerns, and for thinking about how you can approach the conversation with your mom in a way that feels safe and authentic for you.

Let's start with the conversation with your mom. I love the ideas you mentioned, such as asking her for a calm, private talk, preparing some points to share, and suggesting you watch a documentary or read an article together. Those are all great ways to start the conversation and create a safe space for her to learn and grow.

Now, let's talk about your stress levels. It's not uncommon to feel overwhelmed when facing a big project deadline, and it's even more impressive that you were able to take some walks and cook more, even when you were feeling drained. That shows a lot of resilience and self-care.

In terms of specific techniques or exercises that might help you manage stress, I want to suggest a few ideas. Have you considered trying some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization? These can be really helpful in reducing stress and anxiety in the moment.

Another idea might be to break down your academic work into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can help make it feel less overwhelming and more achievable. And, of course, we can continue to work on your stress tracking and self-care practices to make sure you're taking care of yourself during this time.

Finally, I want to acknowledge that avoiding academic work because of fear of not doing well is a common pattern. Let's explore this further. What does this avoidance look like for you? Is it a physical avoidance, such as not opening your books or not starting your assignments? Or is it more of an emotional avoidance, such as feeling anxious or uncertain about how to approach your work?

Let's work on identifying some patterns and strategies that might help you overcome this avoidance. I'm here to support you, and I want to make sure you feel confident and equipped to manage your stress and anxiety.

Shall we continue with this exploration of your stress and avoidance patterns, or would you like to move on to something else?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the suggestions for relaxation techniques and breaking down tasks. I think those could really help me manage my stress better.

For the avoidance, it's more of an emotional avoidance. I feel anxious and uncertain about how to approach my work, especially when I think about how much I need to do and how high the expectations are. It's like I get paralyzed by the thought of not doing well, and then I just end up procrastinating or doing something else to distract myself.

I think continuing to explore this avoidance pattern would be really helpful. I want to find ways to overcome it and feel more confident in my academic work. Maybe we could talk about some strategies to help me tackle my assignments head-on and build my confidence in my abilities.

Therapist: It sounds like we've made some great progress today, Naomi. I'm glad you found the suggestions for relaxation techniques and breaking down tasks helpful. It's a great start, and I'm here to support you as you continue to work on managing your stress and anxiety.

Regarding your avoidance pattern, it's great that you're aware of how you're feeling and what's causing you to procrastinate. Emotional avoidance can be a challenging pattern to break, but with the right strategies and support, I'm confident that you can overcome it.

To start, let's explore some specific strategies that might help you tackle your assignments head-on and build your confidence in your abilities. Have you considered using a " Pomodoro timer" to break down your work into smaller, manageable chunks? You could work in focused 25-minute increments, followed by a 5-minute break. This can help you stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed.

Another idea might be to reframe your thinking around your academic work. Instead of focusing on the fear of not doing well, let's try to focus on the things you're doing well. What are some areas where you excel, and how can you build on those strengths? We can work on identifying some specific accomplishments and successes, and using those as motivation to tackle your challenges.

It's also worth exploring some cognitive-behavioral techniques, such as cognitive restructuring or thought records, to help you challenge negative self-talk and build more positive self-talk. This can be a powerful way to change your mindset and build confidence in your abilities.

Let's also talk about the concept of "self-compassion" - being kind and understanding with yourself, even when you make mistakes or struggle with challenges. Can you think of a time when you were kind to someone else who was struggling, but not as kind to yourself? How can you practice more self-compassion in your daily life, especially when faced with challenges and setbacks?

Lastly, I want to check in with you about your goals and aspirations. What are some things you want to achieve in the coming weeks or months? How do you see your academic and personal goals aligning, and what steps can you take to move forward?

Let's explore these ideas further and develop a plan to help you build confidence in your academic abilities and overcome your avoidance pattern. How does that sound?

Patient: That sounds really helpful, Nova. I think using a Pomodoro timer could be a good way to break down my work and stay focused without feeling overwhelmed. I've tried it before, but I didn't stick with it, so maybe we could talk about how to make it a more consistent habit.

Reframing my thinking around my academic work is something I definitely need to work on. I often focus on what I'm not doing well instead of what I am. I think identifying my strengths and accomplishments could really help build my confidence. For example, I'm really good at data analysis and have received positive feedback on my research methods.

I like the idea of cognitive-behavioral techniques like cognitive restructuring. I think my negative self-talk is a big part of why I feel so anxious about my work. I often tell myself that I'm not good enough or that I'll fail, which makes it hard to get started.

Practicing self-compassion is something I struggle with a lot. I tend to be really hard on myself when I make mistakes or don't meet my own expectations. I can definitely think of times when I've been kind to others but not to myself. I think making a conscious effort to treat myself with the same kindness and understanding that I offer to others could be really beneficial.

As for my goals, I want to improve my academic performance and feel more confident in my abilities

Therapist: It sounds like we've made some great progress today, Naomi! I'm glad you found the suggestions helpful and that you're willing to work on building your confidence and overcoming your avoidance pattern.

Let's start with the Pomodoro timer. We can definitely work on making it a consistent habit. One idea might be to create a schedule for yourself that includes regular Pomodoro sessions, perhaps with a specific time of day or week that you dedicate to focused work. We can also talk about ways to make the breaks more effective, such as using them to do something enjoyable or relaxing.

Reframing your thinking around your academic work is a great idea. Let's work on identifying your strengths and accomplishments, and using those as motivation to tackle your challenges. We can also explore some specific cognitive-behavioral techniques, such as thought records or cognitive restructuring, to help you challenge negative self-talk and build more positive self-talk.

Practicing self-compassion is a wonderful goal to work towards. We can explore some strategies for being kinder to yourself, such as writing yourself a kindness letter or practicing mindfulness. Remember, self-compassion is not about being self-indulgent, but about being gentle and understanding with yourself, just as you would with a good friend.

Finally, let's talk about your goals and aspirations. Improving your academic performance and feeling more confident in your abilities is a great starting point. We can work on breaking down these goals into smaller, more manageable steps, and developing a plan to achieve them.

To summarize, our homework for next session will be to:

1. Start using the Pomodoro timer consistently, and track your progress.
2. Identify your strengths and accomplishments, and use those as motivation to tackle your challenges.
3. Practice self-compassion by being kinder to yourself, and using mindfulness techniques to stay present.
4. Work on reframing your thinking around your academic work, using cognitive-behavioral techniques to challenge negative self-talk.

How does that sound? Do you have any questions or concerns before we wrap up this session?

Patient: That sounds like a solid plan, Nova. I'm ready to give it a try and see how it goes. I think tracking my progress with the Pomodoro timer will be really helpful, and I'm excited to start identifying my strengths and accomplishments to build my confidence.

I do have a question about the self-compassion practice. How do I start writing a kindness letter to myself? I've never done that before, and I'm not sure where to begin. Could you give me an example or some tips on how to approach it?

Other than that, I think we're good for now. I'm looking forward to seeing how these strategies help me in the coming weeks. Thanks for all your support, Nova.
