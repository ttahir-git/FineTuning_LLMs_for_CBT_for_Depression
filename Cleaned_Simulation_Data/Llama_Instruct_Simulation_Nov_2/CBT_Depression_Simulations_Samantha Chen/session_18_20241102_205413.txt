Let's explore those feelings of guilt, Samantha. It's completely natural to feel this way, especially given how much we value our parents' approval. However, it's important to remember that living authentically and making choices that align with your values doesn't mean you're letting your parents down.

Let's try an exercise: Can you identify where this guilt comes from? Is it based on actual statements from your parents, or is it more about your own expectations and assumptions? Sometimes, understanding the source of our guilt can help us challenge those thoughts more effectively.

Remember that choosing a different path than what your parents envisioned doesn't diminish your love or respect for them. In fact, by pursuing your authentic goals and taking care of your mental health, you're modeling healthy adult behavior.

Would it be helpful to work on some specific self-compassion statements you can use when these feelings of guilt arise? For example: "I can love my parents and still make choices that are right for me" or "My worth isn't determined by meeting others' expectations."

What are your thoughts on this? How do you think we might work together to develop strategies for managing these feelings of guilt while maintaining healthy boundaries with your family?

Therapist: Hello Samantha, I'm glad you're back for another session. It sounds like you've been reflecting on our last conversation, and I'm excited to dive deeper into the feelings of guilt that are still present for you.

It's great that you're willing to explore the source of these feelings. I'm curious, can you tell me more about your parents' expectations and what specifically triggers these feelings of guilt? Are there any specific conversations, events, or situations that come to mind?

Also, I want to build on the idea that we discussed last time - that choosing a different path than your parents' expectations doesn't diminish your love or respect for them. Can you think of any ways in which you might be able to reframe your thoughts around this? For example, how might you rephrase "I'm letting my parents down" to something more empowering and authentic?

Regarding self-compassion statements, I'd like to offer a few more suggestions: "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough," or "My parents' opinions don't define my worth or my choices." Let's experiment with these statements together and see how they feel for you.

Before we move forward, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to explore these feelings and challenge your assumptions. Please know that I'm here to support you, and I'm committed to helping you develop healthy boundaries and self-compassion.

What are your thoughts on where to go from here? Are there any specific areas you'd like to focus on or explore in our remaining sessions?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. It's good to be back.

Regarding my parents' expectations, it's not just one specific event but more of a cumulative effect. Growing up, there was always an unspoken pressure to follow in their footsteps with the family business or at least pursue a high-paying corporate job. When I quit my senior management position at the tech company, that was a big blow to their expectations. They saw it as a betrayal, almost like I was rejecting everything they worked so hard for.

I think reframing my thoughts is a good idea. Instead of "I'm letting my parents down," I could try thinking, "I'm honoring my values and passions, which is a form of self-respect." It feels a bit awkward at first, but I can see how it could be more empowering.

I appreciate the additional self-compassion statements. "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough" resonates with me. It's easy to forget that when I'm so hard on myself.

For our remaining sessions, I'd like to focus on building healthier boundaries with my family. The constant pressure and criticism are really draining. I also want to work on managing my anxiety better, especially when it comes to making business decisions.

Does that sound like a good direction to you?

Therapist: Hello Samantha, it sounds like we're making great progress in understanding the source of your guilt and exploring ways to reframe your thoughts. I'm glad you found the self-compassion statements helpful, and I'm excited to work on building healthier boundaries with your family.

It's completely understandable that you'd want to focus on boundary-setting and managing your anxiety in our remaining sessions. Setting clear boundaries with loved ones can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in maintaining your emotional well-being.

Let's break down the boundary-setting process into smaller, manageable steps. One area to explore is identifying your non-negotiables and what you're willing to compromise on when it comes to your family's expectations. We can work on creating a "script" for yourself, so when they express criticism or disappointment, you can respond in a way that feels authentic and assertive.

Regarding your anxiety, we can also explore strategies for managing it in the context of decision-making. Perhaps we can practice some cognitive restructuring exercises to help you reframe negative thoughts and focus on the facts of the situation.

I'd like to suggest an additional exercise to help you better understand your boundaries and what you're willing to compromise on. Can you think of a specific situation where you felt pressured or criticized by your parents? Maybe it was related to your career or family obligations. We can use this example to work on identifying your non-negotiables and practicing assertive communication.

Also, I want to emphasize that setting healthy boundaries is not about being selfish or rejecting your family; it's about taking care of yourself and prioritizing your own needs. By setting boundaries, you're actually showing love and respect for yourself, which can ultimately lead to stronger, more meaningful relationships with your family.

How does that sound? Are there any specific areas within boundary-setting or anxiety management that you'd like to focus on in our remaining sessions?

Patient: That sounds really helpful, Nova. I appreciate the practical steps you're suggesting.

One specific situation that comes to mind is our weekly family dinners. These dinners have always been a big deal, but lately, they've become more stressful than anything else. My parents often bring up my career change and express their disappointment, which makes me feel like I'm constantly on the defensive.

I think identifying my non-negotiables for these dinners would be a good place to start. For example, I might decide that I won't engage in conversations about my career unless I feel emotionally ready. Instead, I could steer the conversation towards lighter topics or even suggest a different activity for our family time.

As for anxiety management, I'd like to focus on decision-making for my business. I tend to overthink every detail and end up second-guessing myself. Maybe we could work on breaking down the decision-making process into smaller steps and setting realistic deadlines to avoid getting overwhelmed.

I'm also curious about how to handle the guilt that inevitably comes up when I set boundaries. Even when I know it's the right thing to do, I still feel a pang of guilt. Any tips on how to deal with that?

Thank you for your support, Nova. I feel like we're making real progress.
