Therapist: Welcome back, Samantha! It's great to see you for our 21st session. I'm glad we could summarize the key points from our previous session. Before we dive in, how did you find the homework tasks and exercises we practiced last time? Did you have any successes or challenges in incorporating them into your daily life?

Also, what are your thoughts and feelings about your career decisions and family dynamics at this point? Are there any new insights or concerns that have emerged since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for having me back. I did try the breathing exercises and muscle relaxation techniques, and they helped a bit with the anxiety, especially when I felt overwhelmed by work. However, I still find it hard to stick to them consistently. 

As for the assertive communication with my family, it's been a mixed bag. I tried using "I" statements, and it did help reduce some of the tension during our last family dinner. But my parents still don't fully understand why I left my corporate job, and they keep bringing it up, which is frustrating.

In terms of my career decisions, I'm still passionate about GreenThread, but the financial stress is really weighing on me. I had to take out another loan last week, and it's making me question if I made the right choice. My partner, Michael, is supportive, but even he's starting to show some concern about our financial future.

I guess what's new is that I've been feeling a bit more isolated lately. I haven't been reaching out to friends as much, and I skipped my book club again. I know it's partly because of the business stress, but it's also making me feel even more anxious and disconnected.

Therapist: Samantha, it sounds like you're making progress with the relaxation techniques, but it's not yet consistent enough to provide lasting relief. That's completely okay, as developing new habits takes time and practice. Let's focus on making these techniques more accessible and enjoyable for you.

Regarding assertive communication, it's great that using "I" statements helped reduce tension during the family dinner. However, it's also clear that your parents still don't fully understand your career choices, and that's causing frustration. We can work on refining your communication strategies to better address their concerns and concerns.

The financial stress is definitely a significant challenge, and taking out another loan can be overwhelming. Let's explore some coping mechanisms and strategies to manage these feelings of uncertainty. Your partner, Michael, being supportive, but also expressing concern, might be a double-edged sword. We can discuss ways to communicate with Michael about your fears and concerns, as well as find ways to manage his worries.

Lastly, feeling isolated and disconnected is a new concern. It's not uncommon for entrepreneurs and individuals facing significant changes to withdraw from social connections. Let's explore ways to reconnect with friends and activities that bring you joy, while also acknowledging that it's okay to take time for yourself during this challenging period.

Before we dive deeper into these topics, I want to acknowledge that you've been open and honest about your struggles. That takes a lot of courage, and I appreciate your willingness to share your thoughts and feelings. Now, let's work together to find ways to address these challenges and move forward.

Can you tell me, what are some small, manageable steps you'd like to take this week to address any of these concerns? What would you like to focus on first?

Patient: Thanks for acknowledging my struggles, Nova. It does take a lot of courage to be this open, and it helps to know you're here to support me.

For this week, I think I'd like to focus on making the relaxation techniques more consistent. Maybe if I set a specific time each day to practice them, it could help. I'm thinking of trying the breathing exercises right after I wake up, since that's when my anxiety tends to spike.

As for assertive communication with my parents, I could use some help refining my approach. I want to be able to explain my career choices in a way that resonates with them, without feeling like I'm justifying myself. Do you have any specific strategies or examples I could use?

Lastly, I know I need to work on reconnecting with friends. I've been meaning to reach out to my book club friends, but I keep putting it off. Maybe if I set a small goal, like sending a text to one friend each day, it could help me start rebuilding those connections.

Those are the steps I'd like to focus on this week. What do you think?

Therapist: Samantha, I think those are excellent goals for this week. Let's break them down further to make them even more manageable.

For the relaxation techniques, setting a specific time each day to practice them, like right after waking up, is a great idea. You might also consider setting a reminder on your phone or putting a note on your mirror to help you remember to practice. Consistency is key, and even a few minutes of relaxation each day can make a big difference.

Regarding assertive communication with your parents, let's work on crafting a clear and respectful message that explains your career choices in a way that resonates with them. One strategy we can use is called the "3-Part Assertion." It involves:

1. Stating your feeling or opinion: "I feel frustrated when..."
2. Expressed your needs: "I need you to understand..."
3. Specify what you want: "I would appreciate it if..."

For example, you could say: "I feel frustrated when we discuss my career choices, Mom and Dad. I need you to understand that my decision to leave my corporate job is because I'm passionate about sustainable fashion and want to make a positive impact on the environment. I would appreciate it if we could focus on supporting my business goals, rather than worrying about financial stability."

As for reconnecting with friends, sending a text to one friend each day is a great starting point. You might also consider scheduling a regular check-in, like a weekly coffee date or a monthly book club meeting, to help you stay connected with your social network.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge that you're taking small steps towards addressing your concerns, and that's a huge accomplishment. Remember, progress is not always linear, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.

Before we wrap up this session, I want to leave you with a homework assignment. Take a few minutes each day to practice self-compassion by writing down three things you're doing well, three things you're grateful for, and three things you're looking forward to. This can help you cultivate a more positive and compassionate mindset, which can be really helpful during this challenging time.

What do you think about this homework assignment?

Patient: That homework assignment sounds really helpful, Nova. I think it's a good way to remind myself of the positive things, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed.

I'll definitely try the 3-Part Assertion with my parents. It sounds like a clear and respectful way to communicate my feelings and needs. I'll practice it a few times before our next family dinner.

Setting reminders for the relaxation techniques and scheduling regular check-ins with friends are also great ideas. I'll start with those right away.

Thanks for breaking everything down and making it more manageable. I feel a bit more hopeful about tackling these challenges this week.
