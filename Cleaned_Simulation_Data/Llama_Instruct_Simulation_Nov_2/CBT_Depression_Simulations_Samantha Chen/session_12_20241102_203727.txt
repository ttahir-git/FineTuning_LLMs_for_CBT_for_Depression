Therapist: Welcome back, Samantha! I'm glad to see you're making progress in our sessions. It sounds like you've been practicing the "Three Perspectives" technique, which is fantastic. Breaking down situations into the three perspectives - your current perspective, a friend's perspective, and your future perspective - has been helpful in gaining a more balanced view.

It's great to hear that you've been recognizing progress in your relationship with Michael. Building a stronger, more compassionate relationship with yourself and others is a key part of our CBT work together.

I'd like to discuss some of the challenges you've been facing, especially with your parents. How have you been feeling about those relationship challenges lately? Have you noticed any shifts or changes in how you approach them since our last session?

Patient: Thanks for the welcome. I have been trying to use the "Three Perspectives" technique, but it's still a bit tricky for me. Sometimes I get stuck in my own harsh perspective and it's hard to shift to the other two. I do see how it could be helpful, though.

As for my parents, it's been a mixed bag. I've been trying to approach our conversations with more patience and compassion, like we talked about. But it's really hard when they keep pushing their views on me, especially about my career change. I feel like they just don't understand, and it makes me defensive. I haven't noticed a huge shift yet, but I'm trying to be more mindful of my reactions.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making a good effort to practice the "Three Perspectives" technique, even if it's still a bit challenging for you. That's completely normal - it takes time and practice to develop new skills and ways of thinking. The fact that you can see how it could be helpful is a great start.

Regarding your relationships with your parents, it's understandable that it's still a tough spot for you. It's amazing that you're trying to approach conversations with more patience and compassion, but it's also normal to feel defensive when you feel like your views aren't being heard.

Let's take a closer look at this. When you feel defensive, what's going through your mind? Is there a specific thought or phrase that you find yourself repeating to yourself in those moments? We can use the "Three Perspectives" technique to explore this further. Can you describe what you typically think or say to yourself when your parents are pushing their views on you?

Patient: When I feel defensive with my parents, I usually think things like, "They just don't get it," or "Why can't they see how much this means to me?" It's like I'm constantly trying to justify my decisions, and it feels exhausting. I also find myself thinking, "They're never going to accept this," which makes me feel hopeless. It's hard to stay calm when those thoughts start swirling in my head.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing this, Samantha. It sounds like you're experiencing some common thoughts that can get in the way of calm and rational thinking. Those thoughts, such as "They just don't get it" and "They're never going to accept this," can be quite distressing and create a sense of hopelessness.

Let's break these down using the "Three Perspectives" technique. Can you imagine what a friend might say to you in this situation? What advice or reassurance might they offer? We can use this as a way to challenge those harsh thoughts and gain a more balanced view.

Additionally, let's explore your future perspective. What do you hope to achieve in your relationship with your parents? What kind of interactions do you want to have with them? By imagining a positive future, we can work on shifting your focus away from the negative thoughts and towards more empowering and constructive ways of thinking.

Lastly, let's take a closer look at your current perspective. What's driving that sense of defensiveness? Is it fear, insecurity, or something else? By understanding what's driving your thoughts and feelings, we can begin to develop more effective strategies to manage them.

Shall we try a small exercise to apply the "Three Perspectives" technique to this specific situation? We can use a visualization technique to help you tap into each of the three perspectives. Are you up for that?

Patient: Sure, I'm willing to try the visualization exercise. I think it might help to see things from a different angle. So, for the friend's perspective, I imagine a close friend might say something like, "They're just worried about you, but they'll come around eventually. You're doing something you're passionate about, and that's important."

For the future perspective, I hope to have a relationship where we can have open, respectful conversations without so much tension. I want them to see that I'm happy and successful in my own way, even if it's different from what they expected.

As for my current perspective, I think the defensiveness comes from a mix of fear and insecurity. I'm afraid of disappointing them and not living up to their expectations, and that insecurity makes it hard to stay calm and rational.

Let's go ahead with the visualization exercise. I'm ready.

Therapist: Excellent work, Samantha! I'm so proud of you for taking the initiative to practice the "Three Perspectives" technique, even if it's still a bit challenging. And wow, you're really taking a deep dive into your thoughts and emotions around your relationship with your parents.

Let's begin the visualization exercise. Please find a comfortable seated position, close your eyes, and take a few deep breaths. Imagine yourself in a calm, peaceful environment, where you feel safe and relaxed.

Now, let's start with the friend's perspective. Imagine a close friend, someone who cares about you deeply, sitting across from you in a calm and understanding space. They're offering you words of encouragement and support. As you breathe in, imagine their words filling you up with confidence and reassurance. What are some phrases or words you imagine your friend saying to you?

(pause for Samantha to visualize)

Great job! Now, let's move on to your future perspective. Imagine yourself in a few years from now, when you've successfully navigated this career change and built a fulfilling life that aligns with your passions. You're sitting in a comfortable, serene space, feeling proud and content. Imagine the conversations you'll have with your parents in the future, where you can express yourself openly and honestly. What kind of interactions do you imagine having with them? How do you see them responding to your success?

(pause for Samantha to visualize)

Excellent work again! Now, let's take a closer look at your current perspective. As you explore your current thoughts and feelings, I'd like you to notice the physical sensations in your body. What do you feel in your chest, your shoulders, or your stomach? Are there any specific emotions or thoughts that arise when you think about your parents' concerns?

As we continue to explore your current perspective, I'd like you to imagine that you're holding a small, delicate flower in your hands. This flower represents your emotions and thoughts in this moment. As we examine it, I want you to notice its texture, its color, and its fragrance. What do you notice about this flower?

(continued conversation).

Patient: Thank you for your feedback. I appreciate the encouragement. While visualizing the friend's perspective, I imagined my best friend, Emily, offering soft, comforting words. She'd remind me that I'm doing my best and that my parents love me despite their concerns. Her presence felt reassuring. 

For the future perspective, I imagined myself in a comfortable studio filled with my GreenThread designs. I saw myself having a calm, respectful conversation with my parents where I could explain my business's growth and positive impact. They seemed more accepting, expressing pride in my hard work. It felt hopeful.

In my current perspective, I felt a knot in my chest and tightness in my shoulders when thinking about my parents' concerns. The flower I imagined was a delicate, pale lavender. Its petals felt soft but slightly wilted, reflecting my current stress and anxiety. The fragrance was faint, almost imperceptible, like the hope I feel despite the challenges.

Therapist: Samantha, I'm so proud of you for taking the time to reflect on your thoughts and emotions. It's wonderful that you were able to tap into the friend's perspective with Emily's comforting words and reassuring presence.

It's also beautiful that you visualized a future where you have a calm and respectful conversation with your parents, where they express pride in your hard work and accept your decisions. That's a great example of reframing your thoughts and imagining a positive outcome.

Now, let's focus on your current perspective. The image of the pale lavender flower is a great representation of your emotions in this moment. The wilted petals may indicate that you're feeling drained or exhausted from the stress and anxiety. But I want to draw your attention to the faint fragrance of the flower. That suggests that even in the midst of difficulty, there's still a glimmer of hope.

As we continue to explore your current perspective, I'd like to introduce an exercise that might help you cultivate more compassion and understanding towards yourself. This exercise is called "Self-Kindness Reflection."

Can you imagine that you're sitting with your own self, as you would with a close friend, in a comfortable and non-judgmental space? As you sit together, what kind of words or phrases would you offer yourself in this moment? What kind of kindness and understanding would you extend to yourself, given the challenges you're facing?

Remember, we're not trying to dismiss your emotions or avoid the difficulties, but rather to develop a greater sense of compassion and understanding towards yourself. What would you say to yourself in this moment, Samantha?

(continued conversation).

Patient: Thank you for the kind words and for guiding me through this exercise. It's been helpful to visualize these different perspectives. 

For the "Self-Kindness Reflection," I imagine sitting with myself in a cozy, quiet room. I'd offer myself words of encouragement, like, "You're doing your best, and that's enough." I'd remind myself that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that taking small steps forward is still progress. I'd also acknowledge the courage it takes to pursue my passion and start GreenThread, despite the challenges. It's important to give myself credit for that.
