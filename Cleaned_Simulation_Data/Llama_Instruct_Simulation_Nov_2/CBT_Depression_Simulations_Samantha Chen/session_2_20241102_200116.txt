Therapist: Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session, Samantha. I'm glad to hear that you found the session helpful and that you're feeling more hopeful about your journey. Let's start with where you left off. How have you been since our last session? Have you made any progress on your homework assignments or noticed any changes in your thoughts or behaviors?

Also, I noticed that we didn't explicitly discuss your relationship with your parents in this summary. I want to make sure we prioritize that in our next sessions. How have you been thinking about addressing those issues, and what are some specific concerns or goals you'd like to work on in this area?

Lastly, I'd like to check in on your scale rating for the probability of worst-case scenarios. Have you had any particularly challenging moments where you felt anxious or overwhelmed, and if so, how did you cope with those feelings?

Patient: Since our last session, I've been trying to stay focused on the present moment, especially when I start to feel overwhelmed by future worries. I've been practicing thought reframing, but it's still a work in progress. Sometimes, I catch myself falling back into that all-or-nothing thinking, especially when it comes to my business. For example, if I make a small mistake in a design, I start to panic that the whole line will fail. But then I remind myself that it's just one small part, and I can fix it.

As for my relationship with my parents, it's been tense. I haven't made much progress in addressing it directly. I've been avoiding family dinners because I know the conversations will just turn into arguments. I guess my main goal would be to find a way to communicate with them without feeling like I'm disappointing them or being judged. I want to be able to share my successes and struggles without feeling guilty.

Regarding the scale rating for worst-case scenarios, I had a particularly challenging moment last week when I received a negative review from a potential investor. I felt like the whole world was crashing down on me. I tried to cope by journaling, but I ended up binge-eating that night. It's frustrating because I know it's not a healthy coping mechanism, but in the moment, it felt like the only way to calm down.

Therapist: Samantha, thank you for sharing your progress and challenges since our last session. I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing thought reframing and trying to stay present, but it's also great that you're acknowledging areas where you're struggling.

Firstly, let's break down that all-or-nothing thinking pattern you mentioned. It sounds like when you make a small mistake, your mind immediately jumps to the worst-case scenario that the whole line will fail. Can you try to identify the cognitive distortion that's happening here? Is it catastrophizing, or something else?

Also, I want to acknowledge that your decision to avoid family dinners might be a coping mechanism in itself. While it might be providing temporary relief, it might also be preventing you from addressing the underlying issues with your parents. Are you willing to explore some strategies for communicating with them in a way that feels less threatening to you?

Regarding the negative review from the potential investor, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed by that. It sounds like you tried to cope with journaling, but ended up turning to binge-eating instead. Can you tell me more about what was happening in that moment? What thoughts were you having, and what emotions were you feeling?

Lastly, I want to remind you that developing a business is a journey with ups and downs, and it's normal to encounter setbacks. But what's important is how we respond to those setbacks. Can we work on reframing your thoughts to focus on solutions rather than catastrophizing? For example, instead of thinking "the whole line will fail," what if you thought "I made a mistake, but I can fix it and learn from it"?

Patient: You're right, that all-or-nothing thinking is definitely a form of catastrophizing. When I make a small mistake, my mind immediately goes to the worst possible outcome. It's like I can't see any middle ground. I know it's not rational, but it feels so real in the moment.

Avoiding family dinners is definitely a coping mechanism. I guess I'm just so afraid of their judgment and criticism that I avoid the situation altogether. I'm willing to explore strategies, but I'm not sure where to start. Maybe we could role-play some scenarios or come up with specific phrases I could use to communicate better?

When I received that negative review, I felt a mix of emotionsâ€”anger, frustration, and a deep sense of failure. My thoughts were racing, thinking that if one investor didn't like my proposal, then no one would. It was overwhelming, and I felt like I had no control over the situation. Journaling helped a bit, but it wasn't enough to calm me down.

I understand that setbacks are part of the journey, but it's hard to keep that perspective when you're in the middle of it. I like the idea of reframing my thoughts to focus on solutions. Maybe instead of thinking "the whole line will fail," I could remind myself that it's just one review and there are other investors out there. It'

Therapist: Let's break down the progress you've made and the areas where you're struggling.

Firstly, it's great that you've identified the all-or-nothing thinking pattern as catastrophizing. Recognizing the cognitive distortion is a huge step forward. Now, let's work on reframing those thoughts to be more balanced and realistic.

Can you try to come up with a more realistic and flexible thought pattern when you make a small mistake? For example, instead of thinking "the whole line will fail," what if you thought "I made a mistake, but it's not the end of the world. I can learn from it and fix it."?

Regarding your relationship with your parents, I'm glad you're willing to explore strategies for communicating with them. Avoiding family dinners might be providing temporary relief, but it's not addressing the underlying issues. Let's work on building some communication skills that will help you feel more confident and less judged.

One strategy we can try is role-playing different scenarios. We can practice responding to specific comments or concerns from your parents in a way that feels more assertive and less defensive.

Lastly, regarding the negative review from the investor, it's great that you acknowledged the mix of emotions you felt. It sounds like your thoughts were racing, and you felt overwhelmed. However, it's also great that you tried journaling as a coping mechanism.

Let's work on developing a more effective coping strategy for when you're feeling overwhelmed. We can brainstorm some alternative strategies that might help you manage those feelings better, such as taking a short break, calling a friend, or engaging in a relaxing activity.

Before we move forward, I want to check in with you on one thing. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that might be contributing to your all-or-nothing thinking or catastrophizing? For example, do you tend to feel more anxious or overwhelmed in certain situations or when certain people are around?

Patient: Yes, I've noticed that I tend to catastrophize more when I'm under a lot of pressure or when I'm around people who I feel are judging me. For example, when I'm working on a tight deadline or when I'm around my parents, I feel like I have to be perfect, and any mistake feels like a failure.

I like the idea of reframing my thoughts when I make a small mistake. Instead of thinking "the whole line will fail," I can remind myself that it's just one mistake and I can learn from it. It's a more balanced perspective.

Role-playing different scenarios with my parents sounds helpful. I think it would give me more confidence in how to respond to their comments without feeling defensive.

As for coping strategies, I've been trying to take short breaks when I feel overwhelmed, but sometimes it's hard to step away from work. I'll try to be more consistent with that and maybe call a friend or engage in a relaxing activity like yoga when I need to calm down.

I'm also trying to identify triggers for my all-or-nothing thinking. I think it's mostly related to feeling judged or under pressure, so I'll work on recognizing those situations and practicing more balanced thinking in those moments.

Therapist: It sounds like we've made some great progress, Samantha. You're recognizing the patterns and triggers that contribute to your all-or-nothing thinking, and you're working on reframing your thoughts to be more balanced and realistic.

Let's focus on building on that. Can you think of one specific situation where you tend to catastrophize, and we can role-play it together? For example, what if we were to imagine a scenario where your parents are commenting on your business, and you start to feel like you need to be perfect? How would you like to respond in that situation?

Also, I want to build on the idea of taking short breaks when you feel overwhelmed. What if we could create a "reset" button for you, a simple activity that you can do when you feel like you're about to catastrophize? This could be something as simple as taking three deep breaths, going for a short walk, or doing a quick meditation exercise. What do you think?

Lastly, I want to remind you that you're making progress, Samantha. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to make mistakes. You're learning and growing, and that's what's most important.

Before we move forward, I want to assign you some homework. Can you commit to practicing thought reframing in at least three situations this week where you tend to catastrophize? Can you also try to identify one specific trigger that contributes to your all-or-nothing thinking, and work on finding a way to cope with it in a more balanced way?

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and we can discuss them further.

Patient: Sure, let's role-play a scenario with my parents. Imagine we're at a family dinner, and my mom starts asking about how the business is going. She starts to question my decisions, and I start feeling like I need to justify everything and prove that I'm not making a mistake. How would I respond in that situation?

For the "reset" button, I think taking three deep breaths sounds simple and effective. I can definitely do that when I feel like I'm about to catastrophize. It might help me calm down and think more clearly.

I'll commit to practicing thought reframing in at least three situations this week. One specific trigger that contributes to my all-or-nothing thinking is when I'm under a tight deadline. I tend to feel like everything has to be perfect, or else it's a failure. I'll work on finding a more balanced way to cope with that pressure, maybe by setting smaller, achievable goals within the deadline.

I don't have any immediate questions or concerns, but I appreciate the reminder that it's okay to make mistakes and take things one step at a time. It helps to keep that perspective.

Therapist: Samantha, it sounds like you're really making progress and understanding your thought patterns better. Let's role-play the scenario with your parents at the family dinner.

You're sitting at the dinner table, and your mom starts asking about the business. She's questioning your decisions, and you start to feel like you need to justify everything. What do you say to her? Remember, our goal is to practice assertive and balanced communication.

You can start by taking a deep breath, and then responding in a calm and confident tone. For example, you might say something like, "Mom, I appreciate your interest in my business, but I'd rather not discuss it too much tonight. Can we talk about it another time?" or "I understand you're concerned about my decisions, but I've thought this through and I'm confident in my choices."

As we role-play, I'll play the role of your mom, and you can practice responding in a way that feels assertive and balanced.

Regarding your "reset" button, taking three deep breaths is a great start. We can also work on other simple activities that can help you calm down and refocus. Maybe we can explore some mindfulness exercises or physical activities that can help you relax when you feel overwhelmed.

For your homework, I'd like you to practice thought reframing in at least three situations this week where you tend to catastrophize. Remember to take a step back, identify your negative thoughts, and reframe them in a more balanced and realistic way.

Also, let's work on finding a more balanced way to cope with the pressure of tight deadlines. Maybe we can brainstorm some strategies together, such as breaking down larger tasks into smaller, achievable goals, or finding ways to prioritize and manage your time more effectively.

Lastly, remember that it's okay to make mistakes and take things one step at a time. You're learning and growing, and that's what's most important. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to share them, and we can discuss them further.

Let's move forward with the role-playing exercise. Are you ready to start?

Patient: Yes, I'm ready to start the role-playing exercise. Let's imagine we're at the family dinner, and my mom starts questioning my business decisions. I'll take a deep breath and try to respond in a calm and confident tone.

Mom: "Samantha, I've been hearing some things about your business. Are you sure you're making the right decisions? It seems risky to me."

Samantha: "Mom, I appreciate your concern, but I've thought this through carefully. I'm confident in my choices, and I'm learning a lot from this experience. Can we talk about something else for now?"

I think that response feels assertive and balanced. It acknowledges her concern without getting defensive, and it redirects the conversation to something else.

For the "reset" button, I'll definitely practice taking three deep breaths when I feel overwhelmed. I'll also try to incorporate some mindfulness exercises, like focusing on my breath or doing a quick body scan, to help me calm down.

For the tight deadlines, I'll work on breaking down larger tasks into smaller, achievable goals. I'll also try to prioritize my tasks more effectively and set realistic deadlines for each step. This way, I won't feel like everything has to be perfect all at once.

I'll commit to practicing thought reframing in at least three situations this week. I'
