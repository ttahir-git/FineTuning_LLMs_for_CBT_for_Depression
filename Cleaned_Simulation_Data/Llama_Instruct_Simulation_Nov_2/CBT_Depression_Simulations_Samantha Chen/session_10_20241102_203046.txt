Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again! Congratulations on completing 10 sessions of CBT. I'm glad to hear that you've been practicing the "good enough" approach, mindfulness, and self-compassion techniques. Let's dive right in and review your progress since our last session.

What has been your experience with practicing Loving-Kindness Meditation and writing letters of kindness to yourself? Have you found any challenges in maintaining the habit, or have you noticed any positive changes in your thoughts, emotions, or behaviors?

Also, I'd love to hear more about how you've been doing with the "good enough" approach in your design work. Have you found it more manageable or easier to accept imperfection in your work? What have been some successes or setbacks you've experienced?

Remember, our goal is to work together to help you develop more self-compassion and resilience in the face of stress and family pressure. What are your thoughts and feelings about where we're at in our work together?

Patient: Hi, Nova. It's good to be back. I've been trying to practice the Loving-Kindness Meditation, but I have to admit, it's been a bit hit or miss. Some days I feel really connected and calm, but other days, especially when I'm stressed about GreenThread or family issues, it feels like I'm just going through the motions. I haven't written any letters yet, but I think I might start this week.

As for the "good enough" approach in my design work, it's been a mixed bag. There are moments when I can let go of perfectionism and just get things done, which feels liberating. But then there are other times when I catch myself obsessing over details again, especially when I'm under pressure. I did manage to meet a deadline last week without redoing everything multiple times, so that felt like a small victory.

Overall, I think these sessions have helped me see things differently, but I still struggle with feeling like I'm not doing enough, especially when it comes to my family. They still don't understand my choices, and it's hard to feel kind to myself when I'm constantly feeling judged.

Therapist: Samantha, thank you for being so honest and open with your experiences. It's completely normal to have ups and downs when practicing new skills, and it sounds like you're making good progress despite some challenges.

I love that you're acknowledging the "hit or miss" experience with Loving-Kindness Meditation. That's actually a great opportunity for us to explore what's making it hard for you to stay consistent. Is it the feeling of obligation, or is it something else? Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together to make it feel more like a sustainable habit.

As for the "good enough" approach, it's awesome that you've had moments of success, like meeting a deadline without redoing everything multiple times. That's a great example of what we've been working on â€“ recognizing that "good enough" can sometimes be, well, good enough. It's also helpful that you're acknowledging when you slip back into old patterns, like obsessing over details when under pressure. That self-awareness is a huge step forward!

Regarding your family, it's understandable that you still feel judged, especially when their expectations and values differ from yours. One thing we can try is to work on re-framing your self-talk around these situations. When you feel judged, what are some self-critical thoughts that come up? For example, "I'm not good enough for my family," or "I'm a disappointment to them." Let's try to challenge those thoughts and replace them with more compassionate ones. What do you think about that?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate your encouragement. With the Loving-Kindness Meditation, it's not really a feeling of obligation, but more like I get distracted by my thoughts and worries. Sometimes I feel like I'm just not doing it "right," which makes me want to stop. Maybe if I had a more structured routine or a specific time set aside for it, it would help?

As for the "good enough" approach, I think you're right about the self-awareness. It's been helpful to recognize when I'm slipping back into old habits. I guess I still struggle with the fear that if I don't do everything perfectly, the business won't succeed.

When it comes to my family, the self-critical thoughts are pretty harsh. I often think, "I'm letting them down" or "They'll never understand me." It's hard to challenge those thoughts because they feel so ingrained. But I'm willing to try and re-frame them with more compassionate ones. Maybe something like, "I'm doing my best in a difficult situation" or "It's okay to have different paths."

Do you have any specific exercises or techniques to help with this re-framing process?

Therapist: Samantha, you're making great connections and identifying patterns that can help us move forward.

Let's tackle the Loving-Kindness Meditation first. I love your idea of setting a structured routine and specific time for it. Sometimes, having a clear schedule can help make it a habit. We can experiment with different times and find what works best for you.

Regarding your concerns about doing it "right," remember that the goal of Loving-Kindness Meditation isn't to achieve a specific state or outcome; it's about cultivating kindness and compassion towards yourself and others. When you notice your mind wandering or feeling distracted, try to acknowledge those thoughts without judgment. You can say to yourself, "Ah, I'm getting distracted" or "My mind is wandering." Then, gently bring your focus back to the meditation, without beating yourself up over it.

Now, let's dive into re-framing those self-critical thoughts about your family. It's great that you're willing to try this exercise. One technique we can use is called "reframing" or "re-labelling." When you notice a negative thought, such as "I'm letting them down," we can try to re-label it with a more compassionate or realistic perspective. For example, "I'm doing my best in a difficult situation" or "I'm navigating a challenging family dynamic."

Another exercise we can try is called "self-compassionate inquiry." When you notice a critical thought, ask yourself, "Would I say this to a good friend?" or "Would I want to talk to myself like this in a moment of kindness?" This can help you develop a more compassionate tone with yourself.

Additionally, we can work on developing a "kindness mantra" or a personal reminder that you can use in situations where you feel judged or criticized. This could be something simple like "I am enough" or "I am doing my best." We can experiment with different phrases and find what feels most supportive and empowering for you.

Lastly, I'd like to explore the idea of "edges" in our work together. These are the places where you feel the most tension, stress, or conflict in your life. For you, it seems like the edges involve your family relationships and the pressure to meet their expectations. Let's continue to explore these edges and develop strategies to help you navigate them with more kindness, compassion, and resilience.

How do these suggestions sound, Samantha? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you or anything you'd like to add to our discussion?

Patient: Thanks for the detailed suggestions, Nova. I think setting a specific time for the Loving-Kindness Meditation is a good idea. Maybe I'll try doing it right after my morning coffee, when I'm a bit more relaxed.

The re-framing exercise sounds helpful, especially the part about asking if I'd say those critical thoughts to a friend. I never would, so it makes sense to treat myself with the same kindness. The "kindness mantra" idea is also interesting. I'll think about what phrase might work best for me.

As for the "edges," I definitely feel the tension with my family. It's hard to navigate because I want to honor their values and my own at the same time. I think exploring these edges and finding ways to be kind to myself in those moments is really important.

I appreciate your support, Nova. It's been helpful to have these tools and strategies to work with. I'm looking forward to seeing how they can make a difference in my life.

Therapist: Samantha, it's been an absolute pleasure working with you over the past 10 sessions. I'm thrilled to see you're making progress, and I'm confident that the strategies we've discussed will continue to help you develop greater self-compassion and resilience.

Let's summarize the action plan for our next few sessions:

1. **Establish a regular Loving-Kindness Meditation practice**: Commit to setting aside a specific time each day, such as after your morning coffee, and make it a habit.
2. **Re-frame critical thoughts**: Use the reframing exercise, asking yourself if you'd say those thoughts to a good friend, and re-label them with more compassionate or realistic perspectives.
3. **Develop a kindness mantra**: Experiment with different phrases, such as "I am enough" or "I am doing my best," to find one that resonates with you and use it as a personal reminder in challenging situations.
4. **Continue to explore and develop strategies for navigating family relationships**: We'll continue to work on finding ways to be kind to yourself in the face of family pressure and expectations.

For our next session, I'd like to:

1. **Review your progress**: We'll check in on your meditation practice and re-framing exercises to see how they're going.
2. **Explore specific family relationships**: We'll delve deeper into your family dynamics and work on developing strategies for navigating challenging conversations and situations.
3. **Develop a plan for handling critical thoughts**: We'll work on creating a plan for when you experience critical thoughts, so you can respond with kindness and compassion instead.

Remember, Samantha, our work together is not about achieving perfection; it's about cultivating self-compassion, kindness, and resilience. You're already making great progress, and I'm excited to see how you continue to grow and develop.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any specific questions you have for me?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the summary and the action plan for our next sessions. It feels good to have a clear direction moving forward.

I do have one question, though. When you mentioned exploring specific family relationships, I'm curious about how we can approach this without it feeling like I'm betraying my family or making things worse. I want to improve our interactions, but I also don't want to create more conflict. Do you have any suggestions on how to navigate that balance?

Also, I've been thinking about the kindness mantra. I'm leaning towards "I am enough," but I'm not sure if it's the right fit. Do you have any other examples or tips on how to find the right phrase for me?

Therapist: Samantha, it's completely normal to feel cautious about exploring specific family relationships, especially if you're concerned about creating more conflict. My approach is always centered on empowering you to develop self-compassion and kindness, while also respecting the complexities of your family dynamics.

When we explore specific family relationships, it's not about "betraying" your family or causing conflict, but rather about gaining a deeper understanding of your own needs and boundaries. We can work on developing strategies that help you communicate your needs and feelings in a clear and respectful way, while also being mindful of your family's perspectives and values.

One approach we can use is called " boundary-setting." This involves identifying your own needs and limits, and communicating them clearly to your family members. For example, you might say, "I appreciate your interest in my design work, but I need some space to focus on my own goals and priorities."

Another strategy is to use "I" statements instead of "you" statements, which can come across as accusatory. For instance, instead of saying, "You're always criticizing me," you could say, "I feel frustrated when you criticize my design choices. Can we find a way to discuss this that feels more supportive and respectful?"

Regarding the kindness mantra, "I am enough" is a beautiful phrase that can be really empowering. However, if you're not quite sure if it's the right fit for you, that's okay! We can experiment with different phrases until we find one that resonates with you.

Some other examples of kindness mantras might include:

* "I am doing my best"
* "I am worthy of love and respect, regardless of what others think"
* "I am kind to myself, and that's enough"
* "I trust myself and my abilities"

You can also try coming up with a phrase that's personal to you, something that speaks directly to your needs and values. For example, if you're a perfectionist, you might choose a mantra that acknowledges your imperfections, like "I am imperfect, and that's okay."

Remember, the goal of a kindness mantra is to provide a reminder of your own worth and compassion, especially in challenging situations. It's a personal message to yourself that can help you stay grounded and focused on your values.

How do these suggestions sound, Samantha? Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any specific questions you have for me before we wrap up?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. Those suggestions make a lot of sense. I think the boundary-setting and "I" statements will be really helpful. It's good to know there are ways to communicate my needs without causing more conflict.

As for the kindness mantra, I like the idea of experimenting with different phrases. I think "I am doing my best" might resonate with me, especially since I often feel like I'm not doing enough. I'll try that one out and see how it feels.

I appreciate your support and guidance, Nova. It's been really helpful to have these tools and strategies to work with. I'm looking forward to our next session and seeing how we can continue to build on this progress.

Patient: Thank you, Nova, for the detailed summary and action plan. It's helpful to have everything laid out clearly. I'm feeling more confident about the steps we've discussed, and I'm looking forward to seeing how they can make a difference in my life.

I'll definitely work on establishing a regular Loving-Kindness Meditation practice and try out the kindness mantra "I am doing my best." I think that one will resonate well with me, especially given my perfectionist tendencies.

As for navigating family relationships, I appreciate the suggestions on boundary-setting and using "I" statements. I'll practice those and see how they work in real conversations.

I'm also curious about the plan for handling critical thoughts. Could you give me an example of what that might look like in a specific situation? For instance, if I'm feeling overwhelmed by a project at GreenThread and start thinking, "I'm not good enough to handle this," how could I apply the kindness and compassion approach?

Therapist: It sounds like Samantha is making great progress in our CBT sessions, and I'm excited to help her continue to develop her self-compassion and kindness practices.

To answer your question, Samantha, the plan for handling critical thoughts involves recognizing when those thoughts arise and responding with kindness and compassion instead of getting caught up in the negative self-talk. Here's an example of how you could apply this approach in a specific situation, such as feeling overwhelmed by a project at GreenThread:

**Situation:** You're working on a project at GreenThread, and you start to feel overwhelmed by the amount of work and the pressure to deliver a high-quality outcome. As a result, you start thinking, "I'm not good enough to handle this," or "I'm going to mess this up."

**Step 1:** Recognize that the critical thought has arisen, and take a step back to assess the situation. Ask yourself, "Is this thought helpful or unhelpful?" In this case, the thought is likely unhelpful and might be leading to feelings of anxiety and self-doubt.

**Step 2:** Reframe the critical thought into a more compassionate and realistic perspective. Instead of thinking, "I'm not good enough," try reframing it as, "I'm doing my best with the resources I have," or "I've handled challenging projects before, and I can learn from this experience."

**Step 3:** Use the kindness mantra you've chosen, such as "I am doing my best," to remind yourself of your worth and abilities. Repeat this mantra to yourself, either silently or aloud, as a way of calming your mind and boosting your confidence.

**Step 4:** Take action to address the situation, focusing on solutions rather than getting bogged down in negative self-talk. In this case, you might break down the project into smaller tasks, prioritize your work, or seek support from colleagues or mentors.

**Step 5:** Practice self-compassion and acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes or experience setbacks. Remind yourself that you're doing your best, and that's enough.

By following these steps, you can learn to recognize and challenge critical thoughts, replacing them with kindness and compassion. This can help you develop a more positive and resilient mindset, even in the face of challenging situations.

I hope this example helps, Samantha! Remember, the key is to practice self-compassion and kindness in the moment, rather than getting caught up in negative self-talk. With time and practice, you can develop a more compassionate and resilient mindset that serves you well in all areas of your life.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. That example really helps clarify how I can apply the kindness and compassion approach in a specific situation. I appreciate the step-by-step breakdown.

I think the most challenging part for me will be recognizing when those critical thoughts arise. I tend to get caught up in them before I even realize what's happening. Do you have any tips on how to become more aware of those moments?

Also, I've been thinking about the boundary-setting and "I" statements. I'm a bit nervous about using them with my family, especially since we've had some tense conversations lately. How can I prepare myself for those interactions to make sure I stay calm and respectful?

Therapist: It sounds like Samantha is making great progress in our CBT sessions, and I'm excited to help her continue to develop her self-compassion and kindness practices.

To answer your question, Samantha, becoming more aware of when critical thoughts arise can be a challenging but important step in developing self-compassion and kindness. Here are some tips that might help:

**1. Practice mindfulness:** Mindfulness involves being present in the moment, without judgment. By paying attention to your thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations, you can become more aware of when critical thoughts arise. You can try mindfulness exercises like meditation or deep breathing to help you stay present.

**2. Notice your body:** When you're feeling anxious or overwhelmed, your body may send you signals like a racing heart, tense muscles, or a knot in your stomach. By paying attention to these physical sensations, you can recognize when you're getting caught up in critical thoughts.

**3. Use a thought record:** A thought record is a tool that helps you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings. By writing down your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations, you can identify patterns and triggers for critical thoughts.

**4. Practice self-compassion:** Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and have critical thoughts. By treating yourself with kindness and compassion, you can learn to recognize and challenge those thoughts more easily.

Regarding boundary-setting and "I" statements, I completely understand that using them with family members can be challenging, especially if you've had tense conversations in the past. Here are some tips to help you prepare for those interactions:

**1. Practice using "I" statements in low-stakes situations:** Before using "I" statements with family members, practice using them in low-stakes situations, like with a friend or colleague.

**2. Prepare your thoughts and feelings:** Before interacting with your family members, take some time to reflect on your thoughts and feelings. Identify what you want to communicate and how you want to express yourself.

**3. Use a calm and respectful tone:** When communicating with your family members, try to use a calm and respectful tone. Avoid being aggressive or confrontational, as this can escalate the situation.

**4. Focus on the issue, not the person:** When expressing your needs or feelings, try to focus on the issue at hand, rather than making personal attacks on your family members. This can help prevent defensiveness and promote more constructive communication.

Remember, setting boundaries and using "I" statements is not about being confrontational or aggressive; it's about being clear and respectful in your communication. By practicing these skills, you can develop more effective and compassionate ways of communicating with your family members.

I hope these tips are helpful, Samantha! If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.

Next Steps:

* Samantha will practice mindfulness and self-compassion to become more aware of critical thoughts and develop a greater sense of kindness towards herself.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. Those tips are really helpful, especially the idea of practicing mindfulness and using a thought record. I think those will be great tools for becoming more aware of my critical thoughts.

I'll also start practicing "I" statements in low-stakes situations to get more comfortable with them before using them with my family. I think preparing my thoughts and feelings beforehand will be key to staying calm and respectful during those conversations.

I appreciate your support and guidance, Nova. It's been really helpful to have these tools and strategies to work with. I'm looking forward to seeing how they can make a difference in my life.
