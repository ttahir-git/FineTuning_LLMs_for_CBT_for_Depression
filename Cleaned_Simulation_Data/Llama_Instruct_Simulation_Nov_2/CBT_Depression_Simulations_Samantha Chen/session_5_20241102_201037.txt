Therapist: Hello Samantha! Thank you for coming back to our session today. It sounds like you've been actively working on implementing the strategies we discussed last time. I'm glad to hear that the "pre-game" strategy has been helpful for you, and that you're making progress with value-based decision making.

Before we dive into today's agenda, I'd like to check in with you: what has been your experience like since our last session? Have you noticed any significant changes in how you approach high-pressure situations or how you treat yourself? Are there any challenges or difficulties you've encountered while implementing the new strategies?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for checking in. Since our last session, I've been trying to use the "pre-game" strategy before important meetings and deadlines. It's been a bit hit or miss, but when I do remember to use it, I feel more centered and less anxious. I've also been using the mindfulness apps more regularly, which has helped me stay grounded during stressful moments.

One challenge I've faced is that my perfectionism still creeps in, especially when I'm working on new designs for GreenThread. I find myself redoing sketches multiple times, which can eat up a lot of time. I'm trying to remind myself to set more realistic expectations, but it's an ongoing struggle.

Another difficulty is that my family still doesn't understand my career change, and the arguments have continued. It's been hard to stay focused on my values when I'm constantly feeling judged. I've been avoiding family dinners more often, which isn't great for our relationship.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your experience, Samantha. It sounds like you've made some progress with the strategies we discussed, and that's great to hear. The "pre-game" strategy and mindfulness apps seem to be helpful tools for you.

It's also understandable that your perfectionism is still a challenge. Redoing sketches multiple times can be a productivity drain. Let's explore this further. Can you tell me more about what's driving your perfectionism in this situation? Is it a fear of failure, a need for control, or something else?

Regarding your family situation, I'm sorry to hear that the arguments continue. It can be really tough to navigate these kinds of conversations, especially when you feel judged. Can you help me understand what you think would make your family more understanding of your career change? Is there something specific you'd like to communicate to them, or a way you'd like to approach the conversation differently? 

Also, I want to acknowledge that avoiding family dinners is not an ideal solution, but it's also not surprising given the stress you're under. Let's work on finding ways to address the underlying issues and improve your communication with your family. What do you think are some potential benefits of having open and honest conversations with them?

Patient: Sure, Nova. When it comes to my perfectionism with the sketches, I think it's a mix of fear of failure and a need for control. I'm so invested in GreenThread that I can't bear the thought of something not being perfect. I want everything to be just right, and that's where the redoing comes in. It's like I'm trying to control every aspect to avoid any potential mistakes.

As for my family, I wish they could see that this career change isn't just a whim. I want them to understand that I'm passionate about sustainable fashion and that I believe in what I'm doing. I think if I could communicate my values and the long-term vision for GreenThread more clearly, they might be more supportive. But every time we talk, it feels like they're just waiting for me to fail, which makes it hard to stay calm and rational.

I know avoiding family dinners isn't the answer, but it's been a way to protect myself from the constant criticism. I think if we could have more open and honest conversations, it might help bridge the gap. Maybe if they see that I'm serious and committed, they'll start to understand and support me better. But I'm not sure how to get there without things getting heated.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Samantha. It sounds like you have a deep-seated need for control, which is driving your perfectionism. It's also understandable that you feel a strong emotional investment in GreenThread. It's like you're putting a piece of yourself into every sketch, and the fear of failure is overwhelming.

Let's break this down further. Can you think of a time when you weren't so invested in a project? Perhaps a project from your past where you had a different level of emotional attachment? How did you approach it, and what did you learn from that experience?

Regarding your family situation, I want to acknowledge that it can be really tough to have open and honest conversations when you feel judged. But I also want to explore the idea that maybe your family members are coming from a place of concern or worry, rather than trying to undermine you. Can you imagine how they might feel if you were in their shoes? What might they be thinking or feeling?

Let's also talk about how you can communicate your values and vision for GreenThread more clearly to your family. What are some specific messages or stories you could share with them that would help them understand your passion and commitment? How can you approach the conversation in a way that feels safe and calm for both of you?

One technique we can use to help you feel more grounded and calm in these conversations is called "reframing." We can work together to reframe the way you think about your family's reactions. Instead of seeing them as criticism or judgment, can we start to see it as an opportunity for growth and understanding? What if you framed their comments as "concerns" rather than "attacks"? How might that shift your perspective?

Patient: I see what you're getting at with the need for control and the emotional investment. I think back to when I was working on a project in college. It was a group project for a business class, and I wasn't as emotionally attached to it as I am to GreenThread. I remember I was more relaxed and focused on collaboration rather than perfection. I learned that sometimes, letting go a bit can lead to better outcomes because it allows others to contribute and bring new ideas.

Regarding my family, I can see how they might be coming from a place of concern. They've always been protective of me, and maybe they're worried that I'm taking too big of a risk. If I were in their shoes, I might feel the same way. They probably want to see me succeed and are afraid that this new path might lead to failure.

To communicate my values and vision more clearly, I could share stories about the impact of fast fashion on the environment and how GreenThread aims to make a difference. I could also talk about the positive feedback I've received from early customers and how it motivates me to keep going. Maybe if I can show them the tangible progress and the positive reception, they'll start to see that this isn't just a whim.

As for reframing their comments, I think it could help to see their concerns as genuine worries rather than attacks. If I can approach the conversation with empathy and understanding,

Therapist: It sounds like you're making some great connections and insights, Samantha. It's wonderful that you're thinking about how your family might be coming from a place of concern and that you're willing to explore ways to communicate your values and vision more clearly.

Reframing their comments as concerns rather than attacks is a great exercise. Let's take it a step further. What if, instead of taking their concerns personally, you can acknowledge them as valid and then respond in a way that addresses their worries? For example, you could say, "I understand that you're worried about my risk-taking, but I want to reassure you that I've done my research and I have a solid plan in place. I appreciate your concern, but I'd love to share more about my vision and how I'm committed to making GreenThread a success."

Remember, reframing doesn't mean dismissing or minimizing their concerns, but rather acknowledging their feelings and responding in a way that addresses their needs. This can help to create a more constructive and supportive conversation.

Now, let's talk about a specific plan for approaching the next conversation with your family. What are some specific steps you can take to prepare for the conversation? What are some things you can do to feel more confident and centered in your approach?

Also, I want to remind you that it's okay to take your time and not have all the answers. This is a process, and it's okay to learn and adapt along the way. Remember that you're not alone in this journey, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Before we conclude, I'd like to assign some homework for you to work on between sessions. Can you commit to practicing reframing and preparing for the next conversation with your family? I also want you to continue using the "pre-game" strategy and mindfulness apps to help you feel more centered and grounded. Finally, I'd like you to write down three specific messages or stories that you can share with your family to help them understand your values and vision for GreenThread.

How does that sound? Are you ready to take the next step in this process?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I appreciate the support and the practical steps you're suggesting. I'll definitely work on reframing their comments and preparing for the next conversation with my family. I think having specific messages and stories ready will help me feel more confident and clear in my approach.

For the homework, I'll continue using the "pre-game" strategy and mindfulness apps to stay grounded. I'll also write down three specific messages or stories to share with my family. One could be about the environmental impact of fast fashion, another about the positive feedback from early customers, and a third about my long-term vision for GreenThread.

I'm ready to take the next step in this process. Thanks for your guidance, Nova.
