Therapist: Nice to meet you, Samantha. Welcome to our CBT session today. I'm glad you've taken the first step in reaching out for help. Feeling down can be a really challenging experience, and it's great that you're taking proactive steps to address it.

Before we begin, I want to assure you that everything we discuss in this room will be kept confidential. I'm here to support you, not to judge you. My goal is to help you identify and work through the issues that are contributing to your feelings of distress.

To get started, can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on that's been making you feel down? What's been on your mind lately?

Patient: Thank you, Nova. It's been a tough few months, especially since I left my corporate job to start my own eco-friendly clothing line, GreenThread. I've invested a lot of my savings and taken out loans, and the financial pressure is overwhelming. I'm constantly worried about whether the business will succeed. On top of that, my relationship with my parents has become really strained. They don't understand why I left a stable, high-paying job, and they think I'm being reckless. It's been hard to cope with their disappointment and the guilt I feel about it.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that with me, Samantha. It sounds like you're facing a lot of challenges, both internally and externally, since leaving your corporate job. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and guilty about pursuing your passion for GreenThread.

Can I just acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to take a risk like this, and it's great that you're following your values and pursuing something that's meaningful to you? At the same time, it's clear that this decision has led to a lot of uncertainty and stress in your life.

Can you tell me more about these financial worries? What specific thoughts are going through your mind when you think about your loans and the financial pressure on the business? For example, are you thinking "I'll never be able to pay this off," or "I'm going to ruin my life with debt"?

Patient: Yes, those thoughts are exactly what I've been having. I keep thinking, "What if I fail and lose everything?" or "I'm going to disappoint everyone who believed in me." It's like a constant loop in my head, and it's exhausting. I can't seem to shake the fear that I've made a huge mistake.

Therapist: Samantha, it sounds like those negative thoughts are creating a sense of dread and anxiety for you. It's like a constant, nagging voice in your head that's making it hard for you to feel confident and hopeful about GreenThread.

Let's break this down together. It sounds like these thoughts are a mix of catastrophic thinking (e.g., "I'll lose everything") and self-blame (e.g., "I'm going to disappoint everyone"). These thoughts might be based on some realistic concerns, but they're also being amplified by your fears and emotions.

I'd like to try a little exercise to help us challenge these thoughts. Can you tell me, what's the evidence for these thoughts? In other words, what's the worst-case scenario, and how likely is it to happen?

Also, let's explore the idea that you might be using "all or nothing" thinking, where you're framing your situation as an either/or proposition (i.e., you'll either succeed or fail). Is that a fair description of how you're thinking?

Patient: Yes, that's a fair description. I do tend to think in extremesâ€”either everything will work out perfectly, or it will all fall apart. The worst-case scenario is that I lose all my savings, default on my loans, and have to go back to working a corporate job, which I don't want to do. But realistically, even if things don't go perfectly, there are steps I can take to mitigate the damage. I just need to remind myself of that.

Therapist: Samantha, it sounds like you're starting to identify some patterns in your thinking, such as all-or-nothing thinking and catastrophic thinking. These thought patterns can be really helpful to become aware of, as they can contribute to feelings of anxiety and dread.

Let's continue to work on challenging these thoughts. You mentioned that the worst-case scenario is that you lose all your savings, default on your loans, and have to go back to working a corporate job. While that's certainly a possible outcome, how likely is it that it will happen? On a scale of 1-10, how probable do you think that is?

Also, let's focus on the present moment. Rather than catastrophizing about the future, can you think of any specific steps you can take right now to address your financial worries? For example, have you created a contingency plan in case things don't go as smoothly as you'd like? Have you considered seeking out resources or support to help manage your business's finances?

It's also worth exploring the idea that you're not defined by your business or your job. You're a person with your own strengths, weaknesses, and passions, and there are many aspects of your life that aren't directly related to GreenThread.

Let's work on reframing some of these negative thoughts. For example, instead of thinking "I'll lose everything," what would it be like to think "I'll learn and grow from this experience, no matter the outcome"? Or "I'll take it one step at a time and focus on making progress, rather than worrying about the future"?

Can you think of any ways in which you might be able to reframe these thoughts in a more realistic and empowering way?

Patient: I see what you're saying about reframing my thoughts. Instead of thinking "I'll lose everything," I could try thinking "I'll learn and grow from this experience, no matter the outcome." That does sound more empowering.

As for specific steps, I have been trying to create a contingency plan. I've been reaching out to mentors in the sustainable fashion industry for advice, and I'm considering hiring a financial advisor to help me manage my business's finances better. I know I can't control everything, but I can take proactive steps to improve my situation.

I also need to remind myself that my worth isn't solely tied to my business. I have other interests and passions, like yoga and organic gardening, that bring me joy and fulfillment. It's important to remember that even if GreenThread doesn't succeed in the way I hope, I'm still a whole person with many positive qualities and experiences.

Therapist: Samantha, it sounds like you're making some excellent progress in our session today. You're starting to recognize and challenge some of the negative thought patterns that have been contributing to your anxiety and guilt.

I love that you're thinking about reframing your thoughts in a more realistic and empowering way. By shifting from "I'll lose everything" to "I'll learn and grow from this experience," you're taking the focus off of catastrophizing and putting it on personal growth and resilience.

It's also fantastic that you've been taking proactive steps to address your financial worries, such as seeking out mentors and considering hiring a financial advisor. Remember that it's okay to ask for help and guidance, especially when facing uncertainty.

I want to highlight the importance of self-compassion and self-awareness in this process. You're recognizing that your worth isn't solely tied to your business, and that's a beautiful thing. By acknowledging your strengths and passions outside of GreenThread, you're giving yourself permission to be a multifaceted person with many interests and values.

Before we wrap up our session today, I want to encourage you to continue practicing these skills and strategies in the coming days and weeks. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you can learn from them. And when those negative thoughts start creeping in, try to reframe them in a more realistic and empowering way.

For homework, I'd like you to continue working on your contingency plan and seeking out resources to support your business. I'd also like you to schedule some time for self-care and reflection, perhaps by trying out a new yoga class or spending an hour in your organic garden. Remember that taking care of yourself is essential to navigating this challenging time.

How do you feel about our session today, Samantha? Is there anything in particular that resonated with you or any questions you'd like to explore further in our next session?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful after our session today. It's helpful to know that I can challenge those negative thoughts and take proactive steps to improve my situation. I'll definitely work on my contingency plan and seek out more resources for my business.

As for self-care, I've been neglecting that lately. I think scheduling time for yoga and gardening sounds like a good idea. It's important to take care of myself, even when things feel overwhelming.

I do have one question, though. How can I better manage the guilt I feel about disappointing my parents? It's been a constant source of stress, and I'm not sure how to handle it.
