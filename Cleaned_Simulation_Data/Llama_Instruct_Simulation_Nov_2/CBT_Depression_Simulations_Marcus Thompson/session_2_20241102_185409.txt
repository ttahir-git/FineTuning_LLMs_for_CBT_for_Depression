The session ended with Marcus feeling more equipped with practical tools to manage his stress and guilt, particularly focusing on work and family obligations as starting points.

Therapist: Hello again, Marcus. It's great to see you again in our 2nd CBT session. I'll start by asking how you feel about the progress we made in our last session. Can you tell me what's been on your mind lately, and how you've been feeling about the exercises and strategies we discussed?

Also, I'd like to ask: How would you rate your emotional distress level today, on a scale of 1-100?

Patient: Hey, Nova. It's good to be back. I've been thinking a lot about the exercises we talked about last time. The Responsibility Pie Chart really helped me see where I'm spreading myself too thin. I've been trying to break down my tasks more, and it's making a difference. I'm not feeling as overwhelmed as I was.

As for the daily reflection practice, I've been writing down three accomplishments each day. It's surprising how much that helps. I don't feel like such a failure when I see all the little things I'm getting done.

Emotional distress level today? I'd say it's around 65/100. It's still high, but it's an improvement from the 75 we talked about last time.

Therapist: Excellent progress, Marcus. It sounds like the Responsibility Pie Chart and daily reflection practice have been really helpful in reducing your feelings of overwhelm and guilt. It's also wonderful that you're acknowledging your small wins each day, which can really boost self-esteem.

Before we dive deeper, I want to acknowledge that a 10-point reduction in emotional distress is a significant improvement. That takes a lot of courage and effort. I'm proud of you for taking these steps and seeking support.

Now, I'd like to explore a bit further. You mentioned that the Responsibility Pie Chart has helped you see where you're spreading yourself too thin. Are there any areas where you feel like you're still struggling to set realistic boundaries or manage your responsibilities? Additionally, I'm curious to know more about how your mother's Alzheimer's diagnosis and co-parenting after divorce are still impacting you. How have you been feeling about those aspects of your life recently?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It means a lot to hear that. 

Yeah, there are still some areas where I'm struggling to set boundaries. Work is a big one. I keep taking on more projects and responsibilities at school because I feel like I have to. It's hard to say no when I see the need, especially with the kids.

As for my mom, it's been tough. Her condition is progressing, and I feel this constant pressure to be there for her. I spend most weekends at her place, trying to help out, but it's exhausting. I worry about her all the time, and I feel guilty when I can't be there.

Co-parenting with my ex-wife, Sarah, is another area where I'm struggling. We're trying to make it work, but it's complicated. I want to be there for my kids, but I also need to take care of myself. It's hard to balance everything.

So, yeah, those are the main areas where I'm still feeling the strain.
