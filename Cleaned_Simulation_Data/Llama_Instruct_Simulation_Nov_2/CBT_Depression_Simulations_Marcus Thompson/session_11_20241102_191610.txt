Thank you for sharing your understanding and commitment to trying the Time Cube exercise, Marcus. Your approach sounds well-thought-out and organized. Before we wrap up today's session, I'd like to make sure we're clear on next steps:

1. You'll create your Time Cube this week, including noting overlapping tasks and using the 1-3 priority system
2. You'll start tracking your progress using a calendar or habit tracker
3. You'll review how this system is working for you at our next session

Would you like to schedule a specific time to review your Time Cube together next session? This would give us a chance to discuss any challenges you've encountered and make adjustments if needed.

Also, is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end today's session? Any concerns or questions about implementing this new system?

Remember, the goal isn't perfection - it's about finding a better balance that works for you and your family. How are you feeling about taking on this new organizational approach?

Therapist: Hello again, Marcus. It's great to see you're committed to implementing the Time Cube exercise. I'm glad we could solidify the next steps together. Regarding scheduling a specific time to review your Time Cube next session, I think that's a great idea. Let's plan on doing that during our next session, which is in two weeks. Would 15-20 minutes be sufficient for us to review your progress and make any necessary adjustments? 

Before we conclude today's session, I do want to check in on how you're feeling about starting this new approach. Are you feeling any anxiety or resistance about implementing this system? Have you had any moments of uncertainty or self-doubt since our last session? 

Additionally, I want to acknowledge that managing time and prioritizing tasks can be complex, especially when balancing family responsibilities. Are there any specific challenges or areas where you're feeling stuck, and would you like some additional guidance or support?

Patient: Thanks for checking in, Nova. I appreciate the support. Honestly, I do feel a bit anxious about starting the Time Cube system. There's a part of me that worries I won't be able to stick to it, especially with everything else going on. I mean, I've got lesson planning, community work, co-parenting, and now caring for my mom. It feels like a lot to juggle.

But at the same time, I know I need to try something different. I've been feeling so overwhelmed lately, and I think this could help. I just hope I can find the right balance.

As for specific challenges, I'm really struggling with the time I spend with my kids. I feel like I'm always rushing them, and I don't want them to feel neglected. Do you have any tips on how to make sure I'm giving them the attention they need while still managing everything else?
