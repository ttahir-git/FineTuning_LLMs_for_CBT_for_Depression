Thank you for sharing those insights, Marcus. I can hear how deeply ingrained these patterns of thinking are, and how they're affecting multiple areas of your life. Let's try something together.

I'd like to introduce a concept called "the oxygen mask principle." You know how on airplanes they tell you to put your own oxygen mask on before helping others? This isn't selfish - it's necessary for survival and being able to help others effectively. How would it feel to apply this principle to your life?

Let's do a quick exercise. Imagine you're advising a close friend who's in your situation - someone who's trying to support their family, make a difference in their community, and be there for everyone. What would you tell them about taking time for self-care? Would you see them as selfish for needing to recharge?

This might help us start to challenge some of these deeply held beliefs about selfishness and responsibility. What are your thoughts on this?
