Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again. I can see that you've made some progress since our last session, and I'm proud of the efforts you've been making. I'd like to review the progress you've made and see if there's anything that's still challenging for you.

You mentioned that breaking down tasks has reduced your feeling of being overwhelmed, which is fantastic. And it's also great to hear that daily accomplishment tracking has improved your self-perception. These are both important steps in managing your stress and building your confidence.

However, it seems like your main stressors remain in three key areas: work boundaries, caregiving for your mother, and co-parenting. These are all significant challenges, and it's clear that setting boundaries is still an area of struggle for you. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on in these areas since our last session? What's been most difficult for you, and what do you think might be getting in the way of setting more effective boundaries?

Patient: Hey, thanks for the encouragement. It's been a mixed bag, honestly. The daily reflection practice has really helped me see that I'm accomplishing more than I give myself credit for, which is a big relief. But yeah, those three areas—work, my mom, and co-parenting—they're still weighing heavy.

At work, I've been trying to set boundaries, but it's tough when the kids need so much. I end up staying late to help them with projects or just to talk, and then I'm exhausted when I get home. I know I need to leave on time more often, but it feels selfish to just walk away when they're struggling.

With my mom, her condition is getting worse. She's forgetting more and more, and I feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up. I'm trying to balance visits with her and still be there for my kids, but it's a tightrope. I feel guilty leaving her alone, even for a few hours.

Co-parenting is another beast. Sarah and I are doing our best, but it's hard to coordinate schedules and make sure the kids are getting what they need from both of us. I want to be more involved, but I also need to protect my own energy. It's a constant push and pull.

I think what's getting in the way of setting better boundaries

Therapist: I'm so glad you shared more about your experiences, Marcus. It sounds like you're really struggling with the guilt and responsibility of meeting the needs of multiple people in your life. It's as if you're caught between feeling selfish for setting boundaries and feeling overwhelmed by the demands on you.

Let's break this down further. Can you tell me more about this sense of guilt you're feeling? Where does it come from, and what do you think it's trying to protect or achieve? Is it related to your upbringing, past experiences, or something else entirely?

Also, I want to acknowledge that it's amazing that you're recognizing the importance of setting boundaries. That takes a lot of self-awareness and courage. Have you considered what might happen if you did set more consistent boundaries? What benefits might you experience, and how might your life change?

We can also explore some specific strategies for setting more effective boundaries, especially in the context of work, caregiving, and co-parenting. Perhaps we can identify some small, manageable steps you can take to start building those boundaries and reduce your sense of guilt.

Patient: Thanks for understanding, Nova. The guilt, it's like a constant hum in the background. I think it comes from growing up in a single-parent household where my mom worked multiple jobs just to keep us afloat. I saw how hard she worked, and I promised myself I'd never let anyone down like that. So, when I set boundaries, it feels like I'm letting people down—my students, my mom, my kids. It's like I'm betraying that promise to myself.

If I set more consistent boundaries, I think I'd have more energy and focus for the things that really matter. I could be more present with my kids, spend quality time with my mom without feeling rushed, and maybe even have some time for myself. But the fear of letting people down is strong.

As for strategies, I'm open to anything that can help. Maybe we can start with something small, like setting a specific time to leave work each day and sticking to it. Or maybe I can find a way to involve others in helping with my mom, so I'm not shouldering everything alone. Any ideas on how to start?

Therapist: It sounds like the guilt you're experiencing is deeply rooted in your past experiences and the promises you made to yourself. It's as if you're trying to live up to the example of your hardworking single parent and avoid feeling like you're abandoning those who rely on you.

First, let's acknowledge that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and set boundaries. It's not about letting people down; it's about being present and responsible in the ways that matter most to you.

Let's explore the idea of "enoughness." What does it mean for you to feel like you're being a good enough parent, partner, and son? Is it about meeting everyone's needs, or is it about being present and showing up in meaningful ways?

Regarding setting boundaries, let's start with the small, manageable step of setting a specific time to leave work each day. We can work together to identify a realistic time frame and create a plan to stick to it. Perhaps we can also brainstorm ways to involve others in helping with your mother's care, such as hiring a caregiver or enlisting the help of family members or friends.

Another idea is to practice self-compassion and reframe your guilt as a signal that you're taking care of yourself. When you feel that guilt creeping in, try to rephrase it as, "I'm taking care of myself by prioritizing my own needs." Repeat this phrase to yourself, and see how it feels to acknowledge that your well-being matters.

Let's also talk about what you can realistically do to support your mother and co-parent with Sarah. What are some small steps you can take to show up in meaningful ways, even if it's not in the exact way you're used to?

Lastly, let's schedule some homework for you to practice setting those boundaries and prioritizing your own needs. Can you commit to setting that specific time to leave work each day for the next week? And are there any other small steps you're willing to take to show up in your own life and the lives of those you care about?

Patient: Thanks for the support, Nova. I think "enoughness" is a good concept to explore. For me, being a good enough parent, partner, and son means showing up in meaningful ways, even if I can't do everything. It's about quality over quantity, right?

Setting a specific time to leave work each day sounds doable. Maybe I can aim to leave by 5 PM. That gives me enough time to wrap up what I need to and still have some energy left for my family. I'll try to stick to that and see how it goes.

As for involving others in helping with my mom, I've been hesitant to hire a caregiver because it feels like I'm outsourcing my responsibility. But maybe I can start by asking a few close family members or friends if they can help out occasionally. It might ease the burden a bit.

Practicing self-compassion is something I need to work on. I'll try that phrase you suggested when I feel guilty about setting boundaries. It might help me reframe my thinking.

For homework, I'll commit to leaving work by 5 PM each day this week. I'll also reach out to a few family members to see if they can help with my mom. And I'll keep practicing that self-compassion phrase.

Thanks for the guidance, Nova. I feel like we're making some real progress here.
