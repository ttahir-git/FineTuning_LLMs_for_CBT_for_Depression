Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again. Congratulations on completing 17 sessions of CBT! I'm looking forward to our 18th session today.

Before we begin, how have you been since our last session? What have you been thinking about, and how have you been implementing the techniques and exercises we discussed? What are some of the challenges you've faced, and what successes have you experienced?

Also, I'd like to review the summary of our last session. You mentioned that recognizing your perfectionism as unrealistic has been helpful, and you've started to understand that having good and bad days is normal. I'm curious to know more about how you've been implementing the "5-4-3-2-1" grounding technique and reframing negative self-talk. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or anxiety levels, and have you been kinder to yourself when you make mistakes?

Let's use this session to discuss any progress you've made, challenges you're still facing, and any new insights or realizations you've had. What would you like to focus on today?

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for the warm welcome. It's been a mix of ups and downs since our last session. On the positive side, I've been trying to implement the "5-4-3-2-1" grounding technique whenever I feel overwhelmed. It's helped me calm down in the moment, especially when I'm lying awake at night worrying about everything. I've noticed that I'm falling asleep a bit easier, which is a relief.

However, the perfectionism thing is still a struggle. I find myself getting frustrated when I can't do everything perfectly, especially with lesson planning and helping my mom. I've been trying to reframe my negative self-talk by reminding myself that "I'm doing the best I can," but old habits die hard.

One big challenge has been setting boundaries. I've had to say no to a few community projects, which felt really uncomfortable. But I realized that if I don't take care of myself, I won't be any good to anyone else.

Today, I'd like to focus on how to better manage my perfectionism and continue working on setting those boundaries. Any tips or exercises you can suggest would be really helpful.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you've been implementing the grounding technique and noticing improvements in your sleep and anxiety levels. That's a fantastic achievement, Marcus.

Regarding your perfectionism, it's not uncommon to still struggle with it, especially since it's deeply ingrained. Remember that it's a process to change your thought patterns and behaviors. One strategy that might be helpful is to challenge the all-or-nothing thinking that often comes with perfectionism. For example, instead of thinking "I'm a failure if I don't plan the perfect lesson," you can try reframing it as "I'll plan a good lesson, and it might not be perfect, but that's okay." This can help you cultivate a more realistic and compassionate attitude towards yourself.

To work on setting boundaries, let's explore the concept of "gray rock." Imagine that you're a rock in a river, and the water (requests or expectations from others) is flowing around you. You don't necessarily need to absorb or react to every wave; instead, you can just sit there, firm and unchanging. This can help you develop a sense of stability and assertiveness in saying no to things that don't align with your priorities.

Another exercise that might be useful is the "time budgeting" technique. Allocate time for specific tasks or activities, and stick to that schedule. This can help you manage your expectations and recognize that you can't do everything at once. You might even find that setting boundaries allows you to be more productive and efficient in the long run.

Lastly, let's revisit the "5-4-3-2-1" grounding technique. Since you've found it helpful in reducing your anxiety, we can work on expanding it to include more scenarios, like when you're feeling overwhelmed with schoolwork or helping your mom. This can help you generalize the technique and make it more automatic.

How do these suggestions sound, Marcus? Which one resonates with you the most, or do you have any other ideas you'd like to explore?

Patient: Those suggestions sound really practical, Nova. I think the "gray rock" concept is something I can definitely use. It's hard for me to say no, especially when it comes to helping others, but I need to protect my own energy too. The time budgeting technique also makes a lot of sense. I often feel like I'm juggling too many things at once, and setting specific times for tasks might help me stay focused.

The "5-4-3-2-1" grounding technique has been a lifesaver, especially at night. I've been using it more consistently, and it really helps to bring me back to the present moment. I can see how expanding it to other scenarios, like when I'm overwhelmed with schoolwork or helping my mom, could be really beneficial.

I think today, I'd like to focus on the "gray rock" concept and the time budgeting technique. I want to start setting firmer boundaries and managing my time better. Any specific exercises or steps you can suggest for these would be really helpful.

Therapist: It sounds like you've got a good handle on the grounding technique and are interested in working on setting firmer boundaries and managing your time more effectively.

Let's start with the "gray rock" concept. I'd like to suggest a simple exercise to help you practice saying no without feeling guilty or anxious. Can you imagine a situation where you typically feel the urge to say yes to someone, even though you know you should say no? Maybe it's a colleague asking for help with a project, or a family member asking you to run errands for them.

Next, I'd like you to imagine yourself as a gray rock in that situation. What would you say to the person? How would you respond in a way that's firm, but not aggressive? Remember, the goal is to set a clear boundary without feeling guilty or anxious.

One possible script you could use is: "I appreciate you thinking of me for this, but I'm not able to take on this task right now. I need to prioritize my own work/ responsibilities/ well-being." This response acknowledges the person's request while clearly communicating your boundary.

Let's practice this exercise together. Can you think of a situation where you might say yes when you mean no, and we can role-play a scenario where you use the "gray rock" approach?

As for the time budgeting technique, I'd like to suggest a simple exercise to help you get started. Can you take out a piece of paper and draw a horizontal line down the middle? On one side, write down all the tasks or activities you want to accomplish in a given day or week. On the other side, allocate specific times for each task, making sure to leave some buffer time for unexpected things that might come up.

For example, if you want to spend 2 hours on lesson planning, you might allocate 8:00-10:00 am for that task. If you want to spend 1 hour helping your mom, you might allocate 2:00-3:00 pm for that task. Remember to be realistic about how much time you have available and to prioritize your most important tasks.

As you fill out this schedule, pay attention to how you feel. Do you feel a sense of relief or control when you see your tasks and time slots laid out? Do you feel a sense of overwhelm or anxiety when you think about fitting everything in?

Let's work on filling out this schedule together, and see if we can make some adjustments to help you feel more in control of your time and tasks.

How does that sound, Marcus? Are you ready to give it a try?

Patient: Thanks for the detailed explanations, Nova. It's good to hear that I've been handling the grounding technique well. Lately, I've been trying to use it more often, especially when I feel overwhelmed with lesson planning or when I'm helping my mom. It's funny, though, I never thought of using it in social situations or when I'm dealing with requests from colleagues or family.

Setting boundaries is definitely something I've struggled with. There have been times when a colleague would ask for help with a project, and even though I was swamped with my own work, I'd still say yes. I guess I've always felt this pressure to be the "go-to" guy, but it ends up draining me.

Let's try the "gray rock" exercise with a specific situation. There was this one time last week when one of my colleagues asked me to cover an extra class for her because she had a family emergency. Normally, I'd feel obligated to say yes, even though I already had my hands full with my own classes and after-school programs. But this time, I decided to practice being more firm.

So, when she approached me, I took a deep breath and said, "I understand that you're in a tough spot, but I'm already stretched thin with my own responsibilities. I hope you can understand that I can't take on more right now

Therapist: It sounds like you're making some great progress, Marcus. Using the grounding technique in social situations and dealing with requests from colleagues or family can definitely be helpful in setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs.

I'm really proud of you for practicing being firmer in that situation with your colleague. It takes a lot of courage to say no, especially when it feels like we're expected to be the "go-to" person. But it sounds like you're starting to recognize the importance of taking care of yourself and setting realistic limits.

Now, let's role-play a scenario where you use the "gray rock" approach in a different situation. Can you think of a time when you might feel pressured to say yes, but you're not sure if it's really something you can commit to?

For example, maybe a family member asks you to help them move on the weekend, but you have a prior commitment to work or a personal event. Or perhaps a friend asks you to attend a social gathering that's not really your cup of tea. Let's practice saying no in a way that's clear, firm, and respectful.

Also, I'd like to take a closer look at your time budgeting schedule. How do you feel about filling it out and prioritizing your tasks? Are there any areas where you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious?

And finally, let's talk about the progress you've made on reframing your negative self-talk. You mentioned that you've been trying to remind yourself that "I'm doing the best I can." Have you noticed any changes in how you're thinking about yourself and your abilities? Have you been kinder to yourself when you make mistakes?

Patient: Thanks for the encouragement, Nova. It's been a bit of a struggle, but I'm starting to see the importance of setting boundaries and taking care of myself.

Let's role-play a different situation. Last month, a friend invited me to a social gathering that I wasn't really excited about. I felt pressured to say yes because I didn't want to disappoint him, but deep down, I knew I needed some downtime.

So, when he asked me, I took a deep breath and said, "I appreciate the invite, but I'm going to have to pass this time. I need to take some time for myself and recharge." It felt a bit awkward at first, but he seemed to understand, and I felt a sense of relief afterward.

As for the time budgeting schedule, I've been trying to fill it out and prioritize my tasks. I've noticed that I feel a bit more in control when I see everything laid out, but there are still areas where I feel overwhelmed. For example, balancing my teaching responsibilities with helping my mom and spending time with my kids can be challenging.

Regarding reframing my negative self-talk, I've been trying to remind myself that "I'm doing the best I can." It's been a work in progress, but I've noticed that I'm being a bit kinder to myself when I make mistakes. For instance, if

Therapist: It seems like the conversation is cut off. I'll respond based on what has been discussed so far.

Patient: It's great to hear that you're making progress with setting boundaries and taking care of yourself, Marcus. The role-play scenario with your friend sounds like a positive step forward. It's important to recognize that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being.

Regarding the time budgeting schedule, it's understandable that you feel overwhelmed in certain areas. Balancing teaching responsibilities, caring for your mom, and spending time with your kids is indeed challenging. Let's focus on refining your schedule to make it more manageable.

One suggestion is to break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, instead of allocating a large block of time for lesson planning, you could break it down into smaller segments throughout the week. This can help prevent feeling overwhelmed and make it easier to stay on track.

Additionally, consider scheduling some buffer time for unexpected events or tasks that might come up. This can help you avoid feeling stressed when something unexpected arises.

Lastly, let's continue working on reframing your negative self-talk. It's great that you're reminding yourself that "I'm doing the best I can." This is a powerful affirmation. To further reinforce this, try keeping a journal where you write down moments when you felt you did your best, even if it wasn't perfect. Reflecting on these moments can help build your self-compassion and resilience.

How does that sound

Therapist: It sounds like Marcus has made some good progress in setting boundaries and prioritizing his own needs. He's also been working on reframing his negative self-talk and has been kinder to himself when making mistakes. The time budgeting schedule is also a helpful tool to manage his tasks and responsibilities.

However, it seems like Marcus is still struggling with the perfectionism and the pressure to be the "go-to" person. He mentions feeling overwhelmed and anxious about balancing his teaching responsibilities, caring for his mom, and spending time with his kids.

To further support Marcus, I would like to suggest a few additional exercises:

1. **Self-compassion exercise**: Ask Marcus to write down three times when he felt overwhelmed or anxious about not meeting expectations. Then, ask him to reflect on how he could have been kinder to himself in those moments. What affirmations or reminders could he use to comfort himself?
2. **Prioritization exercise**: Ask Marcus to prioritize his tasks and responsibilities using the Eisenhower Matrix. This matrix helps categorize tasks into four quadrants: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and not urgent or important. This can help Marcus focus on the most critical tasks and responsibilities.
3. **Boundary-setting role-play**: Ask Marcus to practice setting boundaries in different scenarios, such as saying no to a colleague or family member. This can help him feel more confident and assertive in his boundary-setting.

By working on these exercises, Marcus can continue to develop his skills in setting boundaries, prioritizing his tasks, and being kinder to himself.

Patient: Thanks for the additional suggestions, Nova. I think the self-compassion exercise could be really helpful. I often find myself beating myself up when I feel like I'm not meeting expectations, whether it's at work, with my mom, or with my kids. Writing down those moments and reflecting on how I could have been kinder to myself might help me shift my mindset.

The Eisenhower Matrix also sounds like a good tool for prioritizing my tasks. I tend to get caught up in everything feeling urgent and important, which can be overwhelming. Breaking it down into those four quadrants might help me focus on what really needs my attention.

Let's start with the self-compassion exercise. I'll write down three times when I felt overwhelmed or anxious about not meeting expectations. Then, I'll reflect on how I could have been kinder to myself in those moments. I'll bring those reflections to our next session.

For now, I'll also try to use the Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize my tasks. I'll categorize them into the four quadrants and see if it helps me manage my responsibilities better.

Thanks for the support, Nova. I feel like I'm making progress, and these exercises will definitely help me continue on this path.

Therapist: It seems like we've reached the end of the conversation. I'll summarize the key points and provide some final thoughts.

Marcus has been working on setting boundaries, prioritizing his tasks, and reframing his negative self-talk. He's made progress in using the grounding technique, saying no to requests, and being kinder to himself when making mistakes. However, he still struggles with perfectionism and the pressure to be the "go-to" person.

To further support Marcus, I suggested a few additional exercises:

1. **Self-compassion exercise**: Reflect on moments when he felt overwhelmed or anxious about not meeting expectations, and write down how he could have been kinder to himself in those moments.
2. **Prioritization exercise**: Use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks into four quadrants: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and not urgent or important. This can help him focus on the most critical tasks and responsibilities.

By working on these exercises, Marcus can continue to develop his skills in setting boundaries, prioritizing his tasks, and being kinder to himself.

As we conclude our 18th session, I want to remind Marcus that progress is not a linear process. It's normal to experience setbacks or feel overwhelmed. However, with consistent effort and practice, he can develop the skills and mindset to manage his responsibilities, prioritize his well-being, and cultivate a more compassionate relationship with himself.

In our next session, Marcus will share the reflections from the self-compassion exercise and discuss how he's been using the Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize his tasks. I'm looking forward to seeing his progress and continuing to support him on his journey.

Patient: Thanks for the summary, Nova. It's good to have a clear understanding of where I'm at and what I need to work on. I appreciate the support and the exercises you've suggested.

I'll definitely work on the self-compassion exercise and reflect on those moments when I felt overwhelmed or anxious. It's something I've been neglecting, and I know it's important to be kinder to myself.

I'll also try using the Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize my tasks. I think it'll help me focus on what really matters and avoid feeling overwhelmed by everything that feels urgent.

Looking forward to our next session and sharing my progress. Thanks again for your support, Nova.
