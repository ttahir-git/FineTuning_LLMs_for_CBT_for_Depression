Therapist: Welcome back, Marcus. I apologize again for the interruption last session. I'm glad we're able to continue our work together. Before we dive into new topics, I'd like to acknowledge the progress you've made so far. You've been doing some great work on setting boundaries and recognizing the need to reframe questions about your self-worth.

To recap, I'd like to ask: How have you been feeling about your progress with the "gray rock" approach and Eisenhower Matrix since our last session? Have you noticed any changes in your thoughts, feelings, or behaviors?

Patient: Thanks for acknowledging the progress, Nova. It's been a mixed bag, honestly. The "gray rock" approach has helped me avoid getting sucked into unnecessary drama with some of my more challenging students and colleagues. It's like I'm not feeding the fire, you know? But at the same time, I feel a bit disconnected, like I'm not fully present.

As for the Eisenhower Matrix, I've been using it to prioritize my tasks, especially with my mom's care and lesson planning. It's definitely helped me focus on what's most important, but I still find myself getting overwhelmed by the sheer volume of things I need to do. It's like I'm juggling too many balls at once, and I'm afraid one of them is going to drop.

Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of a paradox, Marcus. On one hand, the "gray rock" approach has been helpful in setting boundaries and reducing drama, but on the other hand, you're feeling disconnected and not fully present. And with the Eisenhower Matrix, while it's helping you prioritize, it's also making you feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tasks.

It's as if you're feeling a sense of trade-off, like you're having to choose between being effective and being fully engaged. This can be a difficult spot to be in, and it's not uncommon.

One thought that might be helpful to consider is that maybe your sense of disconnection and overwhelm are not necessarily about the "gray rock" approach or the Eisenhower Matrix itself, but rather about the underlying assumptions or values that are driving your behavior. For example, are you assuming that being the "go-to" person is essential to your sense of self-worth, or that you need to be constantly productive and efficient? These are questions that might be worth exploring further.

In terms of next steps, I'd like to suggest that we break down this paradox further, and see if we can identify any small, actionable steps that you can take to address these feelings of disconnection and overwhelm. Would that be something you'd be open to exploring further?

Patient: Yeah, that makes sense. I do feel like I'm constantly trying to balance being effective and being present, and it's tough. I guess I do have this underlying assumption that being the "go-to" person is essential for my self-worth. It's like if I'm not constantly productive and efficient, I'm not doing enough, especially with everything going on with my mom and my students.

Breaking down this paradox further sounds like a good idea. I'm open to exploring that. Maybe we can start by looking at specific situations where I feel this disconnection or overwhelm, and see if there's a way to address those feelings in a more manageable way.

Therapist: It sounds like you're beginning to peel back the layers, Marcus, and identify some of the underlying assumptions that may be contributing to your feelings of disconnection and overwhelm. Recognizing these patterns is a huge step forward in our therapeutic work.

Let's indeed start by examining specific situations where you feel this disconnection or overwhelm. Can you think of a particular scenario or situation that's been coming up for you lately, where you felt like you were struggling to balance being effective and present? It could be a specific interaction with a student, a conversation with a colleague, or even just a particular task or responsibility that's been weighing on you.

As we explore this scenario together, I'll be asking you questions to help you identify any patterns or themes that may be contributing to your feelings. We can also start to brainstorm some small, actionable steps that you can take to address these feelings in the moment. Sound like a plan?

Patient: Sure, Nova. One situation that's been coming up a lot lately is my interactions with my students, especially during our after-school programs. I feel like I have to be super engaged and enthusiastic to keep them motivated, but at the same time, I'm exhausted from everything else going on in my life. It's like I'm putting on a show, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up.

I also feel this pressure to be the perfect teacher, the one who always has the right answers and never shows any weakness. It's exhausting, and I end up feeling disconnected from them, even though I care so much about their success.

So, yeah, that's one specific scenario where I've been feeling this disconnection and overwhelm. Let's explore that further.

Therapist: Marcus, thank you for sharing that scenario with me. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge those feelings of exhaustion and disconnection.

One thing that stands out to me is the sense of performance and perfectionism that you're describing. It sounds like you're feeling like you're under a microscope, and that your students are judging you as a teacher. This can be a very pressure-filled and overwhelming experience.

I'd like to explore this idea with you a bit further. Can you tell me more about what happens for you when you feel like you're not being the perfect teacher? What thoughts do you have about yourself, and what emotions do you experience?

Also, I want to ask you a question: What would happen if you were to allow yourself to be imperfect, just for a moment, during those after-school programs? What would it be like to let go of the need to have all the answers and to be completely in control?

Let's explore this idea of imperfection and how it might impact your relationships with your students and your own sense of self-worth.

Patient: When I feel like I'm not being the perfect teacher, I start to have these negative thoughts about myself. I think things like, "I'm letting them down," or "They'll see me as weak." It's like I'm constantly worried about what they'll think of me if I don't have it all together.

The emotions that come up are mostly guilt and anxiety. I feel guilty for not being able to give them my all, and anxious about how they'll perceive me if I slip up. It's a tough cycle to break because I care so much about making a positive impact on their lives.

As for your question about allowing myself to be imperfect, it's something I've never really considered. I guess part of me is afraid that if I let go of the need to have all the answers, they'll lose respect for me or think less of me as a teacher. But another part of me knows that being human and showing vulnerability might actually help build a stronger connection with them.

I'm curious to explore this idea further. What would it look like to let go of the need to be perfect, even just for a moment? How could I start to practice that in my interactions with my students?

Therapist: Marcus, it sounds like you're beginning to tap into some of the deeper underlying patterns that are driving your need for perfection. Recognizing that your self-worth is tied to being the perfect teacher is a huge insight. It's no wonder you're feeling exhausted and disconnected when you're carrying that weight.

One way to start letting go of the need to be perfect is to practice self-compassion. I'd like to suggest that we do a self-compassion exercise together. Imagine that you're talking to a close friend who's struggling to be perfect in their interactions with their students. What words of kindness and understanding would you say to them?

Also, let's explore the idea of "good enough." Can you think of a time when you've had a conversation or interaction with someone where you were "good enough," and it didn't have to be perfect? What did that feel like? Was there a sense of relief or freedom in being "good enough"? Let's brainstorm some ways that you can start to practice being "good enough" in your interactions with your students.

Patient: Sure, Nova. Let's do that self-compassion exercise. If I were talking to a close friend who's struggling to be perfect in their interactions with their students, I'd probably say something like, "You're doing your best, and that's enough. Your students care about you and appreciate the effort you put in. It's okay to have off days and to not have all the answers. You're human, and that's what makes you relatable."

As for the idea of "good enough," I can think of a few times when I've had conversations with my students where I didn't feel the need to be perfect. For example, during our mentoring sessions, I sometimes just listen to them talk about their lives, and we don't always have to solve problems or give advice. It's more about being present and showing that I care. Those moments feel more genuine and less stressful.

I think practicing being "good enough" could involve setting realistic expectations for myself and my students. Maybe I could start by acknowledging that it's okay to have days where I'm not at my best and that it's more important to be present and supportive than to be perfect. I could also try to share more of my own struggles and vulnerabilities with them, to show that it's okay to not have it all together.

What do you think, Nova? How can I start

Therapist: I'm glad we're exploring this idea of being "good enough" together, Marcus. It's a powerful concept that can help you release some of the pressure you're putting on yourself.

Setting realistic expectations is a great place to start. Rather than aiming for perfection, you could try setting more achievable goals, like "Today, I'll show up and be present with my students, even if I don't have all the answers." Or, "I'll focus on listening to their concerns and offering support, rather than trying to solve every problem."

Sharing your own struggles and vulnerabilities with your students can be a powerful way to build connections with them. It can help them see that you're human, too, and that it's okay to not have all the answers.

One exercise that might be helpful is to practice self-compassion during those moments when you feel like you're not being perfect. Take a few deep breaths, and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes. Repeat some kind words to yourself, like "I'm doing my best," or "I'm enough." See if you can cultivate a sense of kindness and understanding towards yourself in those moments.

Another idea is to try to reframe your thinking around what it means to be a good teacher. Instead of focusing on being perfect, you could try to define what it means to be a good teacher for you. What values are important to you in your teaching? What qualities do you want to cultivate in your relationships with your students?

Let's explore these ideas further and come up with some small, actionable steps you can take to start practicing being "good enough" in your interactions with your students.

Patient: Thanks, Nova. Setting realistic expectations and reframing what it means to be a good teacher sound like good strategies. I think for me, being a good teacher means being present, supportive, and empathetic. It's not about having all the answers but about being there for my students and helping them navigate their challenges.

One small step I can take is to start each day by reminding myself of these values. I could write them down on a sticky note and place it on my desk as a daily reminder. Another step could be to practice self-compassion during those moments when I feel like I'm not being perfect. I could take a few deep breaths and repeat some kind words to myself, like "I'm doing my best" or "I'm enough."

I also like the idea of sharing more of my own struggles and vulnerabilities with my students. Maybe during our mentoring sessions, I could open up about some of the challenges I'm facing, like balancing work and caring for my mom. This could help them see that it's okay to not have it all together and that we're all in this together.

What do you think, Nova? Are these steps in the right direction?

Therapist: Marcus, I'm so proud of you for taking these steps towards practicing being "good enough" in your interactions with your students. Setting realistic expectations, reframing what it means to be a good teacher, and practicing self-compassion are all great strategies.

I love the idea of writing down your values on a sticky note and placing it on your desk as a daily reminder. That's a simple yet effective way to keep yourself focused on what's most important. And practicing self-compassion during moments of imperfection is a game-changer. Remember, it's okay to make mistakes and that you're doing your best.

Sharing your own struggles and vulnerabilities with your students is also a great idea. It's a powerful way to build connections with them and create a sense of community in the classroom. By being willing to be vulnerable, you're showing your students that it's okay to be imperfect and that everyone faces challenges.

As we move forward, I'd like to suggest that we continue to work on these strategies and explore ways to apply them in your daily interactions with your students. We can also start to brainstorm more specific examples of how you can share your own struggles and vulnerabilities with them.

Additionally, I'd like to offer you a homework assignment to practice self-compassion. For the next week, whenever you feel like you're not being perfect, take a few deep breaths and repeat some kind words to yourself. It could be as simple as "I'm doing my best" or "I'm enough." See how it feels to cultivate a sense of kindness and understanding towards yourself in those moments.

Lastly, I want to remind you that it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to have all the answers or be perfect all the time. Remember, being "good enough" is a journey, and it's okay to take your time figuring it out.

How do you feel about taking on these assignments, Marcus? Are there any other questions or concerns you have about practicing being "good enough" in your interactions with your students?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. I appreciate the encouragement and the homework assignment. I think it's a good idea to keep practicing self-compassion and reminding myself that it's okay to not be perfect. I'll definitely try to take a few deep breaths and repeat some kind words to myself when I feel like I'm not being perfect.

As for sharing my own struggles and vulnerabilities with my students, I'm a bit nervous about it, but I think it's important. I'll start by opening up about some of the challenges I'm facing during our mentoring sessions and see how it goes. I'm hopeful that it will help build a stronger connection with them and create a sense of community in the classroom.

I don't have any other questions or concerns right now, but I'll let you know if anything comes up. Thanks again for your support, Nova. I'm looking forward to seeing how these strategies work in practice.

Therapist: It sounds like you've made some great progress, Marcus. Practicing self-compassion, reframing what it means to be a good teacher, and sharing your own struggles and vulnerabilities with your students are all important steps towards being "good enough." Remember, it's a journey, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.

Before we conclude, I'd like to summarize our plan for the next week. You'll be practicing self-compassion by taking a few deep breaths and repeating kind words to yourself whenever you feel like you're not being perfect. You'll also be sharing your own struggles and vulnerabilities with your students during your mentoring sessions. And, as we discussed earlier, you'll be setting realistic expectations and focusing on being present, supportive, and empathetic in your interactions with them.

Remember, it's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to not have all the answers. By being "good enough," you're showing your students that it's okay to be imperfect and that everyone faces challenges.

Before we go, I'd like to offer you a final thought: being a good teacher is not just about what you do in the classroom, but also about how you show up to yourself and your students every day. By being kind, compassionate, and authentic, you're creating a positive impact that extends far beyond the classroom.

How do you feel about this plan, Marcus? Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or add before we conclude?

Patient: I feel good about the plan, Nova. Practicing self-compassion and sharing my struggles with my students are definitely steps in the right direction. I'm committed to giving it a try and seeing how it impacts my interactions with them.

I appreciate your final thought about being a good teacher extending beyond the classroom. It's a good reminder that my impact as a teacher is not just about what I do in the classroom, but also about how I show up in my own life and in my relationships with my students.

I don't have anything else to add right now, but I'll let you know if anything comes up during the week. Thanks again for your support, Nova. I'm looking forward to our next session.

Therapist: Based on the conversation, it appears that Marcus has made significant progress in acknowledging his perfectionism and the impact it has on his relationships with his students. He is beginning to recognize the value of being "good enough" and is willing to take small steps towards practicing self-compassion and sharing his vulnerabilities with his students.

Some potential next steps for Marcus include:

1. Continuing to practice self-compassion by taking a few deep breaths and repeating kind words to himself when he feels like he's not being perfect.
2. Sharing his own struggles and vulnerabilities with his students during mentoring sessions and seeing how it impacts their relationships.
3. Setting realistic expectations and focusing on being present, supportive, and empathetic in his interactions with his students.
4. Reframing what it means to be a good teacher and focusing on qualities such as kindness, compassion, and authenticity.

It may be helpful to explore further how Marcus can continue to develop these skills and how he can apply them in different situations. It may also be helpful to continue to monitor Marcus's progress and provide ongoing support and guidance as he works towards becoming more comfortable with being "good enough.".

Patient: I appreciate the summary and the potential next steps, Nova. It's good to have a clear plan moving forward. I'll definitely continue to practice self-compassion and share my struggles with my students. I'm hopeful that these steps will help me become more comfortable with being "good enough."

I'm also open to exploring how I can develop these skills further and apply them in different situations. If there are any specific exercises or techniques you recommend, I'd be interested in hearing about them.
