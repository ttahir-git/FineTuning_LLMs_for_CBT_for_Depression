Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to see you again in session number 13! Congratulations on making it this far in our CBT journey together.

Before we dive into the current session, I'd like to reflect on the progress you've made since our last session. It sounds like you've been actively working on implementing the Time Cube system, breaking down tasks into manageable categories, and practicing saying "no" to non-essential commitments. You've also started to recognize the connection between your childhood experiences and current behavior patterns.

It's excellent that you acknowledged the importance of seeking help, delegating tasks, and setting boundaries. These insights can be quite liberating, and it's wonderful to see you embracing these changes.

Before we proceed, what are your thoughts on the past 13 sessions? Have you noticed any significant shifts in your thoughts, feelings, or behaviors since we started working together?

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for the warm welcome. It's been a challenging but rewarding journey so far. I've definitely noticed some shifts, especially in how I approach my responsibilities. 

Using the Time Cube system has helped me see where my time is going, and it's been eye-opening. I've started to categorize tasks more effectively, which has made my days less overwhelming. Saying "no" to non-essential commitments is still tough, but I'm getting better at it.

One significant shift is that I'm more aware of how my childhood experiences influence my current behavior. It's like a light bulb went off—I see now why I tend to take on so much. It's not just about being ambitious; it's also about trying to prove something to myself and others.

Overall, I feel like I'm making progress, even if it's slow. The key for me is consistency, and I'm trying to be patient with myself. How about you, Nova? Any observations from your side?

Therapist: Marcus, it's wonderful to hear that you're experiencing significant shifts in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Your insight into how your childhood experiences are influencing your current behavior is a huge breakthrough, and I'm glad we could explore that together.

From my perspective, I've observed that you've been making consistent efforts to implement the strategies we've discussed, even when it's challenging. You're being kind to yourself, acknowledging that perfection isn't necessary, and that progress is what matters. That takes a lot of self-compassion and willingness to grow.

One thing I've noticed is that you're starting to recognize the importance of setting boundaries and prioritizing your own needs. That's a significant step towards taking care of yourself and preventing burnout. Your "Stop Doing" list is a great way to start decluttering your commitments and focusing on what's truly important.

I also appreciate that you're acknowledging your struggles with saying "no." That's a difficult but essential skill to develop, and I'm proud of you for working on it.

Before we move forward, I'd like to address one thing that caught my attention. You mentioned that consistency is key for you, and that you're trying to be patient with yourself. While it's essential to be consistent, I want to caution you against setting an unrealistic expectation for yourself. Remember that progress is often incremental, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.

Now, let's discuss the homework you've been working on since our last session. How have you been doing with practicing saying "no" and creating your "Stop Doing" list? Are there any specific challenges or successes you'd like to share?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's good to hear your observations—it helps to know I'm on the right track. 

Regarding the homework, practicing saying "no" has been a mixed bag. I had a situation last week where a colleague asked me to take on an extra committee role at school. Normally, I would have said yes without a second thought, but this time, I paused and thought about it. I ended up saying no, which felt strange but also liberating. It's like I'm breaking a habit, and it's not easy, but I'm getting there.

As for the "Stop Doing" list, I've started jotting down things that I can cut back on or eliminate. It's mostly small stuff, like checking emails late at night or spending too much time on social media. These might seem trivial, but they add up and contribute to my overall stress. I'm trying to be more mindful of these habits and replace them with more productive or relaxing activities.

One challenge I'm facing is balancing everything. Even with the Time Cube system and the "Stop Doing" list, I still feel pulled in many directions. I'm trying to schedule dedicated self-care time, but it often gets pushed aside when something urgent comes up. Any tips on how to make that self-care time stick?

Therapist: Marcus, it sounds like you're making some significant progress with practicing saying "no" and creating your "Stop Doing" list. I'm proud of you for taking a step back and considering the commitment to join that committee. Recognizing when to say no is a skill that takes time and practice, and it's great that you're working on it.

Your approach to the "Stop Doing" list is also excellent. Focusing on small habits like checking emails late at night or excessive social media use can have a big impact on your overall stress levels. It's great that you're being mindful of these habits and trying to replace them with more productive or relaxing activities.

Now, let's talk about balancing everything. I completely understand that it can be overwhelming to manage multiple responsibilities, especially when it feels like something urgent always comes up. One strategy that might help is to schedule your self-care time in advance, just like you would any other important appointment. This can help you prioritize it and make it a non-negotiable part of your daily routine.

Another idea is to start small. Instead of trying to schedule a long block of self-care time, start with something manageable, like 15-20 minutes a day. This could be as simple as taking a short walk, practicing deep breathing exercises, or reading a chapter in a book. The key is to make self-care a habit, so start small and gradually build up to longer periods of time.

Lastly, remember that self-care isn't just about taking time for yourself, but also about asking for help when you need it. Have you considered delegating some of your responsibilities to others, like your sister or a family member? This can help you free up time and energy for more important things, like self-care and relaxation.

How do these suggestions sound, Marcus? Is there anything else you'd like to add or discuss before we move forward?

Patient: Those suggestions sound really practical, Nova. I think scheduling self-care time in advance is a great idea. I often overlook it because it feels less urgent than other tasks, but it's just as important. Starting small with 15-20 minutes a day is manageable, and I can build from there.

As for delegating responsibilities, I've been hesitant because I feel like I should be doing everything myself. But you're right—asking for help can free up time and energy. I'll think about what I can delegate to my sister or other family members. It might take some pressure off and allow me to focus on self-care.

One thing I've been struggling with lately is the guilt I feel when I take time for myself. It's like I'm constantly thinking about all the things I should be doing instead. How can I work on reducing that guilt and being more accepting of self-care?
