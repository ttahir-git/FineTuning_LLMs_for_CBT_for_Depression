Therapist: Hello again, Marcus. It's great to see you for our 14th session. Congratulations on having made it this far in our CBT journey. I'm impressed by the progress you've made so far. Let's review what's been working well and what areas we can continue to work on.

It sounds like you've had some successes with saying "no" to commitments and implementing your "Stop Doing" list. Those are great steps towards taking control of your time and priorities. You've also started to make progress with self-care, recognizing its importance and making time for it.

However, you mentioned in your summary that there were still some challenges around self-care and guilt. We didn't fully explore that in our last session, so let's dive deeper into that today. What are some of the specific challenges you're facing around self-care and guilt, and how are you experiencing them?

Patient: Thanks, Nova. It's good to be back. Yeah, I've been trying to stick to that "Stop Doing" list and saying "no" more often, and it's been helping. But you're right, the self-care and guilt thing is still a big issue for me.

When I try to schedule self-care time, like you suggested, I feel this nagging guilt. It's like I'm taking time away from my kids, my mom, or my students. I know it's irrational, but it's hard to shake. I end up feeling like I'm not doing enough, even when I'm just trying to take a few minutes for myself.

And then there's the guilt about not being able to do more for my community. I see all these problems—poverty, violence, lack of resources—and I feel like I should be out there fixing them, not taking time to relax. It's like I'm letting everyone down by focusing on myself.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing this, Marcus. It sounds like we're tapping into a deeper dynamic here. That guilt you're feeling about taking time for yourself is quite common, especially when people have a strong sense of responsibility or duty towards others. It's interesting that you mention feeling guilty about not doing enough, even when you're just trying to take a few minutes for yourself. That suggests that there might be some underlying expectations or self-imposed rules that are driving this guilt.

I'd like to explore this further with you. Can you think of any childhood experiences or messages that might have contributed to this sense of responsibility or duty? Was there a time when you felt like you weren't doing enough, and that might have shaped your expectations of yourself today?

Patient: Yeah, that's a good point. I think a lot of it comes from growing up in a single-parent household. My mom, Gloria, she worked multiple jobs just to keep us afloat. I remember feeling like I had to help out as much as I could, even as a kid. I'd do chores, help with my younger cousins when they visited, and try to be as independent as possible.

There was this one time when I was about 12, and I didn't do well on a school project. My mom was so disappointed, not because of the grade, but because she felt like I wasn't living up to my potential. She told me, "Marcus, you have to be better than the rest. You have to work twice as hard because you're carrying the weight of this family."

That message stuck with me. I always felt like I had to prove myself, not just for me, but for my mom and the whole family. So now, even when I try to take a break, I feel like I'm letting everyone down. It's like I'm betraying that part of me that's always been about doing more, being more.

Therapist: It sounds like we're making some significant connections here, Marcus. It's clear that your childhood experiences, particularly your mother's message about needing to work harder to prove yourself, have had a lasting impact on your sense of responsibility and duty.

It's not uncommon for people to internalize these messages and feel like they're never doing enough. This can be a heavy burden to carry, especially when it comes to taking time for yourself.

I'd like to explore this further. Have you noticed any other areas in your life where you feel like you're not doing enough, or where you feel like you're disappointing others? For example, are there any other relationships in your life where you feel like you're not measuring up, or where you're trying to prove yourself?

Additionally, let's talk about this idea of "carrying the weight of the family." Do you think this feeling of responsibility has also influenced your relationships with your kids and your community? For instance, do you feel like you're shouldering too much of the emotional or practical burden in those relationships?

Lastly, I'd like to gently challenge this idea that you're betraying your "do more, be more" self when you take time for yourself. Can we reframe that thought, even just for a moment, and consider the possibility that taking care of yourself is not a betrayal, but rather a necessary step towards being a more whole and fulfilled person?

Patient: Yeah, I see what you're saying. There are definitely other areas where I feel like I'm not doing enough. With my kids, for example, I feel like I'm always rushing from one thing to the next, and I don't get to spend as much quality time with them as I'd like. I worry that they're missing out on having a dad who's fully present.

In my community, I feel like I'm always trying to prove myself, especially when it comes to my activism work. I'm constantly pushing myself to do more, to be more visible, to make a bigger impact. It's exhausting, but I feel like I can't stop because there's always more to be done.

And you're right about the "carrying the weight" thing. I do feel like I'm shouldering a lot of the emotional and practical burden, not just for my family, but for my community too. It's like I'm the one everyone looks to for solutions, and if I don't come up with them, I feel like I'm failing everyone.

As for reframing that thought about taking care of myself—it's tough. I guess part of me knows that if I don't take care of myself, I won't be able to help anyone else. But the other part of me feels like I'm being selfish.
