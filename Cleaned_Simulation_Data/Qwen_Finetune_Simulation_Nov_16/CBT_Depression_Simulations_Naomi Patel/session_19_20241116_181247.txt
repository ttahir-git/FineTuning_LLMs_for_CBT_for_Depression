Therapist: Welcome back, Naomi. It's great to see you again for this 19th CBT session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge a few limitations as your AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say, as I can't directly observe non-verbal cues. Lastly, I want to remind you that if you ever experience thoughts of self-harm or suicide, it's crucial to seek immediate help from a qualified professional or emergency service, as I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations. Do you have any questions or concerns about these limitations?

Patient: No questions or concerns, Nova. I appreciate you acknowledging those limitations upfront. It helps set realistic expectations for our sessions. Let's dive in.

Therapist: Great, let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have you noticed any changes in your mood or experiences?

Patient: Since our last session, I've been feeling a bit more stable, I think. I managed to have a couple of conversations with my parents using the "I" statements we talked about. It was awkward at first, but I think it helped them understand where I'm coming from a bit better. My mood has been up and down though. Some days I feel really motivated and connected to my activism work, but other days I feel drained and anxious about my academic deadlines.

Therapist: It's really great to hear that you've been having those conversations with your parents and noticing some positive changes. It's also completely normal to have those ups and downs in mood. Remember, progress isn't always a straight line. What about your homework from last session - how did it go with the thought records and self-care activities?

Patient: The thought records were helpful. I focused on a couple of situations where I felt dismissed by my parents. Writing down my thoughts and then challenging them made me realize that their reactions might not be as personal as I thought. As for self-care, I've been trying to cook more vegetarian meals and that's been a nice way to unwind. It's also helped me feel more connected to my cultural roots.

Therapist: That's fantastic, Naomi. Using thought records to challenge negative thoughts is a powerful skill, and it's great that you're applying it to situations with your parents. Incorporating self-care activities like vegetarian cooking is not only beneficial for your mental health but also a way to connect with your identity and culture. 

Now, let's set an agenda for today's session. I'd like to review the homework in more detail and discuss the situations where you used the thought records. We can also explore the ups and downs you mentioned in your mood. What would you like to prioritize today?

Patient: I'd like to prioritize discussing the ups and downs in my mood, especially the days I felt particularly down and what triggered those feelings. I think understanding those moments better could help me manage them more effectively in the future. Also, since you mentioned reviewing the thought records in more detail, I'd like to go over those a bit more to see if there are any patterns or recurring themes.

Therapist: That's a great plan, Naomi. Let's start by discussing the moments when you felt particularly down. Can you share a situation or thought that triggered those feelings? Let's explore the emotions and thoughts that came up and see if we can identify any patterns or common themes.

Patient: Sure. One recent situation was when I received feedback on a paper that I had put a lot of effort into. The feedback was constructive, but it felt harsh and made me question my abilities. I started thinking, "Maybe I'm not cut out for this program" and "I'm never going to succeed." Those thoughts spiraled, and I felt really down for the rest of the day.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. I can imagine how discouraging that feedback must have felt. Let's break this down using the thought record. In the situation column, we'll write about receiving the feedback from the professor. What were the emotions you felt in that situation and how intense were they?

Patient: In that situation, I felt disappointed (8/10), anxious (7/10), and doubtful (9/10). The intensity of those emotions really hit me hard.

Therapist: Okay, let's write those emotions down and their intensities. Now, in the automatic thoughts column, we'll write down the thoughts you identified as going through your mind: "Maybe I'm not cut out for this program" and "I'm never going to succeed." Does the thought record look like we're capturing the essence of what happened?

Patient: Yes, that seems accurate. Now, let's move on to the evidence for and against these thoughts. In the evidence for these thoughts, what are some examples that support the idea that you might not be cut out for the program? And in the evidence against these thoughts, what are some examples that contradict this belief?

Therapist: I'm glad this is capturing the essence of the situation, Naomi. Now, let's look at the evidence for and against these thoughts. In the evidence for the thought "Maybe I'm not cut out for this program," what are some examples that support this belief?

Patient: Well, the harsh feedback from the professor is a big one. It made me feel like I'm not meeting the expectations. Also, I've had a few other instances where I struggled with assignments and felt overwhelmed by the workload.

Therapist: Okay, those are important pieces of evidence to consider. Now, what about the evidence against this thought? What are some examples that contradict the idea that you might not be cut out for the program?

Patient: There are a few things that contradict that thought. For one, I've had some positive feedback on other assignments, which shows that I can do well. I've also managed to complete several projects successfully, and I've been passionate about my research topic. Plus, I've been able to handle the academic stress before, so I know I have the capacity to do it.

Therapist: That's really significant evidence against the thought that you're not cut out for the program, Naomi. It's important to consider both sides of the story, as you've had a range of experiences at the program that contradict this negative thought. Now, let's look at the evidence for the thought "I'm never going to succeed." What are some examples that support this belief?

Patient: The main example that supports this belief is the recurring feeling of being overwhelmed by the workload and the constant pressure to perform well. It feels like every time I try to catch up, something else comes up, making it hard to see a clear path to success.

Therapist: I hear you, Naomi. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed given the demands of your program. Now, what about the evidence against this thought? What are some examples that contradict the idea that you'll never succeed?

Patient: There are a few examples that contradict this thought. For instance, I've managed to complete some challenging projects in the past, which shows that I can succeed. I've also received some positive feedback from peers and mentors, which indicates that I have potential. Additionally, I've been able to find support within the LGBTQ+ community and through my hobbies, which helps me cope and stay motivated.

Therapist: That's really significant evidence against the thought that you'll never succeed, Naomi. It's important to recognize that you've had moments of success in the past, and you have the support and coping mechanisms to help you through challenges. Now, looking at the evidence for and against these thoughts, what might be an alternative thought that feels more balanced and grounded in the facts of the situation?

Patient: An alternative thought might be that while the program is challenging, I have the potential to succeed with the right support and strategies. It's not about being perfect, but about learning and growing through the process.

Therapist: That's a great alternative thought, Naomi. It acknowledges the challenges you face while also recognizing your potential and the factors that can help you succeed. How do you feel about this alternative thought compared to the original thoughts?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful with this alternative thought. It doesn't dismiss the challenges but also highlights my strengths and resources. It feels more realistic and less overwhelming.

Therapist: That's wonderful, Naomi. I'm glad this alternative thought resonates with you and provides a more balanced perspective. Let's continue to explore other situations where you felt down or doubted yourself and practice generating alternative thoughts. This can help us find more balanced and adaptive ways of thinking in those moments.

Now, as we wrap up this session, I'd like to check in with how you're feeling right now. What emotions are present for you, and how would you describe the intensity of those emotions?

Patient: Right now, I feel a mix of emotions. I'm feeling a bit more hopeful and less overwhelmed, but there's still some lingering anxiety about upcoming deadlines. The intensity of the anxiety is around a 6 out of 10, which is lower than it has been lately.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and a bit less overwhelmed, Naomi. Recognizing the lingering anxiety about deadlines is also important. Let's discuss some strategies you can use to manage the anxiety and stay grounded in the present moment.

One technique that can be helpful is mindfulness meditation. It involves focusing on the present moment without judgment, acknowledging your thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them. Even a few minutes of mindful breathing can help bring your mind to the present and reduce feelings of anxiety. Would you be willing to try incorporating some mindfulness practice into your routine, maybe before a stressful deadline or exam?

Patient: Yes, I think incorporating mindfulness practice could be really helpful. I've tried it a bit before, but I wasn't very consistent. Maybe setting a reminder on my phone to take a few minutes for mindful breathing before important tasks could help me stay consistent.

Therapist: That's a great idea, Naomi. Setting a reminder can be a helpful way to stay consistent with mindfulness practice. Another strategy we can discuss in our next session is progressive muscle relaxation, which involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in the body. This technique can help release physical tension and promote relaxation, which can be particularly helpful when you're feeling anxious about deadlines.

Speaking of deadlines, let's shift gears a bit and discuss your homework for the week. I'd like you to continue practicing thought records, focusing on situations where you feel down or doubting yourself. Try to complete at least one thought record per day, and use the evidence for and against columns to generate alternative thoughts.

I'd also like you to practice mindfulness meditation, incorporating it into your routine at least a few times per week. You can start with just a few minutes at a time, and work your way up to about 10-15 minutes as you feel more comfortable with the practice.

Finally, let's discuss your goals for your upcoming conversation with your parents. What would you like to communicate to them? What do you hope they'll understand about your identity and your experiences?

Patient: For my conversation with my parents, I want to communicate that my identity as non-binary is a fundamental part of who I am. I hope they can understand that this isn't a phase or a rebellion, but a deeply held part of my identity. I also want to share how their continued use of feminine pronouns and expectations make me feel disconnected and misunderstood. I hope they can see that my happiness and sense of self are important, and that respecting my identity is a way to support me.

Therapist: It's great that you have a clear message you want to convey to your parents, Naomi. It takes courage to share your experiences and identity with those you care about, and it's important to be specific about what you want them to understand. Remember to use "I" statements and focus on how their actions impact you, which can help promote understanding and empathy.

Before we wrap up, let's do a quick check-in on your mood and any final thoughts you have about this session.

Patient: I feel a bit more grounded after this session. The mindfulness practice and thought records seem like they could really help me manage stress better. I'm also feeling more prepared for my conversation with my parents, even though I know it might be tough. Thanks for the support, Nova.
