Therapist: Welcome back, Naomi. It's great to see you again for our 8th session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me. There's also a possibility that some of the information I provide may be inaccurate. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or emergencies. If you ever feel you need immediate help, please reach out to a local crisis hotline or emergency services. Lastly, since our communication is text-based, I'm unable to interpret non-verbal cues, so I'll be relying on your written messages to understand your experiences and emotions.

With that said, I'm excited to hear about your week and how you've been feeling since our last session. Let's start by checking in on you. How have you been doing in the week leading up to today's session?

Patient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. It's good to be aware of those. I appreciate your transparency.

This past week has been a mix of ups and downs, honestly. On the positive side, I attended a really inspiring climate change protest in Berkeley. It felt great to be part of something bigger and to connect with like-minded people. I even met someone there who shares my interest in vegetarian cooking, so we've been exchanging recipes and ideas.

However, there have been some tough moments too. My parents called last night, and it was...awkward. They still slip into using female pronouns sometimes, and it always stings. I tried to gently remind them again, but it just feels like an endless cycle. I ended up feeling really drained afterward.

How about we start by talking about that phone call? It's been on my mind a lot.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. I can imagine how painful and frustrating those moments with your parents can be. Let's definitely prioritize discussing that phone call and the feelings it brought up for you.

Before we do, let's take a moment to set an agenda for today's session. We can make sure we cover everything you'd like to discuss, and we'll also make time for homework review and any other important topics. What else would you like to add to our agenda today?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan, Nova. I think it would be helpful to review the homework we discussed last time—the thought record focusing on distorted thoughts related to guilt and family pressure. I've been keeping it up, and there are some patterns I've noticed that I'd like to talk through.

Other than that, I'm also curious about how to better manage the guilt I feel around not meeting my academic expectations. It's been a constant source of stress, especially with deadlines looming.

So, our agenda could look like this:
1. Discuss the phone call with my parents and the feelings it brought up.
2. Review the thought record homework.
3. Talk about managing guilt related to academic performance.

Does that sound okay to you?

Therapist: That agenda looks great, Naomi. It covers the important topics that are on your mind, and it allows us to address the feelings and challenges that are most pressing for you.

Let's start with the phone call with your parents. Can you tell me more about what happened during that conversation? What thoughts and emotions came up for you, and how did you navigate the situation?

Patient: Sure, I'd be happy to share more about the phone call. It started off pretty normally—we talked about how everyone was doing, the usual small talk. But then, my mom referred to me using "she/her" pronouns again. It wasn't the first time, but it still caught me off guard.

I felt a mix of emotions—frustration, sadness, and a bit of anger too. I tried to stay calm and gently reminded her that I use "they/them" pronouns now. She apologized, but it felt like an empty apology. The conversation kind of fizzled out after that, and I felt really drained by the end of it.

I guess my main thought during the call was, "Why can't they just get it right?" It's frustrating because I know they love me, but it feels like they're not really trying to understand or respect my identity.

How do you think I could handle that better next time? I don't want to keep having the same conversation over and over, but I also don't want to let it slide.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Naomi. It's understandable to feel frustrated and hurt when your parents consistently use gendered pronouns that don't align with your identity. Here are a few suggestions that might help you navigate those conversations differently:

1. Choose the right moment: Try to bring up the topic during a time when you're both in a good headspace. Avoid bringing it up when you're already stressed or when there's a lot going on.

2. Use "I" statements: Express your feelings and needs without placing blame. For example, you could say, "I feel hurt when you use the wrong pronouns. It's important for me that you use 'they/them' because it helps me feel respected."

3. Give specific examples: When correcting them, use specific examples of how they've used the wrong pronouns. This can help them better understand what you're asking for.

4. Practice assertiveness: It's okay to be assertive without being aggressive. You can say something like, "I understand that you might not always remember to use the right pronouns. If that happens, can we try to have an open conversation about it?"

5. Be patient: Change takes time, and it's not always easy for people to understand someone's identity. Keep bringing it up calmly, and it might eventually sink in.

What do you think about these suggestions? Do any of them resonate with you, or do you have any other strategies you'd like to try?

Patient: Those suggestions make sense, especially the idea of using "I" statements and being patient. It's hard for me to stay calm sometimes, especially when I'm already stressed from school, but I can see how that approach might help. I think I'll try to bring it up during a less stressful time, maybe when we're talking about something else. I've been practicing using "I" statements in my journal, so maybe that will help too.
