Therapist: Hello Marcus, it's great to meet you. I'm Nova, an AI CBT therapist. As we begin our session together, I want to acknowledge a few limitations as an AI. Firstly, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. Secondly, while I can provide guidance and support, I'm not equipped to handle crisis intervention or emergency services. Additionally, as an AI, there's a possibility that some of the information I generate may not be entirely accurate, so please feel free to correct me if something doesn't seem quite right. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can.

Patient: Hey Nova, thanks for the intro. I appreciate the heads-up about your limitations. I'll definitely let you know if anything feels off or if you mention something that doesn't align with my experience. 

So, last session we talked about setting boundaries and managing guilt when I say "no." I've been trying to practice that, but it's still tough. I find myself feeling guilty even when I know it's necessary. Any tips on how to make that transition smoother?

Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. I'm glad we can work together to find ways to make that transition smoother for you. It's not uncommon to feel guilty when setting boundaries, especially if you're used to being a "people pleaser" like you mentioned last time.

Before we dive into that, I want to check in with you. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or challenges you'd like to discuss?

Patient: Thanks for asking, Nova. Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of things. On one hand, I've been trying to set boundaries, like saying no to some extra community projects. It's been a bit of a rollercoasterâ€”I feel relieved at times, but then the guilt creeps in. 

On the other hand, my mom's condition has been getting a bit more noticeable. She's starting to forget things more often, and it's been really tough to see her struggle. I've been trying to balance my time between her and my kids, but it's been overwhelming. Any advice on how to manage that better?

Therapist: It's understandable that you're feeling a mix of emotions, Marcus. Balancing caregiving responsibilities with other commitments can be challenging, and it's normal to feel conflicted at times. 

I'm glad you're practicing setting boundaries, but it's also normal to experience guilt. Let's explore that further. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you found it hard to set boundaries and how it led to feelings of guilt?

Patient: Sure, Nova. One situation that comes to mind is when I had to say no to helping organize a community event. I usually take on a lot of these responsibilities because I want to make a difference, but this time, I knew I had too much on my plate. 

I told the organizers I couldn't help, and they were understanding, but I still felt guilty. I kept thinking, "What if they can't find someone else? What if the event doesn't go well because I wasn't there?" It's like I feel responsible for everything, even when I know I can't do it all.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that example, Marcus. It shows that even when you're setting boundaries, you're still feeling responsible for the outcome, which can lead to guilt. This ties back to the discussions we've had about your core beliefs.

Let's explore this further using a technique called the "downward arrow." We'll start with the thought you mentioned, "I feel responsible for everything," and keep asking, "If that were true, what would it mean about you?" to uncover underlying beliefs. 

I'll go first: "If it were true that you feel responsible for everything, what would it mean about you?".

Patient: If I feel responsible for everything, it would mean that I'm the one who needs to keep everyone and everything together, like I'm the glue holding everything in place. It feels like if I don't step up, things will fall apart, and that adds to the pressure and guilt.

Therapist: So, when you feel responsible for everything, it means that you believe your well-being and the well-being of others are closely tied, and that if you don't support everyone, everything will collapse. Let's explore this belief further.

What do you think is the effect of holding this belief, and how might it impact your behavior and well-being?

Patient: Holding this belief definitely impacts my behavior and well-being. It makes me take on more responsibilities than I can handle, which leads to burnout and stress. I end up neglecting my own needs and sometimes even my family because I'm so focused on trying to keep everything else together. 

It's like I'm constantly running on fumes, and I know it's not sustainable, but the thought of letting go of that responsibility feels terrifying.

Therapist: You've described a difficult cycle, Marcus. This belief of holding responsibility for everything contributes to your burnout and stress, which then leads to self-neglect and neglect of your loved ones. It's understandable that letting go of that responsibility feels terrifying, as it means facing a significant change in how you've been operating.

I want to introduce a concept called "self-care as an investment." While it may feel selfish or irresponsible to prioritize your own needs, self-care is actually an investment in your ability to support others and maintain your own well-being. It's like charging your battery so that you can keep showing up with more energy and presence.

What are your thoughts on this concept of self-care as an investment, and how might it relate to your belief of holding responsibility for everything?

Patient: That's an interesting concept, Nova. I can see how self-care as an investment could help me recharge and be more effective in the long run. But it's hard to shake the feeling that if I take time for myself, I'm letting others down. 

I guess it ties back to my belief that I need to be the one holding everything together. If I start investing in self-care, it feels like I'm admitting that I can't do it all, which is tough to accept.

Therapist: You've touched on a powerful insight, Marcus. Recognizing that self-care is an investment that benefits others as well as yourself is an important step in challenging the belief that you need to do it all. It's understandable that admitting you can't do it all feels scary. 

Let's explore that fear a bit further. What thoughts or beliefs come up for you when you consider the possibility of needing help or support in managing your responsibilities?

Patient: When I think about needing help or support, I feel a mix of emotions. On one hand, I worry that others might not step up or that they won't do it as well as I would. On the other hand, there's a fear that if I ask for help, it means I'm weak or failing in some way. 

It's like I've built this image of myself as the strong, capable one who can handle anything, and admitting I need help feels like I'm breaking that image.

Therapist: It's understandable that you feel this way, Marcus. Your fears about needing help and support reveal a common belief that self-care and asking for help are signs of weakness or failure. 

In reality, reaching out for support and prioritizing your well-being is a sign of strength and self-awareness. It takes courage to be vulnerable and recognize that you can't do it all alone.

Let's challenge this belief using a technique called the "positive data log." This involves gathering evidence that supports the idea that self-care and asking for help are signs of strength, not weakness. 

I'll provide an example, and then you can think of your own. If you prioritize self-care, how might that be interpreted as a sign of strength?

Patient: If I prioritize self-care, it could be seen as a sign of strength because it shows that I'm aware of my limits and willing to take steps to maintain my well-being. It means I'm not just pushing myself to the breaking point but trying to stay healthy and effective in the long run. 

For example, if I take a day off to recharge, it might actually make me more productive and present when I'm back at work, which benefits everyone.

Therapist: That's a great example, Marcus! Taking a day off to recharge is an act of self-awareness and strength because it shows that you're not just working non-stop without regard for your own needs. 

By prioritizing your well-being, you're investing in your ability to support others and be your best self in all aspects of your life. This is a sign of strength and resilience, not weakness.

I encourage you to keep this perspective in mind as you continue to practice self-care and challenge the belief that it's a sign of failure or weakness. You can add examples of your self-care habits and the positive outcomes that follow to your positive data log.

Now, let's shift our focus back to your experience in therapy. As we continue to explore and challenge your core beliefs and intermediate beliefs, I want to introduce a new technique called "behavioral experiments.".

Patient: Behavioral experiments sound interesting, Nova. Can you give me an example of how that might work in my situation? I'm not sure how to apply it to my life right now.

Therapist: Absolutely, Marcus! Behavioral experiments can be a great way to challenge your beliefs and gather evidence in a practical way. Let's brainstorm an experiment that relates to your belief of holding responsibility for everything.

Suppose you have a situation coming up where you're asked to take on an additional responsibility, like helping with another community project. We could set up an experiment where you practice setting a boundary and observing the outcome.

For example, you could practice saying something like, "I appreciate your invitation, but I'm currently at capacity with my commitments. I'm sure someone else could benefit from taking on this role." 

After setting the boundary, you can observe your thoughts and feelings, as well as the thoughts and feelings of the other person and the outcome of the situation. We can then discuss the evidence that supports or refutes your belief that you need to do it all.

Patient: That sounds like a practical way to test my beliefs, Nova. I can see how setting a boundary and observing the outcome could help me gather evidence about whether I really need to do it all or if others can step up too.

I'll definitely try that the next time I'm asked to take on an additional responsibility. It might be tough at first, but I'm willing to give it a shot and see what happens.

Therapist: I'm glad you find this approach helpful, Marcus. Remember, challenging long-held beliefs takes practice and patience, so be kind to yourself throughout the process.

Before we wrap up today's session, let's summarize what we've discussed. We explored the concept of self-care as an investment and how it relates to your belief of holding responsibility for everything. We also introduced the idea of behavioral experiments as a way to gather evidence and challenge your beliefs.

For homework this week, I'd like you to:

1. Practice using the "downward arrow" technique to identify your underlying beliefs related to holding responsibility for everything.
2. Create a positive data log to record evidence that challenges the belief that self-care and asking for help are signs of weakness or failure.
3. Conduct a behavioral experiment by setting a boundary and observing the outcome when asked to take on an additional responsibility.

How do you feel about these homework tasks, Marcus? Do you have any questions or concerns about implementing them this week?

Patient: I think these tasks are manageable, Nova. I'm a bit nervous about setting boundaries and conducting the behavioral experiment, but I understand the importance of challenging my beliefs.

I'll start with the downward arrow technique to dig deeper into my underlying beliefs. It might take some time, but I'm committed to doing it.

As for the positive data log, I'll keep track of instances where self-care has positively impacted my life and the lives of others. It'll be a good reminder that taking care of myself isn't a sign of weakness.

I'm ready to give it a try this week. Thanks for the guidance, Nova.
