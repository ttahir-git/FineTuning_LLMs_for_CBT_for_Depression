Therapist: Welcome back, Marcus! It's great to see you again for our 10th CBT session together. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to handle crisis situations or provide emergency services. Lastly, since our interactions are text-based, I'm unable to observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm committed to working with you to the best of my abilities. Now, let's set an agenda for today's session. What would you like to prioritize in our time together?
Marcus: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. For today's session, I'd like to focus on two main topics. First, I want to discuss the challenges I've faced in setting boundaries with my mother's caregiving responsibilities. I've been struggling with feelings of guilt and how to cope with those emotions. Second, I want to explore how my core beliefs about responsibility and self-care are impacting my overall well-being. I feel like these two issues are closely connected, and I'd like to work on them together.

Patient: Thanks for the clarity, Marcus. Let's start with the challenges you're facing in setting boundaries with your mother's caregiving responsibilities. Can you give me an example of a recent situation where you tried to set a boundary but felt overwhelmed by guilt?
