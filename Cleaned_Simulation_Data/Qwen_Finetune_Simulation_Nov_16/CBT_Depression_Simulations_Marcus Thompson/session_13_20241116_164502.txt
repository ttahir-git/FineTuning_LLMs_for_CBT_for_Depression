Therapist: Thank you for the summary, Marcus. It's helpful to understand the main topics we covered and the progress you've made. Before we dive into today's session, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues, which can impact the effectiveness of our interactions. With these limitations in mind, can you share what you've taken away from our last session and any questions or concerns you have about our work together?

Patient: Thanks for the heads-up about your limitations, Nova. It's good to know where you're coming from. From our last session, I think the biggest thing I took away was the idea of setting boundaries, especially when it comes to my mom. I've been feeling so guilty about not being there for her 24/7, but I'm starting to see that it's not realistic, and it's not fair to myself or my kids.

One thing that's been on my mind is how to actually put these boundaries into practice. Like, how do I tell my mom I can't be there every weekend without feeling like I'm abandoning her? And how do I balance that with my responsibilities at school and with my kids? I guess I'm looking for some practical steps or examples to help me figure that out.

Therapist: That's a great question, Marcus, and it's one that many people struggle with when it comes to setting boundaries, especially in complex family situations. Before we dive into that, let's do a check-in on your current mood and any changes you've noticed since our last session.

Patient: Sure, Nova. My mood's been a bit up and down lately. Some days, I feel like I'm juggling everything okay, but other days, it feels like everything's crashing down. I'd say on a scale of 1 to 10, my mood's been around a 5 or 6 most days. It's better than it was a few months ago, but there are still a lot of stressors.

Therapist: I appreciate you sharing that, Marcus. It's common for moods to fluctuate, especially when you're dealing with multiple stressors. That said, it's great that you're noticing some improvements, even if it's not always consistent. 

Now, let's go back to your question about setting boundaries. When we talk about setting boundaries, we're essentially talking about communicating your needs and limits to others in a way that's clear and assertive, while also respecting the rights of others. 

One way to start setting boundaries is to identify your needs and wants. In your case, it sounds like you need more time for self-care, relaxation, and managing your own stressors. You also want to be able to spend quality time with your kids and maintain your relationships with them. 

Let's focus on one specific situation where you want to set a boundary. Can you think of a time recently when you struggled to set a boundary with your mom, or with someone else?

Patient: Yeah, there was this one weekend when I had planned to take the kids to the park, but my mom called and said she needed help with some things around the house. I ended up canceling our plans and going to her place instead. The kids were disappointed, and I felt guilty about it, but I also felt like I couldn't say no to my mom.

Therapist: That's a great example, Marcus. Let's break this down a bit. What thoughts were going through your mind when your mom asked for help?

Patient: I guess I was thinking that I had to be there for her, that she's my mom and she needs me. I also felt like if I didn't go, she might feel abandoned or like I don't care about her.

Therapist: Those thoughts are understandable, given your strong love and respect for your mom. Now, let's look at the feelings behind those thoughts. What were you feeling in that moment, aside from guilt?

Patient: I was feeling stressed and anxious, like I was being pulled in two different directions. I also felt a bit resentful, like I wasn't getting a chance to do something I wanted to do with my kids.

Therapist: That's a good point. It's common for people to feel a mix of emotions in situations like this. Guilt, stress, and resentment are all normal reactions, especially when you're trying to balance caregiving responsibilities with other important aspects of your life.

Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought that you have to be there for your mom, no matter what. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?

Patient: Well, she's my mom, and she's been through a lot. She raised me on her own, and now she's dealing with Alzheimer's. I feel like it's my duty to be there for her, especially since I'm her only child.

Therapist: That's a great point. Your strong sense of family loyalty and duty is admirable. Now, what about evidence against the thought that you have to be there for your mom, no matter what?

Patient: I guess the evidence against it is that I have my own family now, and my kids need me too. I can't neglect them just because I feel like I have to be there for my mom all the time. It's not fair to them, and it's not fair to me either.

Therapist: Exactly. It's about finding a balance between your responsibilities to your family and your own needs and priorities. This is where setting boundaries comes in. 

Let's look at how you could phrase a boundary-setting statement for your mom. Remember, it's about communicating your needs in a clear, direct way while still showing respect for your mom's feelings. What might that look like in this situation?

Patient: Hmm, maybe something like, "Mom, I love you and I want to help, but I also need to spend time with my kids. How about we find a time during the week when I can come over and help you?" That way, I'm not saying no completely, but I'm also setting a boundary for myself.

Therapist: That's a great boundary-setting statement, Marcus! It's clear, direct, and shows respect for your mom's needs while also prioritizing your own. It's also important to be specific about the time when you can help, so there's no confusion.

Another important aspect of boundary-setting is to be consistent and follow through with your words. If you commit to helping your mom at a specific time, make sure you do it. This helps establish your boundaries as something that is reliable and trustworthy.

What do you think about that approach, Marcus? Can you imagine how you could use this strategy in other situations where you're struggling with boundaries?

Patient: Yeah, I think that makes sense. I can definitely see how this could help in other areas too, like with my ex-wife and co-parenting. Sometimes, we end up arguing over the kids because we both feel like we're not getting enough time with them. Maybe setting specific times for each of us to have the kids could help.

Therapist: That's a great idea, Marcus. Setting specific times for each parent to have the kids can help alleviate some of the stress and conflict that can come up in co-parenting situations. It's all about finding a balance that works for both you and your ex-partner, while also being fair to the kids.

Now, let's go back to the idea of self-care and managing your own stress. We've talked about the importance of setting boundaries and making time for your own needs, but what do you think are some of the main challenges you face in prioritizing self-care?

Patient: One of the main challenges is feeling guilty about taking time for myself. I always feel like I should be doing something productive, like helping someone else or working on a project for school. It's hard to justify taking a break when there's so much to do.

Therapist: That's a common feeling, Marcus. It's often said that self-care is about putting on your own oxygen mask first, but it can be hard to prioritize that when you feel like you have so many responsibilities and obligations. 

One way to start shifting that mindset is to reframe self-care as something that's not just a luxury, but a necessity. Taking time to recharge and care for yourself isn't selfish, it's actually essential for your overall well-being and ability to show up for others.

What do you think about that perspective, Marcus? Can you think of a time when taking care of yourself actually helped you be a better caregiver or parent?

Patient: You know, I remember last year when I took a weekend off to go to a jazz festival with some friends. At first, I felt guilty about it, but afterwards, I felt so refreshed and energized. I was able to come back to work and be more patient with my students, and even had more energy to help out at my mom's place. So, I guess you're right—taking care of myself does help me be a better caregiver in the long run.

Therapist: That's a great example, Marcus. It shows how taking a break and doing something that brings you joy and relaxation can actually improve your ability to support others. It's not about neglecting your responsibilities, it's about making sure you have the tools you need to be effective.

Another important thing to remember is that self-care doesn't have to be time-consuming or expensive. It can be something as simple as taking a few minutes to stretch, listening to music, or even just sitting quietly with your thoughts. The key is finding activities that work for you and incorporating them into your daily routine.

What do you think about that, Marcus? Can you think of one small self-care activity that you could try incorporating into your day-to-day life?

Patient: Hmm, maybe I could start by taking a few minutes each morning to sit quietly and just breathe. I usually rush out of the house as soon as I wake up, but maybe taking a few minutes to center myself could help me start the day off on a better note.

Therapist: That's a great idea, Marcus. Taking a few minutes to practice some deep breathing can help calm your mind and body, and set a positive tone for the rest of your day. It's a simple but powerful way to prioritize self-care.

Another thing to keep in mind is that self-care doesn't have to be a big, time-consuming task. It can be something as small as taking a walk around the block during your lunch break, or even just taking a moment to appreciate a beautiful sunset. The key is finding moments throughout the day where you can take a break and focus on your own needs.

What do you think about that, Marcus? Can you think of a small self-care activity that you could try incorporating into your day-to-day life?

Patient: Yeah, I think I could try taking a short walk during my lunch break. It would give me a chance to clear my head and get some fresh air, which I think would help me feel more focused and energized for the rest of the day.

Therapist: That's a great idea, Marcus. Taking a walk during your lunch break is a perfect example of a small, simple self-care activity that can make a big difference in your day. It's a way to get some light exercise, connect with nature, and give your mind a break from the stresses of school and work.

Another important thing to remember is that self-care is something that you can build into your routine over time. It doesn't have to be all or nothing—it's about finding moments throughout the day where you can prioritize your own needs.

What do you think about that, Marcus? Can you think of a few small self-care activities that you could try incorporating into your daily routine?

Patient: Yeah, I think I could also try listening to some jazz music while I'm grading papers or planning lessons. It might help me relax and focus better. And maybe I could also try to set aside a few minutes each evening to read a book or do something that I enjoy, just for myself.

Therapist: Those are all great ideas, Marcus. Listening to music is a great way to express and process emotions, and it can also help you relax and focus. And setting aside time each evening for a hobby or activity that you enjoy is a way to unwind and recharge after a long day.

It's about finding a balance between your responsibilities and your own needs. It's okay to take time for yourself, even if it's just for a few minutes a day.

Before we wrap up for today, let's do a quick check-in on how you're feeling now. How would you rate your mood on a scale of 1 to 10?

Patient: I'd say my mood is about a 6 or 7 right now. I feel a bit more hopeful after talking about these self-care ideas, but I still have a lot on my mind.

Therapist: That's good to hear, Marcus. It's okay to still have some stress and concerns. The fact that you're feeling more hopeful and open to the idea of self-care is a positive sign.

For homework this week, I'd like you to try incorporating at least one self-care activity into your daily routine. It could be something as simple as taking a walk or listening to music. The goal is to start building self-care into your routine, and see how it impacts your mood and overall well-being.

We'll come back to this topic in our next session and see how it's been working for you. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to bring them up.

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a try. I think the walk during lunch break and the jazz music while working are good starting points. I'll let you know how it goes next time.
