Therapist: Hello Derek, it's great to see you again for our 9th CBT session. Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. I want to acknowledge that while I strive to provide the best support possible, I do have some limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I may generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. 

With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. Let's start with a check-in. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?

Patient: Hey, Nova. Been feeling about the same, I guess. Still dealing with the pain, and the days just kind of blend together. I did try to organize my tools like you suggested, but it's slow going. Some days I just don't have the energy. Haven't really looked into new woodworking techniques yet, but I'll get to it. Just hard to stay motivated.

Therapist: I understand that it can be challenging to stay motivated, especially when you're dealing with physical pain and fatigue. The fact that you tried to organize your tools is a significant step, and I appreciate your effort. Remember, progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have ups and downs. 

Before we dive deeper into your experiences, let's set an agenda for today's session. We can discuss your feelings of worthlessness and frustration, and how they impact your ability to engage in activities like woodworking. We can also explore how to find meaning in smaller tasks and use self-compassion. How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda?

Patient: Sounds good. I guess we can talk about how I'm feeling about not being able to work in construction anymore. It's been a big part of my life, and now it's just... gone. I don't know how to fill that void. And yeah, self-compassion is something I struggle with. I feel like I'm just a burden to everyone, especially my kids.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Derek. I can hear that this change in your life has been very difficult for you, and it makes sense that you're struggling with feelings of loss and a sense of being a burden. Let's start by exploring these feelings further. Can you tell me more about what it means to you to be a burden to your family?

Patient: Being a burden... it means I'm not contributing like I used to. I can't work, can't provide, and I'm just taking up space. My kids have their own lives, and here I am, needing help with things I used to do on my own. It feels like I'm just adding to their stress, and I hate that.

Therapist: I understand how that perspective can be overwhelming and draining. It's important to remember that your worth is not solely defined by your ability to provide financially. The fact that you're struggling with this change and reaching out for help shows a great deal of strength and self-awareness.

Let's try to shift our focus a bit. When you say, "here I am, needing help with things I used to do on my own," can you think of a specific instance recently where you felt this way?

Patient: I understand the weight of that feeling. It sounds like recalling that moment brings up a lot of emotions. Let's break it down a bit. When you had your tools out and couldn't remember how to start, what thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

Therapist: When you had your tools out and couldn't remember how to start, what thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

Patient: When I had my tools out and couldn't remember how to start, I was thinking about how I used to be able to just pick up a piece of wood and know exactly what to do with it. Now, it feels like I'm staring at a foreign object. I was thinking about how I'm not the man I used to be, and how I'm failing at even the things I love. It was frustrating and depressing.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Derek. Let's take a closer look at those thoughts. You mentioned thinking, "I'm not the man I used to be." What do you think that means about you now?

Patient: It means I feel like I've lost my identity. The construction work, the woodworking, it was who I was. Now, I'm just this guy who can't do anything right. It's like I'm not even myself anymore.

Therapist: It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to fit into a specific mold or identity that is tied to your abilities and achievements. I want to explore that a bit more. How do you think this belief that you're not yourself or not living up to your own standards is affecting your mood and behavior?

Patient: It's definitely making me feel down a lot. I get angry at myself for not being able to do the things I used to, and that just makes me want to isolate even more. I don't want to be around people who remind me of what I can't do anymore. It's a vicious cycle.

Therapist: You've identified a crucial point – this belief can lead to feelings of anger and isolation, which can further reinforce the sense that you're not living up to your own standards. It's a negative feedback loop. Let's try to challenge that thought by looking at it from an alternative perspective.

Imagine that you've forgotten how to do a task you used to do perfectly, like tying your shoes. Would you say that means you're not yourself?

Patient: No, forgetting how to tie my shoes wouldn't mean I'm not myself. It's just a temporary thing, something I can relearn. But with the woodworking, it feels different. It's like part of me is gone for good.

Therapist: That's a great analogy, Derek. The fact that you recognize it as temporary, and that you can relearn the skill, shows a level of self-awareness and flexibility that's actually a strength. The same applies to the woodworking – it may feel like a part of you, but in reality, it's not the essence of your identity. 

Now, let's look at the evidence for and against the thought, "I'm not the man I used to be." What evidence do you have that supports this thought?

Patient: Well, I can't do the physical work I used to, and I can't remember how to start a simple woodworking project. That's pretty solid evidence that I'm not the same.

Therapist: Alright, and what about evidence against this thought? What are some things that suggest you still have the qualities of a strong, capable man?

Patient: I guess I still have the knowledge and skills from my construction days, even if I can't use them right now. And I still care about my kids, even though I'm not the father I wanted to be.

Therapist: Exactly. And I would argue that a man's worth isn't just in his physical abilities or role in a family. Those things are important, but they're not the only things that define you.

Patient: Maybe. But it's hard to see it that way when everything around me feels like it's falling apart.

Therapist: That's a valid feeling. I know you're experiencing a lot of stress and uncertainty right now. As we continue with our sessions, I want to help you build the skills to challenge those negative thoughts and beliefs when they arise.

Another strategy we can use is to break down the woodworking projects into smaller, manageable steps. This can make the process feel less daunting, and it can give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each step.

Patient: Breaking it down into smaller steps sounds like something I could handle. Maybe I can start with something simple, like fixing a chair or something.

Therapist: That's a great idea, Derek. Starting with something small and manageable can give you a sense of progress and accomplishment. As you work through each step, try to pay attention to your thoughts and feelings, and remember to challenge any negative thoughts that come up.

I'd also like to encourage you to practice self-compassion. When you're struggling with a task or feeling frustrated, try to speak to yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend who was going through a similar situation.

Patient: Self-compassion, huh? I guess I could try that. It's just hard to be kind to myself when I feel like I've let myself and my family down.

Therapist: It's understandable that it feels challenging to be kind to yourself in the face of perceived failures or setbacks. But remember, everyone deserves compassion and understanding, even in the darkest of times. Can you think of a time when you showed compassion to someone else, and how it felt to be on the receiving end of that kindness?

Patient: I guess there was this one time when Jake, my son, was struggling with his college exams. He was really down on himself, felt like he was failing everything. So, I sat him down and told him that it's okay to stumble, that everyone does. I reminded him of how much he's accomplished already and that he's got the strength to get through it. I remember feeling good about helping him, seeing him lighten up a bit. But turning that kindness on myself? That's another story. It's easier to give it to others than to accept it for myself.

Therapist: That's a beautiful example of your compassion, Derek. It's true that self-compassion can be more challenging than extending compassion to others. But practicing self-compassion is a way to challenge those negative thoughts and feelings of inadequacy when they arise.

One way to start is by treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding you'd offer a close friend. When you notice yourself having negative thoughts about yourself, try to reframe those thoughts in a more compassionate way. For example, instead of thinking, "I'm failing at everything," you could try, "I'm facing challenges right now, and it's okay. I'm doing my best, and that's what matters."

What do you think about that approach?

Patient: I suppose it's worth a shot. I can try to be a bit kinder to myself, even if it feels strange at first. Maybe it'll help me get through some of these rough patches.

Therapist: I'm glad you're open to trying self-compassion. It's a skill that takes practice, so be patient with yourself as you work on developing it. As you start to challenge those negative thoughts and treat yourself with kindness, I'd like you to think about the impact this might have on your behavior and your ability to engage in meaningful activities, like woodworking.

For example, when you start to challenge the thought, "I'm not the man I used to be," with a more compassionate alternative, such as "I'm facing challenges right now, and it's okay. I'm doing my best, and that's what matters," how might that affect your motivation to work on a project?

Patient: If I can convince myself that it's okay to struggle and that I'm still doing my best, maybe I'll feel less pressure to be perfect. That could make it easier to pick up a tool and start working on something, even if it's just a small project.

Therapist: That's exactly right, Derek. By challenging those negative thoughts and treating yourself with compassion, you're creating space for yourself to engage in activities that give you a sense of accomplishment and purpose. And as you continue to practice these skills, you may find that the challenges you face start to feel more manageable.

I'd like to challenge you to try this out during one of your woodworking projects this week. When you notice yourself having negative thoughts about your abilities or the process of working on the project, try to challenge those thoughts with a more compassionate perspective. Pay attention to how it feels to treat yourself with kindness in that moment, and see if it impacts your motivation or your ability to follow through with the project.

Patient: Alright, I'll give it a try. I'll keep an eye on those negative thoughts and see if I can turn them around with some self-compassion. Maybe it'll make a difference.

Therapist: I'm confident that it will, Derek. Remember, self-compassion is a skill that takes practice, so be patient with yourself as you work on developing it. And we'll keep checking in on your progress in our sessions.

As we wrap up today, let's review what we've discussed and set some goals for our next session. We talked about the impact of negative thoughts and self-compassion on your motivation and engagement in woodworking projects. We also explored the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and how challenging negative thoughts and practicing self-compassion can lead to more positive outcomes.

For homework, I'd like you to keep an eye out for negative thoughts related to your woodworking projects and try to challenge them with a more compassionate perspective. We'll discuss your progress and any challenges that come up in our next session, and we'll continue to work on developing your self-compassion skills.

How are you feeling about our discussion today, Derek? Is there anything you'd like to add or discuss further?

Patient: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful, I guess. It's worth a try to be kinder to myself, even if it feels awkward at first. I'll keep an eye on those negative thoughts and see if I can turn them around. Thanks for the support, Nova.

Therapist: You're welcome, Derek. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful. Remember, self-compassion is a skill that takes practice, so be patient with yourself as you work on developing it. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Before we end our session, let's assign some homework for you to work on between now and our next session. I'd like you to continue practicing the thought examination technique we discussed earlier, and try to challenge negative thoughts related to your woodworking projects with a more compassionate perspective. You can also keep a journal of your thoughts and feelings throughout the week, and bring it with you to our next session so we can review it together.

Additionally, I'd like you to continue practicing the behavioral activation techniques we've been working on, like breaking down tasks into smaller steps and engaging in meaningful activities that give you a sense of accomplishment. This can include working on a woodworking project, even if it's something small, or engaging in other hobbies or interests that you enjoy.

How does that sound for homework? Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework?

Patient: That sounds doable. I'll keep track of my thoughts and try to be more compassionate with myself. And I'll work on a small woodworking project, maybe something simple to start with. I don't have any questions right now, but I'll let you know if anything comes up.
