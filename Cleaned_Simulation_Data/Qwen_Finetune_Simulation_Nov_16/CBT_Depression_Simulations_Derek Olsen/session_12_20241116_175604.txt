Therapist: Hello Derek, it's good to see you again for our 12th CBT session. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, such as mistranslating something from another language. Additionally, I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Hey, Nova. I'm alright, I guess. Just the usual, you know? Pain's been kicking up a bit, but nothing new there. How's it going with you?

Therapist: I understand that the pain has been affecting you, and we can definitely discuss that further. I also want to acknowledge the progress you've been making, even if it feels small at times. Your willingness to engage in therapy and try new coping strategies, despite the challenges you face, is a testament to your strength and resilience. 

For today's session, I thought we could start by reviewing your homework from the last meeting. We can discuss how you did with cleaning and organizing your woodworking tools, planning a small project, and keeping track of your negative thoughts and challenging them. 

I also want to introduce a new technique called "behavioral activation" that can help you engage in activities that bring you a sense of accomplishment or pleasure, despite your depression. This can be a great way to counteract the avoidance and withdrawal that often accompany depression.

How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our agenda for today?

Patient: Yeah, I did clean up the tools a bit. It wasn't easy, but I managed. As for the project, I got a small shelf idea in my head, but I haven't started it yet. The negative thoughts, well, I wrote some down, but I'm not sure how to challenge them. 

Behavioral activation sounds interesting. I could use something to feel like I'm accomplishing something, even if it's small. What exactly does that involve?

Therapist: That's a great start, Derek. Even a small amount of progress is significant, and it's a step in the right direction. 

Regarding the shelf project, you can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, you could start by gathering materials or researching how-tos. The key is to focus on the process and celebrate each small victory along the way.

As for challenging negative thoughts, it's a skill that takes practice. One technique we can use is called "thought challenging" or "cognitive restructuring." It involves identifying negative thoughts, evaluating the evidence for and against them, and then generating more balanced and realistic thoughts.

For example, if you have the thought, "I'll never be able to complete this project," you might challenge that by reminding yourself of past accomplishments or breaking the project down into smaller steps. We can work on this together, and I'll provide you with some tools to use when you're in the process of challenging your thoughts.

What do you think about these ideas? Do you have any questions or concerns?

Patient: Alright, breaking down the project into smaller steps makes sense. I can try that. As for the thought challenging, I get the idea, but it sounds like a lot of work. I'll give it a shot, though. 

What kind of tools are we talking about? And how do I know if I'm doing it right?

Therapist: That's a great question, Derek. When it comes to thought challenging, there are a few tools you can use to help you evaluate your thoughts more objectively. One tool is a "thought record," which is a worksheet that helps you capture the situation, your emotions, the negative thoughts you're having, and then the evidence for and against those thoughts.

Another tool is a "worry time" or designated time each day when you intentionally focus on challenging your negative thoughts, rather than letting them drift through your mind throughout the day. During this time, you might write down your thoughts, evaluate the evidence, and generate more balanced alternatives.

As for knowing if you're doing it right, it's all about practice and self-reflection. You might not always get it perfect, but the key is to keep trying and be open to learning from the process. We can work on this together, and I'll provide you with some examples and guidance along the way.

How does that sound? Do you have any other questions or concerns about the techniques we've discussed so far?

Patient: Alright, the thought record and worry time sound like something I can try. I'll give it a shot and see how it goes. 

As for the project, I'll start with gathering materials. That seems doable. 

Anything else we need to cover today?

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan, Derek. I think the steps we've discussed so far should be a good starting point for you to work on between now and our next session.

Before we wrap up, I want to check in with you about your current mood and any final thoughts you might have from our discussion today. How are you feeling at this moment?

Patient: I'm feeling a bit better, I guess. It's good to have a plan, even if it's just small steps. I'll try to stick to it and see how it goes. 

Anything else you need from me before we finish up?
