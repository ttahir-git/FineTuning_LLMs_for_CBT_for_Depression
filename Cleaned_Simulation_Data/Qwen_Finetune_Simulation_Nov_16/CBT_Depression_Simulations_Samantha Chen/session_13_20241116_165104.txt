Therapist: Hello Samantha, it's great to see you again for your 13th CBT session. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. There's also a potential for me to generate inaccurate information or misinterpret something you say. Additionally, as an AI, I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Thank you for the acknowledgment, Nova. I appreciate your transparency. Today, I'm feeling a mix of emotions. On one hand, I'm still anxious about the business and the financial pressure. On the other hand, I've been trying to practice more self-compassion, especially with the loving-kindness meditation you suggested last time. It's been helping a bit, but I still find myself slipping back into old patterns of self-criticism. How do I keep that balance between pushing myself and being kind to myself?

Therapist: It's understandable that you're still feeling anxious about your business and finances, and it's great that you've been trying to practice self-compassion. The struggle to maintain balance between self-compassion and self-motivation is a common challenge. As we work on building self-compassion, it's essential to recognize that it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps. Remember, you can apply self-compassion in the context of self-motivation by acknowledging your achievements and progress while also treating yourself with kindness when you face challenges. Would you like to explore this further?

Patient: Yes, I would like to explore this further. It's hard for me to see my achievements sometimes, especially when I'm so focused on what's not going perfectly. Can you give me an example of how I might apply self-compassion in a situation where I'm feeling overwhelmed by my business?

Therapist: Certainly, let's consider a recent situation where you felt overwhelmed with your business. Can you walk me through the incident and what thoughts and emotions came up for you?

### Explanation:
When you're feeling overwhelmed by your business, it's essential to remember that it's normal to have those feelings. You're facing challenges, and it's okay to feel the way you do. However, it's crucial to treat yourself with compassion and understanding. Here's an example of how you can apply self-compassion in that situation:

1. Acknowledge your feelings: Recognize that you're feeling overwhelmed and give yourself permission to feel that way. You might say to yourself, "It's understandable that I feel overwhelmed right now, given all the challenges I'm facing with my business."

2. Remind yourself of your strengths: Reflect on your past successes and the skills you've developed in your career. You might think, "I've overcome challenges before, and I have a strong foundation of experience and knowledge that will help me navigate this difficult time."

3. Practice kindness towards yourself: Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer a good friend. You might say, "I'm doing my best, and that's enough. I don't need to be perfect, but I can be kind and supportive of myself."

By applying self-compassion in this way, you acknowledge your feelings, remind yourself of your strengths, and offer kindness towards yourself. This can help you maintain a balanced perspective and support your progress in your business.

Patient: Thank you for the explanation, Nova. It makes sense to acknowledge my feelings and remind myself of my strengths. I remember a recent situation where I was working on a new clothing design and felt like it wasn't perfect. I ended up redoing it multiple times and missed a deadline. I felt like a failure and started doubting my abilities.

Using your example, I could acknowledge that feeling overwhelmed is normal in that situation. I could remind myself that I have a strong background in design and business, and that I've successfully launched other projects before. Finally, I could practice kindness towards myself by saying, "I'm doing my best, and that's enough. I don't need to be perfect, but I can be kind and supportive of myself."

It's still hard for me to fully believe that, but I'll try to practice this more often.

Therapist: It's great that you're willing to try applying self-compassion to that situation. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps. You're making progress by recognizing the importance of self-compassion and trying to apply it in your life.

As we continue our work together, we'll explore more ways to build self-compassion and develop a more balanced perspective. I'm here to support you throughout this journey.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support. I'll keep practicing self-compassion and try to be more gentle with myself. It's a work in progress, but I'm hopeful that it will help me manage my anxiety better.
