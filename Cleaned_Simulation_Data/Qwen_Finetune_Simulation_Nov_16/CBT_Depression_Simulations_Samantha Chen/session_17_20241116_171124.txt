Therapist: Welcome back, Samantha! Thank you for sharing the summary of our previous session. I want to acknowledge that as an AI, I have some limitations. I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you share with me in our sessions. There's also a possibility that I might generate inaccurate information at times. Additionally, I'm not equipped to provide crisis intervention or emergency services, and I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. However, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities within these constraints. 

Now, let's dive into our session. I'd like to start by checking in with you. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any significant changes or experiences you'd like to share?

Patient: Thank you for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. It's good to keep that in mind.

Since our last session, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. The fashion show is coming up in two weeks, and the anxiety about it has been pretty intense. I've been trying to break down the tasks as we discussed, but I find myself getting stuck on small details and redoing things multiple times. It's exhausting.

On the positive side, I did draft an email to my parents about the business situation. It wasn't perfect, but I sent it anyway. I haven't heard back yet, which is both a relief and a source of worry. I'm trying to practice self-compassion when I catch myself being too critical, but it's still a work in progress.

Overall, I'm managing, but there are days when the weight of everything feels overwhelming.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Samantha. It's common to experience a range of emotions, especially when facing a significant event like a fashion show. The fact that you're recognizing and naming your emotions, even if they're overwhelming at times, is a crucial part of the process.

I'm glad to hear that you drafted an email to your parents, even though it wasn't perfect. Remembering that perfection isn't the goal is an important part of self-compassion. It's okay to take small steps and be your own source of understanding and support.

Regarding the fashion show, it sounds like you've been working on breaking down the tasks, but you're finding yourself getting stuck on small details. This is something we can continue to work on together. Perfectionism can be a significant barrier to progress, and we can explore ways to challenge those thoughts and behaviors.

For today's session, I'd like to suggest a few topics based on what you've shared. We could explore some distress tolerance techniques to help manage the overwhelming emotions, discuss your experiences with the fashion show and self-compassion, and brainstorm ways to communicate with your parents. What feels most important to focus on today?

Patient: I think focusing on managing the overwhelming emotions around the fashion show would be most helpful right now. The anxiety is really starting to take a toll on me, and I could use some strategies to cope with it better. Also, if we could touch on self-compassion, that would be great. I'm still struggling with being too hard on myself, especially when things don't go perfectly.

Therapist: Let's start by discussing some distress tolerance techniques that you can use to manage the overwhelming emotions related to the fashion show. One effective technique is called "grounding." Grounding helps you stay present in the moment and can be useful when you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious.

One simple grounding exercise is to focus on your senses. Take a moment to notice five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This practice can help bring your focus back to the present and away from the anxious thoughts.

Another technique is deep breathing. Taking slow, deep breaths can help calm your body's physical response to anxiety. You can try inhaling for a count of four, holding the breath for a count of four, and then exhaling for a count of four. Repeat this cycle a few times, and you may find your body starting to feel more relaxed.

What do you think about incorporating some of these techniques into your coping strategy? Can you imagine using them in the moments when anxiety feels overwhelming?

Patient: Those grounding techniques sound really helpful, especially the one about focusing on my senses. I can see how that would help bring me back to the present moment and away from the anxious thoughts. I think I could definitely use that during the days leading up to the fashion show, especially when I start feeling overwhelmed by all the details.

The deep breathing exercise is something I've tried before, but I haven't been consistent with it. Maybe if I set a reminder on my phone to do it a few times a day, I could build it into my routine. It might help me stay calmer throughout the day, not just when I'm feeling anxious.

I'm willing to give these techniques a try and see how they work for me. It's worth a shot, especially if it helps me manage the anxiety better.

Therapist: I'm glad you find the grounding techniques and deep breathing helpful. Setting reminders for deep breathing can be a great way to build it into your daily routine, which can make it more consistent and easier to remember when you need it.

Another important aspect of managing anxiety is self-care. Engaging in activities that you enjoy and that help you feel grounded can be a powerful tool in reducing anxiety levels. This could include things like spending time in nature, listening to music, or engaging in a hobby like photography.

Remember, self-care doesn't have to be time-consuming or complicated. Even small moments of self-care throughout the day can make a difference in how you feel overall.

What are some self-care activities that you enjoy or find helpful? We could discuss incorporating them into your daily routine, especially during times when anxiety is running high.

Patient: Self-care activities that I enjoy include yoga, which I've been doing regularly for a few years now. It helps me feel more centered and grounded. I also love spending time in my organic garden; it's a peaceful escape where I can focus on something other than work and stress.

Lately, I've been trying to incorporate more mindful moments into my day, like taking a few minutes to sit quietly and just breathe. It's not always easy to find the time, but I know it's important for my mental health.

I think adding these self-care activities to my routine, especially during the days leading up to the fashion show, could really help me manage the anxiety better. It's about finding that balance between work and taking care of myself.

Therapist: It's great that you have a range of self-care activities that you enjoy, from yoga and gardening to mindful moments of breathing. Incorporating these activities into your daily routine can make a significant difference in managing anxiety and stress levels.

As you prepare for the fashion show, I encourage you to prioritize self-care, especially during the moments when anxiety feels overwhelming. Remember, self-care isn't selfish â€“ it's an essential part of maintaining your mental health and well-being.

I'd like to explore how we can incorporate some of these techniques and self-care activities into your daily routine. For example, you could start your day with a brief yoga or mindful breathing practice to help set a calming tone. Or, you could schedule time in your garden or for photography during the evenings, after your work responsibilities have been completed.

What are some specific ways you think you could incorporate self-care into your routine before the fashion show?

Patient: I think starting my day with a brief yoga session or mindful breathing practice would be really helpful. It would set a calming tone for the rest of the day, which is especially important when I'm feeling anxious about the fashion show. I could also schedule a short break in the afternoon to step outside and spend some time in my garden. It's a peaceful place where I can recharge and clear my mind.

In the evenings, I could make it a habit to do something creative, like sketching new clothing designs or working on my photography. It would be a nice way to unwind and shift my focus away from work and stress.

I think these small, consistent self-care activities could really make a difference in how I feel leading up to the fashion show. It's about finding those moments of peace and balance throughout the day.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you have a plan for incorporating self-care activities into your routine. Starting your day with a calming practice like yoga or mindful breathing can make a big difference in setting a positive tone for the rest of the day. Scheduling breaks in your garden during the afternoon can provide the much-needed relief and relaxation.

In the evenings, engaging in creative activities like sketching or photography can serve as a healthy outlet for stress relief and an opportunity to express your artistic side. It's important to find a balance between work and self-expression, so it's great that you're making space for these activities.

As you work on incorporating these self-care strategies into your routine, remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself. It's okay if things don't go perfectly all the time. The important thing is that you're making an effort to prioritize your mental health and well-being.

I'd like to explore how you can communicate this to your parents about the business situation. Earlier, you mentioned that you're struggling to communicate with them. What thoughts and feelings come up for you when you try to discuss this with them?

Patient: When I try to discuss the business situation with my parents, I feel a mix of emotions. There's a lot of guilt and fear of disappointing them. They've always had high expectations for me, and I know they see this career change as a step backward. I worry that they'll think I'm being reckless or ungrateful for the opportunities they've provided.

There's also a sense of frustration because I feel like they don't understand my passion for sustainable fashion and the importance of making a positive impact on the environment. It's hard to communicate that this business isn't just about making money; it's about making a difference.

I want them to be proud of me, but I also want them to respect my choices and understand that this is something I truly believe in. It's a delicate balance, and I often feel like I'm walking on eggshells when we talk about it.

Therapist: It sounds like the conversation with your parents involves a lot of complex emotions and a delicate balance of expressing yourself while maintaining your relationship with them. It's understandable that you feel guilty, afraid, and frustrated when discussing the business situation.

Let's explore some ways to communicate more effectively with your parents while still expressing your feelings and beliefs about sustainable fashion. One technique that can be helpful is using "I" statements. This involves expressing your thoughts and feelings in a non-blaming way, which can make it easier for the other person to hear you and understand your perspective.

For example, instead of saying, "You don't understand what I'm doing with the business," you could say, "I feel like my parents may not fully understand my passion for sustainable fashion and the impact I'm trying to make."

Using "I" statements can help avoid putting your parents on the defensive and create a more open dialogue. Another important aspect is to express gratitude and appreciation for your parents' support, even if it doesn't necessarily align with your business decisions. This can help show that you still value your relationship with them.

What do you think about using "I" statements and expressing gratitude in your conversations with your parents? How do you think that might help you communicate more effectively?

Patient: Using "I" statements and expressing gratitude sounds like a good approach. It might help me communicate more effectively by making my feelings and beliefs clearer without sounding accusatory. I think it could also help my parents see that I'm not just being reckless; I'm trying to make a meaningful impact with my business.

Expressing gratitude for their support, even if it doesn't align with my decisions, could help soften the conversation and show that I still value their opinions and the opportunities they've provided. It's about finding a way to bridge the gap between our perspectives and maintain a positive relationship.

I'll try to practice using "I" statements and expressing gratitude the next time we talk about the business. It might take some time to get used to, but I think it could make a difference in how the conversation goes.

Therapist: I'm glad you find the use of "I" statements and expressing gratitude helpful. It's great that you're willing to practice these skills and apply them in your conversations with your parents. It does take practice, but over time, it can make a big difference in the quality of your communication and the outcomes of these discussions.

As you practice using these techniques, remember that it's okay if the conversation doesn't go perfectly the first time. Be patient with yourself and keep trying. You can always revisit the conversation and continue the dialogue as needed, using the skills you've been practicing.

I'd also like to explore some of the thoughts and beliefs that might be contributing to your anxiety and guilt around the business situation. Let's use a technique called the "downward arrow" to uncover some of the deeper beliefs that might be driving your emotions. This involves asking yourself a series of questions to get to the root of your thoughts.

For example, if you're worried that your parents will think you're being reckless, you could ask yourself, "If that's true, what would that mean to me?" The goal is to get to a deeper belief that's driving the initial thought and emotion.

Let's try this technique together. Can you think of another thought or concern you have about the business situation?

Patient: Another thought I have about the business situation is that I'm constantly worried about failing and letting everyone down, especially my partner and my parents. If I were to fail, I think it would mean that I'm not good enough and that I've wasted all the opportunities and support they've given me.

Using the downward arrow technique, I could ask myself, "If I fail, what would that mean to me?" and then continue to dig deeper. So, if I fail, it would mean that I'm not good enough, which would then mean that I've let everyone down and wasted their support. It's a cycle of negative thoughts that feed into my anxiety and guilt.

Therapist: It sounds like the deeper belief driving your thoughts around the business situation is that if you fail, it means you're not good enough and you've wasted the opportunities and support given to you. This belief could be contributing to your anxiety and guilt, and it's something we can work on challenging and reframing.

One way to start challenging this belief is to look for evidence that contradicts it. For example, you could think about times in your life when you've faced challenges and learned from them, rather than seeing them as failures. This could include your experiences with your business, your gender transition, and even your academic pursuits.

Another way to challenge this belief is to consider what you would say to a friend or loved one in a similar situation. If a friend expressed the same concerns, what would you tell them? Often, we're kinder and more understanding with others than we are with ourselves.

What are some other ways you could challenge this belief that if you fail, you're not good enough?

Patient: One way I could challenge this belief is by reminding myself of the progress I've already made with GreenThread. Even if the business doesn't become a huge success, I've learned a lot and grown as a person. I've taken risks and stepped out of my comfort zone, which is something to be proud of.

Another way is to focus on the positive impact I'm making, even if it's small. Every eco-friendly garment I create is a step towards a more sustainable future, and that's something valuable in itself. It's not just about the financial success; it's about the difference I'm trying to make.

I could also talk to my partner and friends about their perspectives. They might have different views on what success looks like and how to measure it. Their support and encouragement could help me see things from a different angle and challenge my negative beliefs.

Therapist: Those are great ways to challenge the belief that if you fail, you're not good enough. Celebrating the progress you've made and the positive impact you're making is so important, especially in a field where it's easy to get fixated on financial success.

It's also a great idea to talk to your partner, friends, and even trusted colleagues about their perspectives. Their support and encouragement can help you see things from a different angle and challenge the negative beliefs you've been holding onto.

As we continue to work on reframing this belief, remember that making mistakes or facing challenges is a part of the learning process. It doesn't define your worth or value as a person.

Patient: Thank you, Nova. I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll make sure to keep these strategies in mind and continue to challenge those negative beliefs. It's important to remember that making mistakes and facing challenges are part of the journey, and they don't define my worth.

I'll also make an effort to talk to my partner and friends about their perspectives on success and failure. Their support and different viewpoints could really help me gain a more balanced perspective.

I feel a bit more hopeful and empowered after this session. I'll keep practicing these techniques and see how they work in my daily life.
