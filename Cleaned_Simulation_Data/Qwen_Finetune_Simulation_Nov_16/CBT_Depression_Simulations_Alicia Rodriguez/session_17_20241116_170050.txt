Therapist: Welcome back, Alicia! I'm glad to see you again for our 17th CBT session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide support and guidance based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. Lastly, I can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you to the best of my abilities. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Thanks for the reminder about your limitations, Nova. It's good to know what to expect. 

Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to the homework you gave me. I've been leaving work by 6:00pm most days, which has been really hard. I feel guilty every time I leave, like I'm letting my team down. But I've also been scheduling an hour of self-care each evening, which has helped a bit. I've been reading more sci-fi novels and doing some salsa dancing at home. It's been a nice escape, but I still feel really tired and anxious a lot of the time.

I've also been journaling about my thoughts and challenges, like you suggested. It's been helpful to see how often I have negative assumptions about what others think of me. But I'm still struggling to challenge those thoughts effectively. Can we talk more about that today?

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you've been making progress with the homework, Alicia. It's common to feel guilty and exhausted when starting to prioritize self-care, but it's great that you're noticing the benefits in your mood and activities.

Let's definitely spend some time today discussing strategies for challenging negative thoughts. We can also explore how setting boundaries at work might be affecting your relationships and self-perception. How does that sound for our agenda today?

Patient: That sounds good. I'm really curious to learn more about how to challenge these negative thoughts. It feels like they're always there, lurking in the background, making me doubt myself. And I'm also interested in how setting boundaries at work might be affecting my relationships. I've noticed some of my colleagues seem a bit distant lately, and I'm not sure if it's related.

Therapist: Those are great points to explore, Alicia. We can start by looking at the evidence for and against your negative thoughts, and then practice reframing them in a more balanced way. We can also discuss how setting boundaries at work might be affecting your relationships, and explore ways to navigate those challenges.

Let's start with an example of a negative thought you've been having lately. Can you share one that's been particularly distressing for you?

Patient: Certainly. Lately, I've been having a thought that I don't deserve my promotion because I'm not experienced enough compared to my peers. It's been especially distressing because it makes me feel like I'm constantly on the verge of being "found out" as incompetent.

Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Alicia. Let's examine this thought using the evidence-gathering technique we've discussed before. Can you think of some evidence that supports this thought that you deserve your promotion but aren't experienced enough?

Patient: Well, I can think of a few things. For example, I've only been at the company for two years, and some of my peers have been here for five or more. I also haven't led a team before, so I worry that I'm not prepared for the responsibilities that come with being a team lead.

Therapist: Okay, those are valid concerns. Now, let's look at evidence against this thought. What are some reasons why you might deserve the promotion, regardless of your experience level?

Patient: Hmm, that's a tougher one. I guess I could say that I've consistently met and exceeded my performance goals since I started at the company. My manager has also mentioned that my problem-solving skills and ability to innovate are some of the reasons I was promoted. Plus, I've been taking on additional responsibilities and mentoring junior developers, which shows that I'm capable of leadership.

Therapist: Great job identifying that evidence, Alicia. It's important to recognize that your contributions to the company extend beyond just your experience level. Now, let's try to reframe your initial thought in a more balanced way. Based on the evidence for and against, how could you look at this situation differently?

Patient: I suppose I could think of it as a chance to grow and learn as a leader, rather than feeling like I'm not qualified. It's true that I don't have as much experience as some of my peers, but I have other strengths that make me a good fit for the role. Maybe it's not about being "experienced enough" but about being willing to learn and adapt.

Therapist: That's a great reframe, Alicia. You're acknowledging that leadership is an ongoing process, and that your strengths are valuable regardless of your experience level. Let's practice using this reframe when you notice the negative thought popping up. It can be helpful to write down the alternative perspective and refer back to it when you're feeling doubtful.

Patient: Thanks, I'll definitely try that. It's helpful to have a concrete way to challenge those thoughts when they come up.

Therapist: Absolutely. It's a skill that takes practice, but the more you do it, the easier it becomes. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about the impact of setting boundaries at work on your relationships. Have you noticed any changes in your interactions with your colleagues since you started leaving on time and taking dedicated self-care breaks?

Patient: Actually, yes. I've noticed that when I leave on time, I feel less stressed and more present when I do interact with my colleagues. It's also helped me to be more patient and less irritable, which I think has improved our working relationships.

Therapist: That's great to hear, Alicia. Setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care can have a big impact on your interactions with others. It's wonderful that you're noticing those positive changes. Have you talked to any of your colleagues about your experience?

Patient: Not directly, but I think they've noticed the difference. I've had a few coworkers mention that they appreciate my more relaxed demeanor lately, which feels good to hear.

Therapist: That's a great example of how your behavior can influence others positively. It's also an opportunity for you to challenge your assumption that others will be judgmental of your new boundaries. What do you think about talking directly to your colleagues about your experience and how they've responded?

Patient: I think it could be a good idea. It might help me feel more supported and understood, and it could also encourage others to set their own boundaries. I'll consider bringing it up next time we have a team meeting.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Remember, it's okay to advocate for yourself and your needs. And even if there's some initial uncertainty or concern, it's not a sign that you're being judged, but rather an opportunity to educate others about the benefits of setting boundaries.

Now, let's take a moment to check in on your emotional state. How are you feeling after our discussion today?

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful, actually. It's nice to have these conversations and realize that I'm not alone in feeling this way. It's also reassuring to know that I can make changes that positively impact both my work and personal life.

Therapist: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more hopeful, Alicia. It's a testament to the work you've been doing and the insights you've gained from our discussions.

As we wrap up today's session, let's assign some homework to help you continue practicing the skills we've discussed. First, continue using the evidence-gathering technique and reframing negative thoughts that come up for you. Try to write down your thoughts, the evidence for and against them, and the alternative perspectives. Second, continue setting boundaries around your work hours and self-care activities, and be mindful of the impact on your relationships. Finally, consider having a conversation with a colleague about your experience and how they've responded, as we discussed earlier.

Do you have any questions or concerns about the homework or anything else we've talked about today?

Patient: No questions right now, but I appreciate the specific tasks. It gives me something concrete to focus on and work on between sessions. I'll make sure to keep track of my thoughts and continue setting those boundaries.

Therapist: That's great, Alicia. Remember, the homework is meant to help you apply the skills we've discussed in session to your daily life. It's okay if it feels challenging at times, that's just a sign that you're growing and developing new habits.

Before we end today, let's summarize what we covered. We discussed strategies for challenging negative thoughts, including examining the evidence and reframing in a more balanced way. We also talked about the impact of setting boundaries at work on your relationships, and the importance of advocating for yourself and your needs. We assigned homework to help you practice these skills and continue making progress.

With that, let me know if you'd like to schedule another session soon, or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss in the meantime.

Patient: I'd like to schedule another session in two weeks. I think that will give me enough time to work on the homework and reflect on how it's going. Thanks, Nova.
