Therapist: Hello Alicia, it's great to see you again for our 18th CBT session. Thank you for sharing the summary from our previous session. Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge my limitations as an AI therapist. While I can provide guidance and support based on the information you share with me, I don't have access to real-time information or personal details beyond what you provide in our sessions. Additionally, there's a potential for me to generate inaccurate information, and I'm unable to provide crisis intervention or emergency services. I also can't directly observe or interpret non-verbal cues. With that said, I'm here to support you in the best way I can. How have you been since our last session?

Patient: Hi Nova, thanks for the reminder about your limitations. I appreciate your transparency. Since our last session, I've been trying to stick to the work boundaries and self-care activities we discussed. It's been a bit of a struggle, but I'm making progress. I've been leaving work by 6 PM most days, which has been challenging but also kind of liberating. I even managed to go to a salsa class last week, which felt good but also a bit awkward since I haven't been in a while. How about we start by talking about the evidence-gathering and thought reframing homework? I've been documenting my thoughts, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you've been making progress with setting work boundaries and engaging in self-care activities. The salsa class is a wonderful example of how breaking out of your comfort zone can be rewarding, even if it feels a bit awkward at first. Let's dive into the evidence-gathering and thought reframing homework. Can you share an example of a negative thought you've been working on and the evidence you've gathered against it?

Patient: Sure, one of the negative thoughts I've been working on is "I'm not qualified to be a team lead because I don't have enough experience." I've been trying to gather evidence against this thought. For example, I've documented that I successfully completed a complex project last month that required leadership and problem-solving skills. I also received positive feedback from my team members about how I handled the project. But I'm still not sure if I'm fully convinced by this evidence. Can you help me understand how to use this evidence more effectively?

Therapist: Absolutely, Alicia. You've made an excellent point about the evidence you've gathered against the negative thought that you're not qualified to be a team lead. To use this evidence more effectively, we can break it down further and examine it using a thought record. This involves looking at the situation objectively, considering alternative perspectives, and evaluating the evidence for and against the negative thought.

First, let's identify the situation. You were faced with a challenging project that required leadership and problem-solving skills. Is that right?

Patient: Yes, that's correct. The project was challenging, and it required a lot of coordination and problem-solving.

Therapist: Great. Now, let's examine the evidence you've gathered against the negative thought. You mentioned that you successfully completed the project and received positive feedback from your team members. These are concrete examples of your leadership and problem-solving abilities. What do you think about these examples from your work experience?

Patient: I see that these examples show that I do have leadership and problem-solving skills. But sometimes, I still feel like it's just a fluke or that I got lucky. How do I deal with that feeling?

Therapist: That's a great question. When we encounter situations where we feel we've had success, but also have doubts about it, it can be helpful to examine the evidence for and against the doubts. Let's consider this: what would you say to a colleague who expressed a similar doubt about their own leadership and problem-solving skills, based on a successful project they completed?

Patient: If a colleague told me they felt like their success was just a fluke, I'd probably tell them to look at the evidence of their hard work and the positive feedback they received. I'd remind them that success often comes from preparation, effort, and learning from challenges.

Therapist: That's an excellent point. Now, can you apply that same logic to your own situation, considering the evidence you've gathered against the negative thought?

Patient: I guess if I were advising a colleague, I'd tell them to focus on the evidence of their success and the positive feedback. So, for myself, I should acknowledge that I did complete a complex project successfully and received positive feedback, which shows that I do have the skills needed to be a team lead.

Therapist: Exactly. By applying the same logic and focusing on the evidence, you can start to build a more balanced and accurate perspective. It's important to recognize that success and leadership skills are based on real achievements, rather than doubts or external factors like luck.

Let's continue exploring how this evidence can help you challenge other negative thoughts, such as the belief that you're not deserving of a promotion. We can work through this using a similar thought record, where we examine the evidence for and against the thought, and develop a more balanced perspective. How does that sound to you?

Patient: That sounds like a good approach. I'm willing to explore that further. Let's start by examining the evidence for and against the thought that I'm not deserving of a promotion.

Therapist: To start, let's consider the evidence that supports the thought that you're not deserving of a promotion. What comes to mind?

Patient: I guess I can think of times when I felt like I wasn't doing enough, like I was just getting by rather than excelling. There were also moments when I missed deadlines or made small mistakes, which made me question whether I really deserved to be promoted.

Therapist: I understand those concerns, and it's normal to have doubts in the face of challenges or setbacks. Now, let's look at the evidence against the thought that you're not deserving of a promotion. What are some accomplishments or positive feedback you've received that support this alternative perspective?

Patient: Well, I've successfully led a few major projects that were well-received by both my team and management. I've also received positive feedback from my supervisors about my problem-solving skills and my ability to mentor junior developers. Plus, my promotion was based on my performance reviews, which were consistently strong.

Therapist: Those are significant pieces of evidence that support your worthiness for a promotion. It's important to acknowledge and give weight to these accomplishments and positive feedback, even when it's easier to focus on the setbacks or doubts.

Now, let's work on reframing the negative thought in a more balanced way. Based on the evidence you've gathered, how can you adapt the thought "I'm not deserving of a promotion" to better reflect your perspective?

Patient: I think a more balanced thought could be, "While I've faced challenges and made some mistakes, my overall performance and accomplishments demonstrate that I am deserving of the promotion." This way, I'm acknowledging both the challenges and the successes.

Therapist: That's an excellent reframe, Alicia. It acknowledges the challenges you've faced, but places them in the context of your overall performance and accomplishments. This balanced perspective is more likely to promote self-compassion and resilience.

As we continue our work together, we'll explore how this reframe can help you challenge other negative thoughts and build a stronger foundation of self-worth. Remember, our thoughts and beliefs are not always accurate reflections of reality, and by examining the evidence and developing more balanced perspectives, we can start to shift our self-perception in a more positive direction.

Patient: I appreciate the encouragement, Nova. It's helpful to have a structured way to look at these thoughts and see them more clearly. I'll keep practicing this approach and see how it helps in other areas of my life.

Therapist: I'm glad you're finding this approach helpful, Alicia. As we continue our work together, we'll explore how to apply this reframing skill to various situations in your life, helping you develop a more balanced and compassionate view of yourself.

Now, let's shift our focus to your experiences outside of work. You mentioned earlier that you've been more involved in your religious community and have been volunteering as a mentor. How have these activities been impacting your mood and sense of purpose?

###.

Patient: Volunteering and being involved in my religious community has been a mixed experience. On one hand, it gives me a sense of purpose and helps me feel connected to something larger than myself. On the other hand, it can be overwhelming at times, especially when I'm already feeling drained from work and personal issues. I'm trying to find a balance, but it's not always easy.

Therapist: It's understandable that engaging in meaningful activities like volunteering and being part of a religious community can provide a sense of purpose, but it can also be challenging, especially when you're already dealing with other stressors in your life. Balancing these responsibilities can be difficult, and it's okay to recognize when you need a break or to prioritize your own well-being.

Let's explore how we can help you manage the balance between your work, personal life, and the activities that bring you joy or purpose. One technique that can be helpful is setting boundaries and practicing self-care. Can you share an example of a time when you struggled to set boundaries or prioritize self-care?

Patient: I remember last month when I agreed to take on an extra mentoring session because the person who usually does it was unavailable. I ended up feeling exhausted and couldn't focus on my work the next day. It made me realize that I need to be more mindful of my limits and not overcommit myself.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Alicia. Recognizing the impact of overcommitting and pushing yourself beyond your limits is an important step in setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care. Let's work together to develop a plan for setting boundaries and managing your responsibilities more effectively.

One strategy is to create a schedule or timeline for your commitments, including work, personal life, and self-care activities. This can help you see where you might be overextending yourself and make it easier to set boundaries.

Another strategy is to practice saying no or renegotiating commitments when you feel overwhelmed or unprepared. It's okay to communicate your needs and limitations with others, and it's a sign of strength, not weakness, to prioritize your well-being.

What do you think about these strategies, and how might you apply them in your own life?

Patient: I think creating a schedule is a good idea. It would help me visualize where my time is going and make it easier to see when I'm overcommitting. As for saying no, it's something I struggle with, but I know it's important for my well-being. I'll try to be more mindful of that and practice it when I feel overwhelmed.

Therapist: These are great ideas, Alicia. Creating a schedule can help you gain clarity and make more intentional decisions about how you spend your time. And practicing saying no and renegotiating commitments when you need to is an essential part of setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care.

Another helpful strategy is to identify the thoughts and beliefs that might be holding you back from setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care. For example, you might have the belief that "I need to always put others' needs before my own," or "If I say no, people will think I'm lazy or unhelpful." These beliefs can make it difficult to set boundaries, but they're not necessarily accurate.

Let's explore these beliefs together. Can you think of a specific example of a time when you felt a belief like this, and how it impacted your ability to set boundaries or prioritize self-care?

Patient: I remember feeling that way when I was asked to lead a new project at work. I thought if I said no, my team would think I wasn't capable or committed. So, I took it on even though I was already overwhelmed. It led to burnout and made me less effective in my other responsibilities.

Therapist: That's a great example, Alicia. It shows how beliefs like "I need to always put others' needs before my own" can impact your ability to set boundaries and prioritize self-care. When we hold these beliefs, we might feel guilty or worried about how others will perceive us if we don't always prioritize their needs.

One way to challenge these beliefs is to examine the evidence for and against them. For example, what would be the consequences of you setting a boundary in a situation like the one you described? How might it impact your well-being and ability to support others effectively?

Patient: If I had set a boundary and said no to the new project, I might have avoided burnout and been more effective in my existing responsibilities. It could have allowed me to better support my team and maintain my own well-being. I guess the fear of others' perceptions was more harmful than the actual consequences of setting a boundary.

Therapist: Exactly, Alicia. When we challenge these beliefs and consider the evidence, we can start to see that they might not be serving us as well as we thought. Setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care is not selfish; it's an essential part of maintaining our well-being and supporting others effectively.

Another strategy that can be helpful is to communicate your needs and limitations assertively, using "I" statements. This means expressing your feelings and needs using "I" language rather than "you" language, which can often come across as accusatory or blaming.

For example, instead of saying "You're asking too much of me," you might say "I feel overwhelmed when I take on too many projects, and I need to prioritize my own well-being in order to support others effectively. Would it be possible to consider some other team members' availability or redistribute some tasks to other projects?"

How do you think using "I" statements and communicating your needs assertively could be helpful in setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care?

Patient: Using "I" statements sounds like a good approach. It would help me express my feelings and needs without sounding accusatory. I think it would make it easier for others to understand my perspective and be more receptive to my boundaries. It's something I can practice in my daily interactions.

Therapist: Using "I" statements can be a powerful tool for communicating your needs and setting boundaries in a way that is respectful and assertive. It can help you build stronger relationships and avoid the negative consequences that come with being overly accommodating or saying "yes" to every request.

As we continue our work together, we'll practice using "I" statements and exploring how they can be applied in different situations. We'll also work on developing other skills, such as self-compassion and mindfulness, to support your overall well-being.

Before we wrap up today's session, I'd like to check in with you about your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.

Patient: I feel a bit more hopeful after our discussion today. It's reassuring to know that there are strategies I can use to set boundaries and take care of myself better. I'm looking forward to practicing these techniques and seeing how they can help me manage my workload and personal life more effectively.

Therapist: It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful, Alicia. Remember that progress is often gradual, and it's okay to take small steps forward. Celebrating your successes, no matter how small they may seem, is an important part of the journey.

Before we end our session, let's discuss some homework to help you practice the skills we've covered today. I'd like you to continue using the thought record to examine the evidence for and against negative thoughts and challenge them using reframing techniques. I also encourage you to practice setting boundaries and communicating your needs assertively, using "I" statements.

Additionally, I'd like you to create a schedule for your commitments, including work, personal life, and self-care activities. This will help you visualize where your time is going and make it easier to set boundaries and prioritize self-care.

How do you feel about this homework, and do you have any questions or concerns?

Patient: I think the homework is manageable and practical. I'm ready to give it a try. I do have a question about the thought record. Can you give me an example of how to use it to challenge a negative thought? I want to make sure I'm doing it correctly.

Therapist: Absolutely, Alicia. Let's take an example of a negative thought you might encounter and walk through how to use the thought record to challenge and reframe it.

Suppose you have the thought, "I'm not good enough to be a team lead." First, you would write down the situation or trigger, which in this case is feeling like you're not good enough for a leadership role.

Next, you would write down the emotion you're experiencing and its intensity. Let's say you feel inadequate and sad, with an intensity of 8 out of 10.

Then, you would write down the automatic thought, which is "I'm not good enough to be a team lead."

Now, comes the important part – examining the evidence for and against the thought. On one side, you might write down evidence like "I don't have as much experience as some of the other team leads" or "I've made mistakes in the past." On the other side, you might write down evidence like "I've successfully completed multiple projects as a team member" or "I've received positive feedback from my team members."

Once you've identified the evidence, you would then look for alternative perspectives. For example, you might consider that leadership skills can be developed over time, and that having the ability to mentor and support others is an important aspect of leadership.

Finally, you would reframe the original thought in a more balanced way, taking into account the evidence and alternative perspectives. In this case, a reframed thought might be, "While I may not have as much experience as some of the other team leads, I have demonstrated leadership skills through my successes and positive feedback. Leadership skills can be developed, and I am capable of growing in this role."

After reframing the thought, you would rate the intensity of the emotion again. Let's say the sadness has decreased to a 4 out of 10, and the intensity of feeling inadequate has decreased to a 5 out of 10.

This is a powerful tool for challenging negative thoughts and developing a more balanced perspective. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate negative thoughts altogether, but rather to examine them objectively and develop a more compassionate and realistic perspective.

How does this example help you understand how to use the thought record?

Patient: This example helps a lot, actually. I can see how breaking down the thought into different parts and looking at the evidence on both sides can make it less overwhelming. It's like dissecting a problem into smaller pieces so you can see it more clearly. I guess it's easier to challenge a thought when you have evidence to back up your perspective. I can definitely see myself using this method when I start feeling like I'm not good enough, especially at work. It gives me a structured way to deal with those negative thoughts instead of just letting them spiral.

Therapist: That's a great insight, Alicia. Dissecting the thought and examining the evidence can make it feel more manageable and less overwhelming. It's a way of taking a step back and looking at things from a different angle, which can help you see things in a more balanced way.

As you practice this skill, it will become easier to identify negative thoughts and challenge them in the moment. It's like building a muscle – the more you use it, the stronger it gets.

Another helpful aspect of the thought record is that it encourages you to develop more balanced and compassionate thinking patterns over time. By consistently examining your thoughts and challenging the negative ones, you can start to shift your overall thinking patterns and build a more resilient mindset.

Before we end today's session, I want to check in with you about your current mood and any final thoughts you'd like to share.

Patient: I feel more grounded after our discussion today. It's comforting to know that I have tools to deal with my negative thoughts and that I can gradually improve my thinking patterns. I'm looking forward to practicing these techniques and seeing how they can help me manage my emotions better. I guess I'm realizing that it's okay to not have all the answers right away and that progress is something that happens over time.

Therapist: That's a wonderful insight, Alicia. Recognizing that progress is a gradual process and that it's okay not to have all the answers right away is an important part of the journey. It's great that you feel more grounded and have a sense of hope going forward.

Thank you for your openness and engagement in our session today. I'm confident that with continued practice and effort, you will start to see improvements in your mood and overall well-being.

Before we wrap up, let's schedule our next session. I'd like to continue our work on challenging negative thoughts and developing more balanced thinking patterns. I'd also like to explore how we can apply the thought record to different areas of your life and support you in setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care.

Do you feel comfortable scheduling a follow-up session in two weeks, and are there any other topics you'd like to add to the agenda?

Patient: I'm comfortable with scheduling a follow-up session in two weeks. I think it's important to keep working on challenging negative thoughts and setting boundaries. I'd also like to explore how I can better integrate self-care into my daily routine without feeling guilty about it. I've been struggling with that lately, and I think it's something we can work on together.
