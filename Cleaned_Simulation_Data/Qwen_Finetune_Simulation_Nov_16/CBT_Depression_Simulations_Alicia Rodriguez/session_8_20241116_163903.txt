Therapist: Last session, we discussed and practiced the Core Belief Worksheet, focusing on your core belief of "I'm not good enough." You've been tracking evidence for and against this belief, as well as practicing thought reframing when you notice self-critical thoughts. How has this experience been for you?

Patient: It's been... challenging, to be honest. I've been trying to track evidence for and against the belief that "I'm not good enough," but it feels like I'm constantly battling with myself. On one hand, I can see all the times I've succeeded and the positive feedback I've received, but on the other hand, those moments of doubt and self-criticism still creep in. It's like I'm trying to convince myself of something I'm not sure I believe yet.

Therapist: I understand that it can feel like an uphill battle, especially when you've been dealing with these negative core beliefs for a long time. The fact that you're noticing these moments of doubt and self-criticism is actually a sign of progress. It means you're developing more awareness of your thought patterns and how they impact your emotions and behaviors. Can you share an example of a situation where you practiced thought reframing?

Patient: Sure, there was a recent incident where I missed a code review deadline. Normally, I would have spiraled into thinking, "See, you're not cut out for this leadership role," but instead, I tried to reframe it. I reminded myself that everyone makes mistakes and that this one oversight didn't erase all the successful projects I've led. It was still hard, but it felt a bit less overwhelming than it would have before.

Therapist: That's a great example of thought reframing. You were able to challenge that automatic negative thought and provide a more balanced, realistic perspective. It's okay that it still felt hard; the goal isn't to eliminate negative thoughts altogether, but to develop the skill of recognizing them and responding to them in a healthier way. 

Given what you've shared, I'd like to propose a few items for our agenda today. We could continue working on thought reframing and building on the Core Belief Worksheet. We could also explore the idea of cognitive distortions and how they may be reinforcing those negative core beliefs. And finally, we could discuss your experience with behavioral activation, particularly in the context of your isolating yourself when feeling down. How does that sound to you?

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. I think exploring cognitive distortions could be helpful, especially if it helps me understand why I keep falling back into those negative thought patterns. And I'm definitely open to talking more about behavioral activation, since I know I've been withdrawing more than I should.

Therapist: I'm glad that agenda sounds good to you. Let's start by exploring cognitive distortions. One common distortion is "all-or-nothing thinking" – believing things are only good or bad, without any in-between. Another is "disqualifying the positive" – dismissing or minimizing positive experiences or qualities. Do you feel like either of these might resonate with you?

Patient: Yeah, I think "all-or-nothing thinking" definitely resonates. I often feel like if I'm not perfect, then I'm a failure. And "disqualifying the positive" is something I do too. I'll get positive feedback, but then I'll think, "Well, it's just because they don't know the whole story." It's like I can't fully accept the good things without finding a way to undermine them.

Therapist: That's a really astute observation. These distortions can make it very hard to maintain a balanced, realistic perspective. Another distortion that might be relevant for you is "disqualifying the positive" – dismissing or minimizing positive experiences or qualities. For example, you might get a compliment from a colleague but think, "They're just saying that to be nice." or "I didn't work that hard, it was easy." Can you think of a recent situation where you might have engaged in this type of distortion?

Patient: Yeah, there was a situation last week where my boss praised my work on a project. I should have felt good about it, but instead, I just thought, "It was an easy project, anyone could have done it." I didn't really let myself feel proud or happy about it. It's like I can't accept that I did something well without finding a way to downplay it.

Therapist: That's a great insight. It sounds like you're using some of those cognitive distortions to protect yourself from potentially negative emotions – in this case, pride or enjoyment. But in reality, you're just shooting yourself in the foot. The fact that you contributed successfully to that project deserves celebration, not dismissal.

Patient: I guess you're right. It's like I'm so used to being critical of myself that I can't even let myself enjoy the good stuff. It's frustrating because I know I should be proud of my achievements, but it's hard to break that habit.

Therapist: Changing those long-standing patterns takes time and practice, but it's definitely possible. One way to start is by setting up a thought record like we've done before. When you notice yourself dismissing positive experiences, you can pause and write down the situation, your emotions, and then the automatic thought. Then, you can look for evidence that supports or refutes that thought and come up with an alternative perspective.

Patient: That sounds like a good idea. But I'm not sure exactly how to fill out the thought record for something like this. Can you give me an example of how that would look for dismissing positive experiences?

Therapist: Of course. Let's say you receive a compliment on your work from a colleague. In the "situation" column, you'd write "Colleague compliments my work." In the "emotions" column, you might write "Flattered, a bit awkward." In the "automatic thought" column, you'd write something like "They're just saying that to be nice" or "It's not like it's anything major." 

Then, in the "evidence" column, you'd look for evidence that supports or refutes that thought. It might look like evidence for the thought is "It's just a small project, anyone could have done it" or "I didn't work that hard." 

But you might also find evidence against the thought, like "They've seen me contribute to other projects and tasks," "I've gotten positive feedback on my work before," or "I'm good at what I do, even if there are times I doubt myself."

Finally, in the "alternative thought" column, you'd try to come up with a more balanced, realistic perspective, like "My colleague genuinely thinks I did a good job," or "I am skilled and capable, and my work is valuable."

How does that sound like a process?

Patient: That makes sense. It's like I need to actively challenge those negative thoughts and find a way to see the positive side more clearly. I think I can try that next time I get a compliment or positive feedback. It might help me start to break that habit of dismissing the good stuff.

Therapist: Exactly. It's about training your brain to look for alternative perspectives and not just get stuck in those negative thought spirals. And the more you practice it, the more automatic it will become.

Another helpful thing to keep in mind is that our thoughts are not always accurate reflections of reality. They're often influenced by our feelings and our core beliefs, which can lead us to distort or filter information in ways that keep us stuck in negative patterns. By using thought records and challenging those automatic thoughts, you can start to create more balanced and realistic thinking patterns.

Patient: Yeah, I think I get it. It's like my brain is used to seeing things in a certain way, and it takes effort to change that. But if I can start to recognize when I'm doing it and then challenge those thoughts, maybe I can start to see things more clearly. It's definitely something I want to work on.

Therapist: You're right, it is a process of changing those long-standing patterns. And the effort you're putting into understanding and challenging those thoughts is really great. As we continue to work together, I'm sure you'll start to find it easier to recognize and reframe those automatic thoughts.

Speaking of continuing to work together, I want to check in on how you're feeling about the things we've discussed today. Has anything resonated with you, or given you any ideas for how to move forward?

Patient: I think the thought record idea really resonated with me. It's something concrete I can do to start challenging those negative thoughts. I also realized that I need to be more mindful of when I'm dismissing positive experiences, so I can start to change that habit. I think I'll try to keep a thought record for the next few weeks and see how it goes.

Therapist: That's great to hear. The thought record is a really powerful tool for building self-awareness and challenging negative thought patterns. And I think you're right that being mindful of those moments of dismissing positive experiences can help you start to change that habit.

As you're working on that, I want to check in on how you're feeling. How's your mood today? Have you noticed any changes in your thought patterns since our last session?

Patient: My mood is okay, I guess. I've been feeling a bit more tired than usual, but I think that's just because of the long hours at work. I haven't really noticed any changes in my thought patterns yet, but I'm hoping that using the thought record will help with that. I'm trying to be more mindful of when I'm dismissing positive experiences, but it's still a work in progress.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're hoping the thought record will help. It is a process, and it's okay if you don't notice changes right away. The fact that you're aware of those moments and trying to challenge them is a really important step.

I want to make sure we have time to discuss your experience with behavioral activation, too. You mentioned in our last session that you've been feeling more isolated and withdrawn since moving to a new city. How has that been going?

Patient: Yeah, it's been tough. I haven't really made any new friends here yet, and I've been canceling on the few social events I've been invited to. I think I'm just feeling really overwhelmed with everything else going on, and it's easier to stay home and work or read. But I know that's not good for me in the long run.

Therapist: It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, especially with the work stress and the new city. The isolation you're experiencing is something we can definitely work on together. Have you tried any of the activities we talked about last time, like joining a gaming group or a cooking club?

Patient: I haven't tried those yet, no. I guess I just haven't made the time for it. I've been so focused on work and trying to keep up with everything that I haven't really thought about it. But I know I need to start making an effort to get out more and meet people.

Therapist: It's great that you recognize that you need to start making an effort to get out more and meet people. We can definitely brainstorm some ideas for how you can start to do that. One thing that might be helpful is to set some small, achievable goals for the week, like reaching out to a friend or attending a social event.

Another thing to keep in mind is that it's okay to take baby steps. You don't have to dive into a new social group right away. Maybe you could start by just going for a walk around the city or meeting a friend for a coffee. Those small things can help you start to feel more connected and less isolated.

Patient: Yeah, I think setting small goals is a good idea. I can start by reaching out to a friend or coworker and see if they want to grab coffee or something. And maybe I can try going for a walk around the city on the weekends. It's a start, at least.

Therapist: That's a great plan. Starting with small, manageable goals is a great way to build momentum and feel more connected over time. And remember, it's okay if some of those interactions don't go perfectly. The important thing is that you're putting yourself out there and giving yourself a chance to connect with others.

As you're working on that, I want to make sure we're on the same page about your therapy goals. We've talked about things like reducing rumination, managing work stress, and improving relationships. How have you been feeling about those goals?

Patient: I think I'm making progress with reducing rumination, especially since I started using the thought record. But I still feel like I have a long way to go with managing work stress and improving my relationships. I guess I just need to keep working on it and take it one step at a time.

Therapist: I'm glad to hear that you're making progress with reducing rumination. It's great that you're using the thought record to help with that. And you're right, managing work stress and improving relationships are long-term goals that take consistent effort and practice.

Remember, it's not about being perfect. It's about taking steps in the right direction and being patient with yourself. Every small change counts, and every effort you make is a step forward. As you continue to work on these goals, we'll keep refining our strategies and problem-solving any challenges that come up.

Before we wrap up today, I want to check in on how you're feeling now. What are your main takeaways from our session today?

Patient: My main takeaway is that I need to start setting small, achievable goals for myself to get out more and meet people. I also need to keep using the thought record to help with my rumination and be patient with myself as I work on managing my work stress and improving my relationships. It's a process, but I'm willing to keep working on it.

Therapist: That's a great summary of our session today. Setting small, achievable goals is a wonderful way to start building momentum and feeling more connected. And I'm glad you're willing to keep using the thought record to help with your rumination and managing your work stress.

Remember, progress isn't always linear, and there will be ups and downs. But every small step you take is a step forward, and every effort you make is a step closer to your goals.

For homework, I'd like you to continue using the thought record, focusing on any instances of dismissing positive experiences. I also encourage you to reach out to a friend or coworker to make plans for a coffee or social event, and start setting small goals for exploring new activities in the city on the weekends. How does that sound to you?

Patient: That sounds good. I'll keep using the thought record and try to reach out to someone for coffee or a social event. And I'll start setting small goals for exploring the city on the weekends. Thanks for the support, Nova.
